Hi, I'm Bruno Alves and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Torbjörn Siser, Chairman and Senior Partner at Global Mid-Market Manager Actis. Actis has been investing across energy, digital, and new economy real estate in the world's growth markets for more than 20 years, or as Torbjörn likes to call them, most markets given they represent over 85% of the world's population. We discuss why perception risk is still the main impediment to channeling more LP capital into these markets, why the current volatility does not change the immense need for critical infrastructure, how demand offers the strongest risk mitigation, which markets offer the best opportunities and much more. Hi Torbjörn, welcome to the podcast. Great to be here, Bruno. So we're at this moment in time when it feels like old notions are being turned on their head a bit. So we have significant volatility originating from the US, which is a premier OECD market, and the kind of volatility that rightly or wrongly, many people actually associate with some of the growth markets that Actis traditionally invests in. So my first question to you is, are you seeing any change in mindset, particularly amongst LPs, towards the growth markets you invest in? I mean, it's clearly a topic of the last couple of weeks, or many weeks, I guess, the whole, you know, volatility and what does that mean for us as an investor, you know, both Actis, but also, you know, in the bigger picture. So it's a big discussion. But I think one thing coming out of that is that there are uncertainties here. And we don't really know exactly where the tariffs will land. But uncertainty, I think, then that drives the question of diversification. And then diversification, I would say, away from the US market or their dependence on that. And the other one is maybe having done more of infrastructure, which clearly has that stable contracted cash flow characteristics. And if you add the two of them, you know, going to the non US, non European markets where we are focusing in infrastructure, I think, actually, we are one of the great beneficiaries of this. So this has been one of the key discussions with our LPs the last many weeks. I guess the flip side to this, if I'm playing a bit devil's advocate, is you put all of this volatility in the mix and all of this uncertainty. And then you get people thinking, well, actually, some of these growth markets may be more vulnerable to the current environment. And thus, you know, I'm already a little bit as an LP afraid of going into them. And now I'm even more afraid. So I'm wondering if you're seeing some of that, too. Yeah, I mean, I would say no. And I think that if you're looking at it, yes, if you look at North-South trade, and that can have some implications clearly towards US and European markets. But if you look at the South-South trade, I mean, there's no new tariffs between Brazil and China or between Mexico and India or, you know, so that trade, which has overtaken the North-South trade many years back and is growing much faster, that is stronger than ever. And if you're looking at that for those markets with the non-US and non-European ones, you know, most of the world, I would call it, in a way, 85% of the world population lives, I think trade and growth that underpins the need for critical infrastructure is growing more stable than ever. Yeah. And in a way, I'm guessing that story is perhaps coming out to the forefront a bit more than. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So Adrian, you've been doing this for many, many years, and we've been sort of talking about the industry and how can capital move into these growth markets when traditionally it's always concentrated in the markets, the traditional OECD markets. So if I ask you now in 2025, what is the main impediment or the main impediments to us seeing more infrastructure capital flowing to some of these markets? What's on the list? Yeah. So I think the number one is probably perception, perception of risk versus real risk, but I think it's changing. I think that we see more capital coming to most of the world, so the non-US and non-European markets. I think we then see more competitive capital coming, and we welcome that, and we want more capital into these markets. So I think then that the South-South trade and the fundamental growth that is happening there, and this is, you know, you build, produce, and consume critical infrastructure locally is, you know, less dependent on, therefore, tariff discussions and the likes. And I think that simplistic view of where, therefore, fundamental investment needs are, I mean, people get it. And I think, therefore, the perception of risk is slowly changing, and I think more capital is coming into these markets. On that note, actually, in terms of risk management, one tool that seems to be gaining in popularity is blended finance, and actually I'm seeing it grow in popularity in a private fund, private capital context, actually, because it's obviously been around in other instruments for quite a while. But in this private fund context, what do you make of its growing use to channel investments into these markets? I mean, in some ways, I mean, there are some markets I think that that may be relevant, but where we invest, it's not needed. I mean, in my 30-plus years in this, or 35 years in investing, I've never seen a bankable deal not getting capital. So I think it is some sort of a misunderstanding that you can solve everything by just having more capital flowing in. That's just not what is needed. There's plenty of capital, you know, available on the planet, and it will flow to the best risk returns when it's there. So if you structure deals in the right way, capital is there. So the question of getting capital to, you know, certain parts of the world, I'm not sure subsidy is the right tool, actually. I think it's much more making sure that you have the resources and all the people with the right competences to create, therefore, structures which are transparent, you know, without an uncertainty, and capital will flow. So you cannot avoid that and then just flood it with subsidized capital. So I don't think that is a solution. There might be some markets where you want to have some more aid money to flow in to get economies going, but clearly, you know, most of the world outside the US and Europe is a big place, and we are not in those markets. We are in markets where you have fundamental needs for infrastructure, and people are very happy to pay for it. Yeah. Do you think there's a little bit of a, to go back to your earlier comment about perception as an impediment into doing business in these markets, is this almost a sometimes blended finance a little bit of an expensive solve for the mind, a little bit of expensive reassurement then for people to just get comfortable? That's my opinion. Yes. Okay. I also wanted to ask you this at the time we're recording, you've you've actually just the day before, you've just announced the close of your your second long life infrastructure fund. And it's focused on operational assets, you know, in many of these markets. And I always thought that that is actually maybe a very good way of getting people comfortable with some of these markets, because you take some of the greenfield risk out of the equation. Here are these operating assets, they've got a track record and so on and so forth. And you're at your second time around. So I just want to ask you to share a bit how people are thinking about that product and then whether you see further growth for similar products. Yeah. I think you're right. If you're looking at I mean, it's our second product. So the core of what we do, you can say we are builders, we are builders and operators, we construct new infrastructure, you know, that gap of supply and demand for infrastructure and therefore get that that new capital to come in to actually create new infrastructure. That said, clearly over time, we've seen that there is now an installed base of existing infrastructure where someone like us can come in and actually do quite a good job of improving existing cash flows and therefore drive the returns up. And you're right, those type of investments, the perception of risk there is lower because I mean, they're already built and operating and cash flows are flowing. And I think here is a fantastic opportunity in the sense that, you know, this is core or core plus infrastructure where we can generate value add returns because of the mismatch between supply and demand of opportunities and supply and demand of capital. So it's clearly is a way of coming into these markets on a lower risk yielding proposition. We are at a moment where everybody is focused on DPI, everybody is focused on exits. And so maybe for the listener that is less familiar with some of these markets, could you give an overview of your exit experience in some of these markets? Yeah, I mean, if you look at the last 23 years here and the various funds we had, I mean, we've done a total of 200 exits. So we clearly have an experience of exiting transactions. And I believe we are, you know, top quarter, top deficit in terms of getting DPI back to our investors. So I would say well-structured transactions, you know, do have a real need for new, you know, GPs and others who want, strategics who wants to come in and own these assets. So we haven't seen a lack of buyers and therefore a issue with exits really. And it probably comes then from that, you know, more capital coming into our markets and therefore there is an inflow. And if there is therefore, should we say a shortage of quality assets that someone like us have built, clearly we can then, you know, sell that in a pretty, pretty good way into that demand for assets that we created. And that's actually, that was going to be my next question, so I'm just going to ease into it. But that the people or the institutions you exit to, surely you've seen a change over the years, right? Precisely because you now have, let's call it some of the more traditional blue chip managers also going into these markets. So how would you peg the evolution of the capital you now exit to? Yeah, I mean, we've seen a broader group of, you know, exit routes that, you know, that we can exit to. So if you go back some 20 years back, I mean, I think it were clearly strategics and there were global strategics in the power space as we are focusing on power specifically. Over time we saw regional power companies and regional strategies come in as exit routes. And I think it's the latest is that we have funds, big infrastructure funds interested in our markets and the assets that we are creating and the companies that we are building. So yes, it's been a shift. And I think that that just gets us, you know, the broader set of potential ways of exiting. You know, when it comes to infrastructure as an asset class, we talk a lot about the sanctity of contracts, even though there's been significant volatility in OECD regulated assets. You often make the point, as you've done here already, that there is a supply demand gap that exists in growth markets that kind of works as the best risk mitigation you could ever have. And so I'm just wondering, again, for people less familiar with these markets, maybe you can just explain a bit better what you mean by this. Yeah, I mean, I think that supply and demand drives everything in life in many ways, right? It drives risk, it drives returns, risk return and the like. So if we're looking at the non-US and non-European markets, that's where you have 85% of the world population. That's because of demographics, urbanization and the likes and economic growth. I mean, you have some 90% of economic growth going forward in those markets. And two thirds, or actually about 70% of all needs and opportunities in infrastructure and in power specifically is in these markets, the non-US and non-European markets. But at the same time, the majority of the capital, two thirds, give or take, is focusing on bidding each other up in the US and Europe. So to be in markets where two thirds of the opportunities are and only one third of the capital chasing it, that creates an absolute fantastic risk return prospect where you are. And I also think that drives the fundamental risks. Because if you have a product that everyone wants, it's in a short supply, electricity is a critical infrastructure in a country, people will pay for that. If they don't need the product, if there's an oversupply of electricity, first at that time will people start looking at contracts, do I really need to and how about this and that? And yes, I need to deliver now renewable energy into an oversupply German market or what have you. But that just doesn't happen if you have a shortage of the product you're selling. So I think that mismatch between supply and demand, opportunity and capital is fundamental in looking at risk analysis. And I think it's much more important in every project that we look at than the contract. Of course, we look at the contract and that they are there and that we have the legal structure and so on around it. But fundamentally, it's to have a product that people really, really want. And do you feel that need in a way sort of insulates against, let's say, major contractual changes or major ups and downs, so to speak? No, no, I really do. I think that, you know, again, if you have a client who is very keen to get your product, they will pay. They will not look at the contract and saying that, I mean, of course, they will follow the contract, but they're very keen to have a relationship with you where you provide that critical infrastructure and they pay for it. They are in desperate need of it. And that is always the best risk mitigant. We're likely entering into a period of, let's call it prolonged inflation. And even though infrastructure is good inflation hedging capabilities, I think there's always a question of affordability once inflation is sticky and it's constantly there. So all of what you've been saying makes a lot of sense and is true about how demand is strong and thus what you build is needed. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about persistent inflation and affordability is a key concern, because I'm guessing that in some of these markets, affordability is more front of mind, perhaps, than in some of the other ones. I mean, you know, the whole most of world universe, non-US and Europe is clearly not just one uniform markets. It's very different markets in there. So it can be different pictures in different parts of the world. But if we're looking at specifically the affordability question, you can say the most expensive power is no power. So if you don't have reliable power, that is the most costly of everything, right? So I think, therefore, the willingness to then pay for critical infrastructure and specifically electricity, you know, it's there because it is more expensive not to have it. Yeah, that makes sense. And Torbjörn, as you've mentioned, you know, being builders several times here. So again, in this particular period with some of the, again, the increased costs and the supply chain disruption we've had for a while, and it's likely getting worse. How are you as a builder being affected? How are costs for your projects changing, increasing? Talk us a little bit through that. Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, you can say have a deglobalization that you're referring to there. And you can say the tariffs has a negative impact in general of growth. However, you're looking at these economies again, you know, if you're in Southeast Asia and you have six, seven, eight percent, you know, economic growth set, there are local growth activities happening there. They need critical infrastructure. And again, as I said, we build and, you know, you use and consume electricity and critical infrastructure locally. So it's a very local activity from that point of view. Then you can say, are the global supply chains, are they changing a little bit? Yeah. I don't know what some of them are, but I think that there's more the global EPC supplies that then deliver, you know, the power plants and the likes, you know, they will then localize their production. So I see a very positive picture nevertheless here in terms of the need for critical infrastructure in the markets where we invest. And it's true, when you tend to talk about growth markets, you know, sometimes you make this mistake of talking about it as a, you know, rest of the world type of thing. You're in a pretty good position to actually take us on a little bit of a tour here. And so, again, for listeners that may be less familiar, tell us in which regions you are seeing the most opportunities and also across which sectors? Thank you. Yeah. So growth markets, or I'd like to call it most markets, because that's where most markets is probably more accurate. So if you look at it, I mean, clearly Latin America has been an area where we invested significantly in the past, and we see lots and lots of opportunities there. If you then, you know, move Eastern Europe, where you have both, you know, a need for energy and also energy security coming in there as an important element in that whole area. India. India has been one of our success stories, and that is just continuing, you know, forward big, big, big time. The need and the structure in that market is also very attractive to us as investors. And I would say Southeast Asia. So we're doing a number of things here in Southeast Asia lately. So it's really across the globe. And if you look at the sectors, I mean, our focus is number one is electricity and power. The other one is digital. And I think that if you're looking at digital and power, they somehow come together a little bit over time here now, because if you look at, say, data centers, I mean, the need for electricity there is very significant. And that need, you know, is more and more also for green energy. And if you then are a leader in the electricity space in our markets, and you therefore know and understand how you actually can secure that power to those data centers and to that digital side of the infrastructure space.
