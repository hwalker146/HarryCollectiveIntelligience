--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, and welcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. I'm Chuck Stanley, senior energy reporter for InfraLogic, and today I have the distinct privilege of speaking with two senior members of the Macquarie Asset Management Team. Aaron Rubin is the head of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets Energy Investment Team in North America, and Will Demmes is the senior managing director and head of Americas for Macquarie's Green Investment Team. We are living in interesting times, as the saying goes. Donald Trump's return to the White House in January has driven an about-face in U.S. energy policy objectives, from the Biden administration's emphasis on climate and sustainability to a preference under Trump for conventional firm power. On top of that, the ongoing rollercoaster around the Trump administration's tariff initiatives has injected new uncertainty into supply chains throughout the energy and infrastructure sectors, and the recently passed GOP budget bill has rewritten the landscape for energy incentives in the United States. Will and Aaron bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the show, and while they said they agree more often than not with regard to trends they see in the market, it's a great time to have them both on the show to give a well-rounded perspective on where the challenges and opportunities are out there in these uncertain times. Will, Aaron, thanks so much for joining us today. Thanks for having us, Chuck. Yeah, thank you, Chuck. I'm looking forward to the conversation. As am I. And most of our listeners will no doubt be familiar with Macquarie's work in the global energy and infrastructure sector, but I'd love to start off by having each of you tell the audience a little bit about your roles with the firm and what situations you primarily work on. Will, would you like to go first? Thanks, Chuck. As you mentioned, I lead our green investment team here in the Americas, but the green investment team is a global team, so we are actually active across the globe. Macquarie as an institution has been investing in energy transition, whether it's offshore wind, solar molecules, for 20 years, and we've deployed almost $20 billion into the sector. And so we've been investors in the sector for a while now, and so it's really ingrained in our institution. And as such, we've created a dedicated team that's focusing on the sector, and that team has been around since 2017 when we acquired the UK Green Investment Bank. And since then, we've built out that team and have subsequently raised a number of dedicated funds for our LPs and clients that are more pure play green investment strategies. Aaron will tell you about his strategy as well, but the areas that we're focusing on are really twofold. Number one, the decarbonization of the power sector, so that's solar and wind, geothermal hydro batteries, and then also the decarbonization of the industrial sector. We're currently focusing on things like renewable fuels, green and blue hydrogen, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, circular economy, and clean grid. So it's a pretty wide mandate, and combined with sort of the flagship Macquarie strategies, I think we really cover a very wide opportunity set within the energy infrastructure world. I'm Aaron Rubin, I lead our energy investment team in the Americas, as you said, Chuck. My focus areas include regulated utilities, water, gas, and electric, which has been a really big target sector for us globally for over 20 years, as well as unregulated energy opportunities defined quite broadly for our diversified infrastructure funds. So that includes midstream power and a wide variety of other things. Will's team and mine collaborate very closely, and we really try to adopt a holistic investment approach. We physically sit next to each other, and a lot of our focus areas are pretty complementary. So for example, some of the biggest portfolio companies in my portfolio are electric utilities in the US, whereas some of Will's biggest focus is with wind and solar and battery developers. Our utilities have got a huge demand to build and install that sort of generation, so you can immediately see how the collaboration between those companies can add a lot of value on both sides. And it definitely seems like a busy and complicated time to be operating in all of these spaces. I appreciate you guys taking the time to appear on the show and share your thoughts. As I indicated in the intro, this year has seen some major shifts in the investment environment around energy, renewables, and the energy transition, both from a policy standpoint and macroeconomic trends. Renewables investors have been telling me that the uncertainty in particular can create real challenges when talking about long-term commitments in this space. Will, approaching this market from the standpoint of a green investment focus, are there particular sectors or types of deals where you do see more opportunity to be active right now? And do you see a bit more certainty emerging within the policy landscape as we get sort of further into this first year of the Trump administration? I'll start by saying, again, that we are a global strategy. So uncertainty really is relative to what's happening here in the U.S., but obviously that impacts the global opportunity. But I'll focus today on the U.S. because I think that's what you're alluding to in terms of uncertainty. But obviously, we've benefited for over 20 or 30 years from the tax credits that were helping accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in the United States. And it was always kind of uncertain before the IRA. Every other year, basically, it was being renewed, and there was always a bit of uncertainty in whether it would be renewed or not. So we've dealt with this, right? And I'm not saying that's the way we want to deal with it, but we've kind of grown up with this uncertainty, and we thought it was resolved with the Inflation Reduction Act. But obviously, what's going on right now is somewhat unwinding the certainty that act intended to provide. That's OK. We believe that the fundamentals of particularly wind and solar in this increased load and demand environment still holds true. And while the uncertainty around whether or not the support will be there or not, we actually don't believe that we need it, right? And that's maybe a bit of a controversial statement. We haven't changed our view in terms of the opportunity set based on today's uncertainty. We just, as an investor, certainty is always better than not, right? And so despite the outcome of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and sort of the wind down of the credits earlier than expected, at least that gave us certainty in sort of where things were heading, or we thought that was the case. But shortly after, there was an executive order that kind of asked the agencies to look at how you actually qualify for those credits in the next short period of time, which creates more uncertainty because there's strategies of how to safe harbor and qualify your projects such that you have extended time to actually get those credits. But for the next 45 days, I guess the next 40 days or so, that's under review. And so there's a bit more uncertainty on whether the strategies we've used in the past will be applicable to what we're doing going forward. But I'd say that just having sort of the meat of the changes to the IRA understood has given us a lot of comfort and confidence. A little more clarity, but some major questions still to be addressed, sounds like. Yeah. And I'd say just to your other question around opportunities that we're seeing, I think in the U.S. specifically, we've already been very long as a green investment team and as Macquarie generally in green field developments and creating platforms that are developing and creating new assets. I think we're probably still very interested in that and will continue to support our portfolio companies that are doing that. We are also shifting a bit to focus more mature businesses, more operating assets to really complement the existing portfolio that we have. So we're looking at a number of those large IPPs, both public and private. We think there's a dislocation in the public market and the private market on these renewable IPPs. So we're evaluating many of those opportunities and seeing if it makes sense to partner with them and potentially take them private. Very interesting. And Aaron, could you maybe speak to how the changing dynamics of the market and the policy landscape have shifted your focus with regard to the type of opportunities you are pursuing? Not to minimize the role of federal policy, but I really think the biggest change in the U.S. investment landscape for energy in, call it the last two years, has been the resurgence of demand for energy and in particular electricity, which is in part a function of the dramatic growth in the data center industry and in part the trends in electrification that we had seen growing for a long time. That has translated into a huge amount of capital that needs to go into the ground to support it, whether it be pipelines, gas-fired power, LNG exports to take cheap U.S. energy internationally, investments in utility infrastructure to support all of that. It's really a generational opportunity at the moment. So identifying investment opportunities that are emerging from that, and as you can see from the examples I gave, there are a lot of them, is probably the top of our list. On the policy side, the federal policy has certainly made some sectors easier to invest in and others more difficult. I think state policy doesn't get quite the focus, but particularly in power, it's really important. One of our large utility investments, for instance, is an electric utility in Washington, Puget Sound Energy. That's got a legal mandate from the state of Washington to decarbonize the electricity sector. So loss of federal support will make that a little more expensive to do, and we've got to work hard to make sure that the impact on ratepayers is mitigated. But we spend a lot of time looking at how we build new renewable generation to achieve that in Washington. That state law pre-existed the IRA. We don't expect it's going to change with the IRA going away. So that remains a big focus. And to your point, at Infralogic, one thing that we are hearing over and over again is that demand is going to be in the driver's seat with regard to energy for at least the rest of the decade, perhaps longer. Whoever can deliver electrons to the data centers, other hyperscalers, and the utilities is going to be in a pretty good position. But at the same time, it does sound like uncertainty over the policy landscape. How are supply chains going to be able to meet the demand for development in the U.S.? The differences between those state policies, the fact that those may represent some moving targets as well. Those all create uncertainty and challenges for the investment in the near term, regardless of what technology you're pursuing. I'm curious, does that type of dynamic change the way you weigh the risks over time for different opportunities? The demand opportunity creates a lot of incentive for people to come up with creative solutions. While it creates novel problems, I think we've got a lot of confidence that they will eventually be solved. To your question about changing policy specifically, yes, certainly. Infrastructure investment as an asset class is supposed to deliver our investors a relatively low risk exposure. Overriding capital-intensive projects that don't have a high degree of certainty around their revenue streams is difficult, and when there are policy changes that threaten the certainty of those revenue streams, then clearly it makes it harder to finance new assets. I think that that theme really only applies to a small minority of assets in the scheme of things. If you look at all of the asset classes I mentioned before, whether it's LNG, whether it's utility CAPEX, whether it's pipelines, whether it's a lot of the renewable sectors that Will's focused on, the underlying demand will create certainty of revenue that will ultimately get those projects built. We generally have a pretty high degree of confidence in the investment landscape. I would agree with all that Aaron has said. I think when we talk about the growth in demand, I think most of the listeners here will be familiar with the stat that demand in the U.S., low growth in the U.S. for the last 20 or 30 years has been stagnant, but now we're projecting 2%, 3%, 4% per year over the next few decades, which is coming obviously from not just AI and data centers, but also the electrification of the industrial sector and electrification of everything, really. That trend has really come through only in the last year or two. The way that we underwrite, many of the investments that we underwrote before a year or two ago, we did not assume this type of growth. In fact, a lot of those investments look in the money right now based on that demand growth. I think going forward, acknowledging that there's maybe more growth opportunity than in the past, we'll continue to be quite conservative in our assumptions on the growth of the market, even though we know there's a meaningful upside if things continue to grow at the pace it currently is. It's about being a good investor, being a smart investor, and not investing into the trend, but investing into what your mandate is and a reasonable underwriting case. I think that's really important to remember, even in this hyper-growth world, good investors shouldn't be assuming that's definitely going to happen. That's true on both the power side as well as the other side of our strategy, which is the decarbonization of the industrial sector. We believe that there still is, from a demand side, there's strong demand still from corporates and utilities to get clean products. We don't assume they're willing to pay more for it, and fortunately, the sectors we're investing in, we don't assume that someone's going to pay more for an electron because it's clean or someone's going to pay more for a renewable fuel because it's clean. We still see that demand, and so we continue to believe that the investments we've made and will make are investing into growing sectors that will continue to offer market opportunity. Chuck, you started the question by talking about data centers and the demand coming from that. We have the good fortune to be one of the large global investors in hyperscale data centers as well. Will and I have a lot of opportunity to collaborate with our partners and portfolio companies in that space. What we're seeing there is a customer set where the capital needs of the data centers themselves dwarf even the very large costs of providing energy to those data centers. So the hyperscalers are incredibly savvy customers. They need to be served well, they need to be given cost competitive products, but at the same time, the value of their product means that there is a lot of ability to fund creative solutions to energy supply. It's certainly changing the way utilities have to think about it. Utilities have to be a lot more nimble in evolving their business model, but certainly the ones that we work closely with, deploying huge amounts of resources to go through that evolution and make sure that they can capture that market front. We see some of these massive data centers continue to develop and come online. Do you expect to see more repetition or more repeatable approaches to delivering power to these massive data centers, or is it going to continue to be more of a bespoke solution for each of these projects? I'd kick off. I think we're still figuring it out. Number one, I don't have a very clear response for you, but the amount of opportunity that there is, you'd hope that over some time there would be some strategies that are developed to make that process more efficient. Obviously power is the biggest constraint for a new data center development and construction. Our grid is not in a great shape. There's massive ambitions from the hyperscalers to build a lot of data centers. I think we need to take that with a bit of grain of salt. Not that they do want to build a lot of data centers, but without power, they won't be able to do it. There's got to be an intersection between the business strategies of the data centers and hyperscalers, as well as the power providers. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate. As Aaron said, we have a very large data center investment. We have many investments, but one of our largest ones is a company called Align Data Centers. We brainstorm, we collaborate with them to figure out how we can solve each other's issues. There's already collaboration in the sector. I hope that from that, something emerges that is less bespoke and more rinse, wash and repeat. I haven't seen that come together yet, but I don't know if Aaron has a different experience. That industry has been moving so quickly and growing at an exponential rate. The innovative solutions that people came up with six months ago are outdated already. The overriding trend is towards scale, I think, and having solutions which are able to deliver new capacity to these customers at large scale are probably the models that are going to continue to get built on. It's kind of an ever-evolving thing. Yeah, that's right. Just going back to the broader trend towards demand growth, really kind of driving activity in the sector, we've heard much more enthusiasm going back into the gas value chain over the past six months or a year. I'm curious, Aaron, if you might want to start off speaking about where you see the strongest opportunities. You named some subsectors where you guys are interested in within sort of the near to medium term, whether midstream, generation, more towards the LNG value chain. What sort of balance do you look to strike and where do you see the greatest opportunities? Part of the context for gas investment, I think, has got to be what's happened with
