Hello, and welcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. I'm InfraLogic's Managing Editor for the Americas, Jonathan Carmody. And today we have Edward Tsai, Managing Director and Head of Real Assets and Infrastructure at Wafura. Wafura is an asset manager focused on the infrastructure sector, and it invests on behalf of its majority owner, the Public Institution for Social Security. Edward, pleasure to have you on the podcast today. Jonathan, it's a pleasure to be here. Really appreciate you having me on. Edward, can we start with a brief overview of who Wafura is and how you operate within the infrastructure space? Absolutely. So Wafura is a New York-based alternative asset management firm. We've been around since 1985. We're actually celebrating our 40th anniversary this year, and we're active primarily across three main verticals. That's GP stakes, infrastructure, which I lead, and then real estate. And then within the infrastructure business, the way we really think of ourselves is we're focused on investing in value-add opportunities in the middle market. And the way we think about that, to be value-add, it's really opportunities to have sponsor-led value creation. So whether that's in putting together a business from the ground up and scaling it or leading operational improvements or M&A, whatever that is, that's really the angle that we're looking for. And, you know, against the backdrop in the infrastructure space of increasingly larger funds and larger deals, we continue to see a lot of value in the middle market. You know, we think deals are a bit less competed in that space. The market is somewhat less efficient, and we think there's an opportunity to create attractive entry points. And then if you're successful in scaling those businesses, you have a lot more optionality at exit to a broader buyer universe. And the way we think about a lot of that is it's a middle market focus that allows us to underwrite really at a granular asset level. You also have the ability to access platform value creation, drive enterprise value. And that's a key differentiator for us where, you know, a lot of the larger sponsors, you know, they're really not reaching down below 250, 300 million of equity, that really doesn't move the needle for them. And so I think for us, you know, we're doing that work and we see a very active buyer universe to acquire good businesses that can really scale into that part of the ecosystem. So we've been active, you know, really, you know, predominantly in transportation and followed closely by digital infrastructure within kind of the positioning that I described. Excellent. Looking at Wafer's portfolio before this call and knowing your role within the business, Edward, we wanted to talk a lot about transportation assets initially in the first part of the podcast. So recently, Wafer managed to dispose of Global Container International. This is a lesser marine intermodal containers that you've done for several years. You've scaled that business up. That was sold in, I think, March to Triton International, which is backed by Brookfield for about a billion dollars, over a billion dollars as it was reported at the time. Talk a little bit around the thesis that Wafer has for investing in asset leasing businesses as part of its infrastructure strategy. Absolutely. Happy to. And that deal actually was signed in March and it closed a few weeks ago. So very fresh in the memory. We've been quite active across what we think of as all the major food groups within transportation asset leasing. And so that's intermodal, as you just mentioned, it's rail car, it's aviation, all different parts of the aviation lifecycle, it's trailer, it's chassis, maritime assets, and then things like warehouse and industrial equipment. And we kind of think of all that as distributed transportation infrastructure, if you will. We like all those sectors, I think, for a few simple reasons. They're physical assets, they're generally essential use, they're critical to the movement of people and goods around the world, they're generally mature technologies. And that's not just from a technological perspective, but it has the benefit of generally fairly long data sets. And that helps us understand asset value, how do those sectors behave under different marketing conditions, pricing behavior across cycles. That's a benefit as well. And you have other factors like contracted cash flows, assets generally have long economic useful lives, that latter part can be a bit of a double edged sword, if you don't have the technical resources, or you're kind of not holding them maybe in the right investment structures to kind of be able to be resilient across cycles. From the investor perspective, when we think about our investors, that all kind of combines to provide, there's a strong current income component to that, in addition to total return, there's an inflation linkage and adjusted return to ownership of the underlying physical asset itself. And then it creates diversification. I think if you look at infrastructure, more broadly, you know, it's generally less correlated to equities or bonds, and we're seeing an era where those markets, their correlation has actually increased. Those are some of the characteristics that we look for. I think if you look at the reasons I just described, they're all kind of arguments for traditional infrastructure investment. I don't think a lot of those characteristics are necessarily new. The difference that we're seeing really in our part of the space is that we think that there's a difference for a lot of these distributed transportation asset classes. They have some of the same characteristics, but they're just providing better unit economics versus kind of your traditional core or core plus. And then you also have the capacity for growth in a lot of those sectors. So as we think about our portfolio and what we're trying to achieve, if you can create enterprise value on top of those scaled pools of assets and operating businesses, then hopefully you're getting to something that looks more like private equity returns than core infrastructure. You know, one of the buzzwords that's been going around the industry for some time now is resilience. And I'm thinking about how these leasing businesses fit into the infrastructure world. Some of the issues that we've seen globally with regards to supply chain volatility and certain geopolitical risks, how are you adapting to that and how are you adapting your businesses to that? Can you tell us how some of these issues are working out in geopolitics and can you give us any forward looking observations on how that will impact these kinds of infrastructure assets going forward? It's interesting. In the breadth of our activities, I think we actually see a fairly large portion of the supply chain and whether that's cargo kind of that's going into containerized trade, going into air freighters, goods, commodities by rail, truck or barge. And each of those sectors has really reacted differently at different points in time over the last few years. And at a high level, I think what you're seeing is a realignment of priorities when we think about the global supply chain that was really built over decades to prioritize cost efficiency above all their goals. And so that was obviously driven by kind of, you know, global labor arbitrage from developed economies to other regions. And that's created just really vast amounts of physical infrastructure to support and accelerate that process. So it's not just, you know, kind of seaborne or airborne trade. It's all the inland infrastructure that's been built up over decades to handle those increasingly larger volumes of goods and help them move more efficiently. So it's the border infrastructure, it's the inland rail depots, chassis pools, switching yards, you know, you can go on and on, you know, that's all built up so you can service, you know, really massive, ultra-large container vessel, 24,000 TU, taller than the Empire State Building, right? And move that through the system. So now you kind of get to the last five years and more recently, you know, you have other priorities that are coming into focus, right? So that started maybe with the pandemic to some extent, but that's accelerating under US trade policy and then now you have geopolitical concerns. So that's expressed in terms of, you know, you said resiliency, you know, you can say supply chain security, robustness, onshore and nearshore and French shoring, whatever it is, but all of that is like that massive container vessel, it's going to take a lot of time and lots of infrastructure investment to start to effectuate those changes. And then, you know, we think private capital has a huge role in that if you look at government budgets and kind of policies around the world. So that's at a high level, you know, as we start to kind of click down, as we see that supply chain, there is very much, you know, in some senses, a law of unintended consequences. I mean, these are really complex supply chains that have been built up, you know, cost is still going to be the major driver when people make, you know, CapEx decisions. But as these other priorities come more into focus, you know, we think, you know, that efficiency as it starts to not be, you know, the only focus, then the efficiency of the system will require more transportation equipment overall. And so that's something that we think we'll see in medium term in intermodal. It's something we're pursuing actively in the aviation space. So I'll give you an example where some of those complex supply chains have continued to have knock-on effects. So we're invested in a company called Aquila Air Capital. It's a aircraft engine lessor, and our thesis there is really, you know, if you look back on the pandemic and the OEM manufacturing challenges, you know, there are 4,000 fewer commercial passenger planes flying today in the global fleet than would have been the case without the pandemic. And then global passenger demand has exceeded 2019 levels last year. And so that's all created an environment where you have equipment that's flying aircraft that's flying for longer than they otherwise would have. You require more maintenance on older aircraft. At the same time, you have a huge talent drain from MROs and maintenance shops, which is creating a bottleneck for all of that. And so I think that creates a structural demand and undersupply that is going to persist, you know, we think, for a number of years. And Aquila is really at the heart of that where, you know, we have a very experienced management team, very focused on the technical aspects of a very technical industry. And the demand, we think, for spare engines will only continue to increase. What we like about asset classes like that is, you know, we don't have to be against that volatility that you mentioned. We don't have to be 100% prescient about, you know, where exactly that demand is going to arise in every single period. Our assets can be on wing to any number of operators around the world, so long as the economics and jurisdiction and customer credit and things like that make sense. So we can attach to this longer term trend without needing to be millimeter precise on kind of a large fixed asset somewhere. I'm very glad you mentioned that one. There was obviously your most recent investment in the infrastructure space, GCI obviously being the most recent divestment. Aquila, you bought kind of at the end of 2024, as I understand it, and GCI was sold around, as you said, March, between March and June. We've seen in this kind of nine month period, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of upheaval, especially with US trade policy. Did that really affect the negotiations at all in the deal to either acquire Aquila or to sell GCI? Was that a big point of debate and how did you reassure the counterparties in those deals? Was that all based, as you said, on your long term strategy, the long term vision, and you just have to block out the noise and keep driving ahead because you're confident in the direction of travel? It's a great question. I would be taking Intermodal Container and GCI as an example. We launched that process kind of in the late summer of last year and identified where a likely kind of buyer universe was. I would say that the US trade policy noise was probably less of a factor than you might think. And I think that's really the result of kind of a confluence of different factors. Within transportation asset leasing, I think we've seen an increasing amount of sponsor interest and activity in the space. And so that's not just our deal, but it's in the three or four deals before that. When we invested into that company initially in 2018, we saw some of those characteristics that we considered infrastructure and we've kind of seen that play out. And so I think there is a broader, increasing amount of comfort with what are the unit economics in that business? How does that behave? This isn't the first time that there's been disruption to that industry. It's gone through several cycles. And I think that data gave us comfort and I think gives others comfort. So I think that's one factor. I think another is there's a scarcity value in some of these businesses and platforms, especially ones of a certain scale. And so as we look across that industry, when we exited, our business was number six or seven globally, and there really weren't any scale of platforms of lesser, of smaller scale. And so you had a heightened investor interest, you had consolidation, and then you kind of had this longer term thesis of what is going to happen in the next quarter, next few quarters. Is containerized trade going away? What is the demand for equipment? So I think all of those things kind of combined together to mean buyer interest, we think is robust across that because some of the characteristics of transport asset leasing, if you're being disciplined on the way you go about it, are going to be intact for a long time. Aviation is a little bit of a more nuanced story. I'd say, you know, we've been active across all parts of a life cycle. That's one that's been, you know, because of some of those undersupply dynamics that I was describing as a competition for kind of all aircraft, especially new aircraft, mid-life aircraft, you know, we perceive as fairly high. What we like about the engine leasing space within that broader ecosystem is that it's really, it's less of a financial product, you know, you're not interacting necessarily with your customer's CFO office. You're really interacting with kind of the maintenance groups and their prerogatives are really just to keep aircraft in the air. So that operational aspect of it, I think makes it a lot more defensible. It's a lot of work to kind of put together portfolios, very high touch. So we see that particular sub-segment of aviation as one where, you know, you can create outsize return, but you can also kind of grow that business for the next three, five, seven years because some of these production issues are going to take a long time to work out from the OEMs. I want to just touch on one other transportation asset that you've invested in. You launched an FBO joint venture together with Nova Infrastructure for Hawthorne Global Aviation Services, a fixed-based operator with multiple locations in the United States. I'm curious about this one. This has proven to be a very popular asset for infrastructure investors. We look at other platforms out there like Signature Aviation or Atlantic Aviation. It seems like every infrastructure investor admires this kind of asset. They find that there's an attractive, you know, risk-adjusted premium you can extract from a business like this. How has that relationship with Nova worked out? How has that business developed and how much room is there to grow a business like that in your strategy? That's one where the relationship with Nova has been fantastic. I think it's been a close working relationship and it's one where we see a high level of fragmentation still within that industry. It's a platform where, you know, I think we're 14 locations going to the 17 locations. There's just a very high-touch operational aspect to our thesis there, which is it's a business that we liked quite a bit. It was really one that wasn't operated from the standpoint of kind of a, you know, single cohesive vault, right? It was one that was very regionalized, site-specific, and so, you know, didn't have kind of common pricing procurement strategies in place. So it's one where we saw kind of the ability to be value-add as high. So it's kind of doing some of the things that kind of just make sense of unifying the business. It's augmenting the leadership team at the company. And then it's pursuing, you know, bolt-on M&A. So acquired a number of businesses kind of out of the gate, you know, closing on some additional site locations. And as we're putting that together and scaling it, you know, I think there are opportunities because, you know, going back to the theme of platform scarcity, we think that's going to be well-positioned to benefit, not just from kind of investor interests, you know, from kind of the larger sponsors, but sponsors who are, you know, looking to get into the space or have, you know, a thesis of continuing to grow and scale that business. It's one where it's kind of that traditional, I would say, private equity toolkit that we really approached kind of the value-add space and infrastructure with. Our underwriting is always kind of at that asset level, you know, what is this site producing or the economics of this business kind of at a fundamental level? But then I think if you're able to kind of roll up your sleeves and do some of that operational work, do some of the M&A, I think that's where you can kind of access platform and enterprise value. Moving on to a topic that's very close to our hearts here at Infralogic, we're very interested in the blurring lines between real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. Now, within your alternative real asset strategy, how closely do you work with the real estate business and how many opportunities are you finding with that side of the business where, you know, those strategies are converging either in a single deal or a single kind of investment thesis? The way we segment real estate into what we call, and maybe it's just our term, but alternative real estate and traditional real estate. And alternative real estate to us really just means real estate businesses that have a large operational component where you're not just kind of outsourcing the operating aspects of the underlying asset. And in fact, you're kind of, you're driving a lot of the value of the asset in the business by developing and operating it. And we see that as hand in hand in a lot
