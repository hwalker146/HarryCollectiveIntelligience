Hi, I'm Bruno Alves, and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Esther Piner, Global Head of Infrastructure at Swiss private markets firm Partners Group. We cover a broad range of topics, including the recent Iberian blackout and the importance of resilience, how to invest through the current volatility, why managers have to think of a world where LPs need more regular access to liquidity, and how persistent inflation could threaten the asset class's diversification benefits. Hi, Esther, welcome to the podcast. So at the time we're recording this, it's been just over a week since a blackout left over 50 million people in the Iberian Peninsula without electricity. I was actually in Lisbon at the time and spent roughly 11 hours with no power. So this whole topic is still kind of very much front of mind for me. And I feel we need to start there in a way. So as an industry, we've been talking a lot about the need to modernize the grid over the years. So I'll caveat my question to you by saying, we don't yet fully know the causes of the Iberian blackout. But when you learned about the blackout, Esther, did it come as a surprise? Or was it the kind of event that you expected was bound to happen? And now it did? Good question. And actually quite an interesting challenge also for infrastructure in terms of what scenarios do we need to think and operate within? And what's the sort of the size of the tails, right? Because I guess spontaneously, I'd say, what we were looking at the Iberian context, probably in hindsight, the analysis will support that this was a tail end outcome. And the question we now need to ask ourselves, how fat are those tails? And therefore, what's the frequency of risk of this reoccurring? Again, it invites the question of how much from an overall system perspective, is the system prepared and able to spend in order to mitigate or preempt the effects of those blackouts or of a similar blackout, should it be reoccurring? Now, am I surprised to see a blackout? No. My first thought that was triggered when I heard about it really was going back to probably five, six, seven years ago, when we were debating within the team, the question of grid flexibility and grid resilience, which actually ultimately led to our investment decision to build out the Green Neck Interconnector between the UK and Ireland. It was actually a couple of smaller insignificance, but still at the time, pretty significant blackout events that triggered our increased interest in the importance, the relative importance of fast acting relief valves or sort of frequency balancing mechanisms, which ultimately need a connector is in the same way as, for example, a slow spinning gas turbine can be, or even a battery can be synthetically, but really it was a couple of years ago that we were observing a fundamental change in grid architecture ultimately. And I guess on the back of that thematic conviction, not only did we invest in Greenlink, in a number of different cross technology-based energy flexibility platforms across the world, but then also in adjacent infrastructure sectors. So our May cover story on Infrastructure Investor was actually about resilience, funnily enough. You took part in it graciously, and you made a couple of comments that actually caught my eye and that I wanted to discuss further here. One was about data centers, paraphrasing you said something to the effect that they appear to have some of the best contractual provisions when it comes to resilience. And maybe for the benefit of our listeners, what are they doing right? And what do these contracts look like when it comes to risk allocation? So what triggered that conversation was actually another incident that I think was widely reported in the international press, I think also really impacted a lot of people's lives directly. And that was a consequence of the substation fire nearby West London. And it was interesting to see because you look at Heathrow as an energy consumer, and I think it's in the scale of about 30 to 40 megawatts, give or take of energy consumption. And you look at within literally the same system, you have a number of the large data center operators housed with pretty significant load centers. Again, you're looking probably at 5, 10, 15, 20 megawatts of capacity consumption. And it was really, really interesting as the news was unfolding around Heathrow, just watching these two sides of the same trigger event, the data center industry being now so focused on energy and baseload energy, and the sustenance of that baseload energy, observing that that has led to data center resilience planning being a fundamental necessity for large scale data center consumers. And that goes to both double, in some cases, triple redundancies when it comes to grid connections. It goes to onsite backup generation as well. And the industry essentially having standardized that to a very large degree, both in terms of what's required on the asset side, but then also how one prices those resilience layers. It was just very, very interesting to see both of that in play, right? Here's one industry that derives a lot of its value chain directly from the monetization of energy. And on the other side, you have an infrastructure asset, which has the availability of energy as a key input component. Yet the value chain that hangs on the other side of it hasn't either recognized the necessity of that resilience, or potentially, and it goes back to the affordability question, when you look at how the infrastructure is priced, is there room to pay the bill for this fat end? Just to pause on affordability for a second, you make that point now also in the story when it comes to these core regulated assets, a bit grayer, who is going to pay for that and for events that happen every once in a while. And I'm guessing maybe it's a complicated thing to pass that on to rate payers or put the mechanisms in place. Is it just a matter of hyperscalers are deep pocketed in a way that people are not when it comes to rate payers and passing on the cost? If I take a step back and I look at regulated schemes, I think it would be fair to say there's virtually no or very few developed global economies that haven't found a way to get rate payers to subsidize a policy shift on the energy mix. And you can, of course, argue just like that is designed to address a long term risk and a long term significant society cost. In the end, insured and paying the cost of that insurance, if we think about it from a risk transfer way on the security of supply and resilience side, could and should work to the same dynamics, right? Because just like I'm today willing and able as a society to allocate essentially a shift to a renewable energy mix for a consequential reduction in emissions and therefore a limitation of climate change effects to broader society. I think in an equal sort of argument, there should be a case to be made that if we want to ensure the same quality of operational readiness of our infrastructure, you know, in a more volatile world, then that also, again, under the same mechanisms could be passed on to the rate payer. I think what runs against that, and that's also why we see some pushback now, political pushback, individual pushback, individual fatigue on, you know, what is sort of more widely denoted as ESG or wokeness is because we have affordability issues and we have prioritization issues around that affordability. So my main observation would be that it's quite a complex situation where certainly the cost of us being able to operate to the same resilience and reliability levels that we've gotten used to in certainly in Europe and I think to large parts also in North America, you know, undoubtedly that cost is under a lot of pressure now and that's a derivative of more expensive supply chains and it's a derivative of more volatile events around grids and around generation. You know, you've just mentioned volatility and it strikes me that we're again going through one of those moments when there's a lot of volatility in the system. I mean, we have trade wars and tariff talk and all the uncertainty that comes with a particular moment. And so I wanted to ask you, how are you at, you know, Partners Group in general, the infrastructure team in particular, how are you approaching this moment? How is it informing your decision making? I think volatility per se is both a risk and an opportunity on the investment side. We find as we go through again volatile periods and backtestos, on balance, infrastructure portfolios do maintain a much better liquidity profile than, say, a comparable private equity portfolio, no matter whether it's a sort of geopolitically induced or trade induced or indeed COVID-induced volatility. And that's actually a very, very nice feature of infrastructure. And again, I think for me as an industry, we're still quite a young industry, we've probably been as a specific asset class around 20 or 25 years, right? But to now be able to look back on a couple of events and saying actually from a risk downside protection perspective, the continued income generation, the continued cash flow generation of an infrastructure aspect of your portfolio holds up. And I think we would also come out of the volatility with infrastructure being a more significant part of any private investment portfolio. And I would give a positive forward looking, I guess it's either a bet or an ambition, one of the two. But you look at the large part that a real estate allocation would historically have made up of what people would call a model portfolio for a de-risk but still return focused investment strategy. And I do believe we'll see infrastructure content replacing more and more the other real asset content in portfolios. So that per se is a really good starting point. Now I think the second point around volatility is it opens up opportunity. Because in a volatile world, capital allocation changes for reasons that are more decoupled from underlying fundamentals than you have in a less volatile world. I, for example, would point to geopolitical tension. Geopolitical tension also leads to redirection of investment flows. And large shifts from one part to another leave opportunity or some gaps that if you look at the right assets and the right investments, you know, that can actually allow you to invest, build, operate great infrastructure, earn a great return, not necessarily adding significant risk. But for example, you look at generational technologies and you look at the way we started this conversation around how could you potentially address the question of grid resilience? And you know, whether I ultimately take a battery technology to do that, or I take a dispatchable gas technology to do that, that's an affordability question. And in some ways, you can co-locate both, utilizing a grid access infrastructure. And that allows you to play a different set of sort of outcomes, depending by which the broader system says, I value, for example, a significantly lower carbon dispatch. And maybe for that, I need to allow for battery supply chains to again, be more affordable. Because that's, I think, the part on the renewable chain that I think is currently most at risk to be impacted on the tariff side, or, you know, today, actually, the question is more one of dispatchable energy fast, in which case your existing gas infrastructure is going to be getting dispatched more. And then the question is, over time, as maybe the perception of you and the carbon pricing also changes, you still have the optionality to then very quickly scale up with an alternative technology, where you're essentially lowering the CO2 intensity of your energy installation. So it's back to where does the value sit? And what is the scarce commodity? And the scarce commodity, I think, has gone from, I put the next megawatt into the grid to I have the ability to put megawatts into the grid in a flexible fashion, i.e. the grid, the underlying grid connection, I think, today holds a much, much more significant value. And I think if you build optionality in an individual investment, and then you build optionality in the way you put your portfolio together, so that you are diversified across different regulatory environments, across different geographies, and potentially also across different infrastructure sectors, I think you'll be able to navigate this volatile environment quite well, actually. Let me ask you about what this environment obviously kind of makes harder, let's say. For example, I'm thinking, I think I'm right in saying that platform building has long been at the heart of your strategy at Partners Group. And obviously, you know, we've been having supply chain headaches for quite a while. Now there's tariffs and the idea of development becoming costlier. For example, the other day, we spoke to an LP source who told us basically that they were looking nowadays for significant operational capacity among development platforms as sort of an imperative for them to even look at deals. So, you know, is this aspect, I am guessing, has become harder to execute on? But I'm curious how you view it. Is this a momentary thing? And how are you, you know, hedging what's been kind of a core part of your strategy? I think fundamentally, if we stay with energy for a minute, or also consequently with data centers, I think you see some of the same dynamics. There's just such an excess demand that is so intense for the next 12, 18, 24, 36 months that we're finding today. It's less about the impairment of the unit economics, which, you know, would lead to you pausing platform development. In fact, it's more who can navigate supply chains, not for the lowest price, but for the fastest time. And that's different, right? Because everybody ultimately has more or less the same pricing environment when it comes to the supply chain. You can do some optimizations, but it's hardly going to so significantly differentiate you that you can keep that benefit for two, three, four, five years. But speed, timing, execution focus, ability to really plan and execute on a project timeline. There, having done it a few times, working with, again, industry experts, overlaying experience from other projects, other platforms to a new one can help unlock and speed up the bringing of new capacity quite a lot. And that tends to be often in volatile environments, something that's actually thought after, because that allows you to, in a very short ownership period, build up a significant operating business with and still a growth avenue on top of it. And just like you said, actually, we're finding now we had one disposal of such a platform here in Europe late last year. We're actually finding that in a market that's otherwise a little bit less bullish when it comes to valuations, these types of setups right now actually attract an over-proportionate amount of buyer interest, right? So in some ways, I would say you absolutely and always need to have an operating element. But the other thing you absolutely need to ensure now is the operational capabilities and the experience to scale these platforms fast. And if you combine those two, you're ultimately almost manufacturing then that type of content that will continue to attract buyers going forward as well. I have a couple of last questions for you, Esther. One is, I think you've alluded to what could be, again, a good outcome for the asset class out of this period of volatility. But in the current moment, when you're having conversations with your LPs, for example, what are you hearing? Are you hearing about people continuing allocating as they planned? Are people talking about hitting the pause button? I think the infrastructure asset class as a whole has had a tremendous boost when inflation was low and rates were low. And that's led to a proliferation of allocators doubling and tripling down into the asset class. And it's also led to a mushrooming of different strategies, different managers to then collect and deploy that capital. And what we're now seeing in a world where rates are elevated, inflation is significantly elevated, is allocators have less to allocate, period. They therefore, for I think the first time for infrastructure, rather than being net increasing allocations, they're saying, yes, I will make new allocations. But in turn, either I need to see significant distribution that I can recycle because I don't have as much of a growing portfolio or, you know, I'm looking at the universe of managers, the universe of partners I've worked with, and I'm starting to shift. So I think in infrastructure now, there's more of a re-evaluation of portfolios that is ongoing than ever before. Good in some ways, because it opens up different access points to the asset class with more and more secondary volumes coming to the market. But also, I think we'll put continued pressure on GPs to sort of be clear and differentiated on where they play and where they do not play. And then again, I think an increasing bifurcation of track record. Differentiation. And there, I think we're in the very early stages of seeing that play out because in some ways you look at.
