Hi, I'm Bruno Alves, Editor-in-Chief of Infrastructure Investor. In today's episode, I sit down with Madeline Farman, Editor of affiliate title Secondaries Investor and host of the Second Thoughts podcast, as well as America's Editor Zach Bentley, to talk about the infrastructure secondaries market. In our discussion, we track the evolution of the burgeoning infrastructure secondaries market, the asset classes, best in class pricing compared to other private markets, how LP-led deals rule by volume, but GP-led transactions end up being the most sizable, the outsized role of continuation funds in infrastructure, and much more. Hi, Maddie, Zach, welcome to the podcast. Hi, Bruno. Thank you for having me, Bruno. No, I'm very excited, actually, Maddie, because we are talking about secondaries today and infrastructure secondaries in particular, which feels like one of the hot topics of the day across private markets. And we get to have you, who's an actual expert, as opposed to Zach and I, so we can now put you on the spot and gently grill you as much as we can. So thanks very much for agreeing to this. No, thank you for having me. And the secondaries market is certainly keeping us very busy. I often joke, I wish I had five sets of hands, but it's all go, it's all go. So I mean, I think, you know, that's really where we start, isn't it? It feels, especially for those of us of a certain age, and we've been watching secondaries take off year by year, but it really seems we're at this moment of, you know, this incredibly high popularity in the wider secondaries market. So maybe we can start there, Maddie. Maybe you can frame it a bit, what you're seeing just in general in secondaries. Yeah. So if we just take a massive step back, sort of 2017-18, we really saw the emergence of a rebranded technology, continuation funds become the front and center for many managers as a way to elongate their hold of assets. And it was a question that has been asked for a long time. We saw long hold funds in areas like private equity. We saw fund to fund transfers of assets in order to keep hold of them for a longer period. And this technology has just continued to snowball from the sort of larger blue chip managers using them at that time and normalizing this technology to mid market managers, lower mid market managers, all having done their first single asset continuation fund in recent years. What was also interesting is that since COVID, really, we've seen the denominator effect become a pressing issue for many LPs out in the market. What do they want? They want liquidity from their private assets holdings. And so many of them have been coming to market and this continues. I mean, the tariff scenario in the US and elsewhere has only exacerbated this. LPs coming to market to search for liquidity, offload some of their holdings and reinvest back into private markets should they wish to. So it's a really interesting time. There's a lot of activity. And as I sort of say, keeping us on Secondaries Investor very busy at the moment. And so you're seeing essentially two sets of, you know, broadly speaking of demand levers, right? So there's the LP liquidity angle, very much of its time now. And then there's a continuation fund angle, which I guess is a bit of a GP led play, isn't it? So you're just seeing these levers getting pulled across the LPGP nexus. Absolutely. And given that LPs are looking for liquidity, managers are looking for ways to exit their assets. So a normalized continuation fund technology, whether it be a single asset fund or a multi asset fund, seems pretty attractive to a lot of people right now. Yeah. And actually, I want to deep dive a little bit on continuation funds in just a second, but just wanted to put something in front of you. So at our global summit, which we held in Berlin in March, we had several panels on infrastructure secondaries. And one of them, we heard that about 14 to 15 billion US dollars of infrastructure secondaries deal volume closed last year. And that was out of a potential 40 to 45 billion dollars. So that's like, you know, about a third of deals or something like that. So I'm curious, how does that supply demand mismatch compare with the other asset classes that you see? So I don't know if I can go into specifics necessarily of how much volume is completed versus how much potential activity there was across asset classes in a granular way. But what I can say is that the supply demand mismatch across the secondaries market is quite stark. So one of the common pieces of commentary that we hear on secondaries investor is there's just not enough capital in the secondaries market to meet the demand to sell into the secondaries market. And why is that? This is all of a sudden, to the points that we were just making earlier, a market where there's a huge amount of demand from both LPs and GPs. However, if we take continuation funds, for example, there hasn't been a huge number of exits from these transactions. And so LPs are, you know, considering whether or not they want to back a GP-led vehicle. Obviously some LPs out there definitely do, because we've seen some large fundraisers, but it's not a broad swathe of investors that definitely want to invest. So what does that mean? It means that ultimately, managers and LPs can come to market wanting to do a deal, and they might come out with a deal that is particularly sizable, or on the LP side, a portfolio that is particularly sizable, but they might not necessarily be able to get all of that done in the secondaries market, just because of that supply-demand mismatch that we see across the market, not infrastructure specific. Just to add to that, I was speaking to a large secondaries player recently that's an LP and a lot of GP-led continuation funds, and they were just saying that in some of the more major transactions we'd see in the infrastructure space, you'd find them and a lot of the other blue chip names we'd all know in this market, they'd all be in those continuation funds, because they can only each invest a certain amount in these funds, and you find a kind of who's who in all of them. And still sometimes the GP is struggling to garner all the capital up just because of the supply-demand imbalance and usually the size of the single asset continuation funds. So just to jump to pricing, again, in Berlin we heard that discounts of around 8-10% were kind of emerging as the price for liquidity and infrastructure secondaries. There's this report from Greenhill saying infrastructure secondaries scored the strongest pricing I believe among strategies in 2024, and that was averaging around 94% of net asset value. Yeah, Maddy, if you're in a position to do a bit of a look across asset classes, how does that discount to NAV compare? How does the pricing look like compared to other asset classes? So yes, I've got the same report sitting in front of me, Greenhill obviously putting infrastructure secondaries pricing at 94% of net asset value for funds out in the market last year. It is by far and away the best-priced secondary strategy. Over last year and the course of the last five years or so. It's interesting, I think we look at the next asset class sitting there, private credit is sitting at 89% of NAV and buyouts, the most popular asset class traded in the secondaries market sitting at 87% of NAV. So if we take a look at the Greenhill report and why they say infrastructure funds are pricing so well, they say infrastructure funds continue to be appealing to secondaries buyers due to their combination of stable cash flows, inflation protection and valuation upside potential. So particularly in the market that we see now, obviously those things are going to be incredibly interesting to a secondaries buyer. I think what's interesting is when we look at pricing in the secondaries market, it creates a little bit of a strange dynamic. So if pricing is so good, is that the most interesting strategy where you could be as a secondaries buyer the most competitive compared with your peers? Can you offer the strongest pricing here or is there an interesting area where you could find a discount in the infrastructure secondaries market? So I think there's all sorts of dynamics at play here and I'm sure the secondaries market is trying to filter through where it can be competitive and where it might find sort of off-diary, off-market, interesting transactions where it can really showcase to its investors that it's found a good investment at a discount and their peers will not get a look in whatsoever. I'm sure that's happening. Yeah, I mean Maddie will be quite used to the secondaries industry and the wealth of data that comes out, but just to maybe even slightly more optimism from the recent Campbell Lutyens report, infrastructure trading last year at 96%, buyouts at 94% and then you had sort of venture at 75% and real estate at 73%. And I think not only that, Hamilton put it into a very nice digestible graph where infrastructure's discount has never slipped below 95% according to this report, whereas the other asset classes have sort of much more up and down. So it is this stable portfolio protection role that people are looking for their infrastructure portfolios. It's sort of coming to bear when you look at the secondary market. Yeah. Of course, this is not this simple, but I do wonder if from an LP point of view, Maddie, and you can jump in, if I can get this full price and I need some liquidity, then maybe I go here first to sell some of this stuff because I get my 95%. Of course, the flip side to that is I may not be over allocated or even close to that, in which case I don't want to sell it. But do you think it creates a little bit that temptation because you do seem to get very close to 100% there? We've certainly seen portfolios come to market where people are looking to sell a wide range of different asset classes. Obviously, as you say, Bruno, if you're able to get very compelling pricing on an infrastructure portfolio, that is certainly an area where you might look to divest some of your holdings, right now. I think the other interesting dynamic that we're seeing is selling some infrastructure stakes as part of an overall private markets portfolio could offset some of those discounts that you might see in venture capital, for example. Secondaries buyers are often thinking, right, I'll mix and match with some harder to price, slightly less compelling fund stakes, if you can offer something that's going to be very compelling at the upper end of the market. We can find a sweet spot whereby maybe we can offer an effective price that you're happy to take as the seller. Obviously, that's a very simplified knockdown of how these secondaries buyers look at these transactions, but you'll get the gist from that explanation, I'm sure. I think definitely LPs will be looking at their infrastructure portfolios as part of that overall, what does our portfolio composition look like and how do we reach an attractive price in order for us to green light a sale? But I'd be curious to know what you both are seeing in terms of how infrastructure compares with other asset classes and what LP appetite is for infrastructure right now. Well, not to give too much of a spoiler for our July-August cover, but this is what we're looking at. I think one of the prevailing themes coming out, it is this sort of protection status that I was talking about before, the other asset classes, you might get much higher returns, but have seen a lot more volatility in the past three, four, five years, whereas infrastructure broadly has remained the same. And I think that bears through to what you're talking about here. And just in terms of, we started the podcast by talking about, again, how we're seeing secondaries coming at it from the LP side, from the GP side. And I think I'm right in saying that some asset classes, LP leds, maybe tend to dominate. Some others, it may be slightly different. Maybe Zach, I remember you did a round table on this last year on secondaries, that is infrastructure secondaries. Do we have a sense here of where we fit infrastructures and asset classes? Is it mostly GP leds that dominate? Is it nicely split? Is it LP leds? What have you heard? The understanding that I have from the data that's provided and from speaking to people is that the bulk of the activity is LP led, but sort of where you see the big ticket items is in the GP leds, in those continuation funds. I'd be interested to hear what goes on in these continuation funds outside of infrastructure, but we're usually looking at really high ticket items, sort of some of those large scale data center platforms, or sort of in GIP's case, a couple of times airports, which go for very high transaction costs. Maddy, out of curiosity, what do you hear about infrastructure in terms of this GP LP led balance, but also how does it, again, if possible, compare with other asset classes? Is it more or less all the same in terms of dynamics, or are you seeing different things at play here? I think it's really interesting on the GP led side of the infrastructure secondaries market. I have heard the same things as Zach, obviously, the LP led market in terms of the amount of deal flow that we see, and the numbers of deals getting done is sort of surpassing the GP led side of the market. However, the GP led side of the market, while the number of deals is fewer, these transactions are very sizable. And I think, ultimately, it comes down to the fact that, obviously, as you both will know very, very well, the underlying assets that are part of these GP led transactions are sizable in and of themselves. To the point that I made earlier, there is a supply, demand, and balance problem. There's only so much capital available to invest in infrastructure secondaries. But in terms of the art of the possible as to how large these get, this infrastructure secondaries market is an area that we look at intensely to see how large are these deals, what types of structures they're using, and what demand is like, both from the secondary side as well as investors into, and the GPs themselves in the infrastructure secondaries market. Yeah. I definitely think continuation funds are one of the more interesting technologies to have emerged. And I think they will play an outsized role in infrastructure when it comes to GP leds, if only on size alone. Okay, I need to get one thing out of the way. This is maybe an old perception. Let's put it that way. But I'm sure you both will remember that when these first vehicles emerged, the perception was that they served as a bit of a dumping ground for poorly performing assets. I'm guessing that perception has left the building or not quite? Or is there still a little bit of a cloud hanging on continuation vehicles? Yeah, no, absolutely, Bruno. So I think, obviously, the genesis of continuation funds was, you know, they were used as the technology was used to restructure zombie funds, essentially. So funds that were hobbling along in their life, LPs wanted their money out, the manager wasn't able to raise a new fund, and there was essentially stranded assets. The continuation fund technology was essentially a rebrand of that. So a number of high quality blue chip managers raising continuation funds for their star performing jewel in the crown assets. And so I think it's understandable that people still perceive that this technology is or was used for as a dumping ground for assets. But ultimately, what's the check on this? The check is the secondaries market itself. So again, I feel a bit like a broken record, but there is a supply demand imbalance. There's only so much capital that secondaries buyers can invest into deals that come across their desk. And they are going to be looking for the best performing assets, the best deals that they can get done at pricing that is attractive for their funds. And ultimately, that means that these need to be good assets with a good trajectory. These secondaries buyers have their own limited partners, and they're not being mandated to go out and essentially buy rubbish that won't perform well. So the secondaries market acts as the check on whether or not a good performing asset will go into it. And they have their own check there, the limited partners who want to see returns on their investments when they hand over checks to these buyers. So are there, will there be some continuation funds that don't perform well? Absolutely. But they have been underwritten to a high standard and those secondaries buyers will be expecting good returns. Yeah, and hopefully that really functions as a check. I would say anecdotally, I think just LPs are much more aware of this now than maybe they weren't in the past. And so they're a bit more suspicious when a continuation fund comes to be presented to them. But I think that also the GPs know that this is this is not something that you can just dump anymore that what we see going into.
