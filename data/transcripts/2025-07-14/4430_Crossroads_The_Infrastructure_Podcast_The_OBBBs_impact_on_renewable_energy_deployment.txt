Welcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, senior editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Joining us today is David Reister, a managing partner at Segway Sustainable Infrastructure. David, thank you for joining the podcast. Happy to be here, Andrew. So today we are going to discuss the one big beautiful bill that was signed into law this past weekend. We're recording this on July 9th. Now Segway has done some really good detailed analysis of what the impact of that bill is likely to be both for renewable investment and for deployment. And that's one of the reasons that I was really eager to have David on. But before we get into that, David, can you tell me a little bit about your background in the renewable energy industry? Sure, Andrew. So I have spent most of my career in renewable energy. I had a few years in venture capital in the first five years of my career, but then shifted over in the early days of SunEdison into the solar and broader renewable space. That whole time I've either been bouncing between project finance roles or investment roles on various investment teams. So I'm kind of a token finance guy. But over the years, I've certainly become pretty competent in a lot of the areas of development and build on operating of solar power plants. The group I co-founded at SunEdison was called the Global Special Situations Group, very grandiosely named, and we spun out from there and created an investment firm called GSSG Solar, which was the start of my sort of development capital investment experience. We focused on the Japanese market at a time when there was a very lucrative feed-in tariff there. I've also spent some years running project finance teams, including the project finance team at Cypress Creek, kind of during its heyday. When I left there in 2019, I wanted to bring some of the success we had at GSSG Solar doing development stage investments and bring that into the U.S. and Canadian markets through my whole career. I was always sitting in the spot where people were asking me to find development capital for pre-construction, and it was always the scarcest thing, the sticky gear in the machine. And we figured out how to do it well in Japan, and I wanted to bring that to the U.S. market. That's what Segway is. It's a strategy focused on the pre-NTP phases of a project for solar, wind, storage, and transmission projects. It's a private equity structure. We were founded about four years ago, currently investing out of our second fund. We have about $300 million in assets under management. By design, it kind of has to be that size or smaller because the check sizes tend to be fairly small. So it's a little bit of a stay small and stay very focused sort of strategy. We've got 14 people. Half of them are in San Francisco, half are scattered around. And yeah, we make investments at all stages of development. Sure, sometimes it's just posting a few deposits three months before NTP, but more frequently, it's an earlier stage investment. Sometimes as early as just some smart people with a circle on a map. But in all cases, we partner with a frontline development partner. Sometimes that's just one person. Sometimes it's a bigger shop of 40, 50 people. When you make these early stage investments, it's fairly expensive money. We're prepared to lose all of our money on projects that die, and that does happen. So there aren't that many groups doing this because it's a pretty uncomfortable strategy for a lot of folks that have been underwriting to protecting the downside for their whole career. This is a situation where you're not always going to be able to protect your downside and you need to have a few things that go really well. We sell at NTP or DevComplete somewhere in that zone. And when we sell, the liquidity is sort of shared between us and our frontline development partner. Sometimes that's nothing. Sometimes it's a failure. Sometimes things go really well and we get a 5X. But in the aggregate, of course, one hopes that the fund level returns come up pretty good and so far they have. Expensive money, but developers keep their autonomy. They have aligned capital partners, a pretty useful group of people that want the same And you get a chance to maximize your project value by carrying it deeper into the development cycle. And I think that business model has been generally well received. But of course, the connection to what we're talking about here is that we constantly make decisions about whether to keep projects alive or kill them. And they're very difficult decisions always. And this bill makes it a lot harder. It introduces a number of new variables into figuring out can and should this project carry on further and get more capital support. And that's why we decided to do the analysis because it's one of the things we do every day is figure out what is the risk adjusted return of moving this project along and how do we make those decisions at a portfolio level such that we get good aggregate returns. And it's a tricky part of the job and it's particularly tricky right now. Yeah, absolutely. And obviously, we've seen a lot of people and spoken to a lot of people who are opinionated and have views of what's going to happen with the one big, beautiful bill throughout the process. But very few have put it into numbers and done the type of detailed analysis that I think Segway has. And Segway has really done it every step of the way from the first time something passed out of the House to the Senate bill. So we've been able to see how the potential impact changes as there are changes to the bill. So looking now, now that we have a final bill that's been signed, can you give a little bit of a synopsis about how you think what we ended up with is likely to impact the industry? Of course, it's still a slightly moving target because we're all taking educated guesses at what this executive order means for the ultimate treasury guidance. But the battle to get this bill to limit the damage as much as possible was very focused on having a start of construction standard with a long enough window to allow folks to, in an organized and diligent fashion, decide which projects sort of deserved and warranted the investment necessary to safe harbor the projects to get the 30% ITC. The start of construction standard offers a little bit more flexibility than just a hard placed in service cliff on the back end, which would of course make construction financing very difficult because there's just this binary risk, the sort of Damocles kind of hanging out there for you. With the start of construction standard, you probably end up having a longer window as far as when projects are actually finished, whether or not they still get the ITC or not. And that was really the main focus together with keeping transferability in the mix because transferability has proven really healthy for the market. And then of course, getting storage carved out, which somewhere along the way, we realized that it didn't quite have the same stigmas on it as solar and wind had it. And there was a pathway to get it kind of carved out from all this. So it's a very weird place to be, to be demonized in this fashion as a sector. And we're all sort of licking our wounds because just say some very big punches were just landed and it looks like they're not quite done. When you quantify it, what would we say are the headline numbers in terms of what impact this bill is going to have two years from now, five years from now, how much less renewables is going to end up on the grid and how many less dollars are going to go into the sector based on what we know now? Yeah, I think so. Our estimate on the last, on the bill that was passed is that they're relative to status quo and our status quo line is complicated because it includes sort of a pretty healthy dose of projects that are currently in the queue dying of natural causes as we call them, which is to say not from an exogenous policy event like this, but just, you know, dying because they can't get a permit or dying because the interconnection costs are too expensive or dying because you can't find somebody to pay for the electricity. Those are sort of natural causes of death and those establish our status quo line, which over the next five years, that status quo line has a little over 500 gigawatts being placed in service in the U.S. market. Our final analysis of the bill had a little less than 100 gigawatts of that being canceled. Those lines were worse. We've put out some graphs that kind of show in the different versions of the bill, how it moved around. This is the second best of all the different versions put out was this last bill, but it's still an awful lot of capacity that's killed. It's 141 billion of canceled investment. A lot of the storage that's carved out from this is going to become less interesting, which is something that we have not quite quantified in there is what, you know, sort of diminishing returns on storage. If you have less solar and wind coming on the grid, it's a big deal. It lands in a sort of probably short of a catastrophe spot where at one point we were estimating as much as 240 gigawatts in the house bill. That was our estimate for the canceled power plants would be 245 gigawatts. So relative to that house bill, this is about a third as damaging. And that's mostly due to the start of construction standard that ended up making it into the final bill, which was extremely hard fought. But we'll see. Part of our analysis made a big assumption, right? Which was that the references in the bill to old IRS notices about what start of construction actually means, the lawmakers obviously intended for this bill to pick up that same very well established standard. And we now have an executive order out that is explicitly saying they don't want that standard to be applied. And there are versions of how this plays out from here, where our estimate of a little under a hundred gigawatts being canceled ends up being way too optimistic because the start of construction standard won't really mean anything if they change the definition of that in a very severe way. That's interesting. And obviously that's kind of a new development. I think even a new development since your latest analysis came out, correct? Correct. Going back to the analysis though, when you look at the, let's say lost gigawatts that are expected, what are the main drivers of that? What are the clauses or law changes that are going to be most damaging? So the right way to think about this, and it gets a little bit nuanced, something a lot of people said to me over the last six weeks is if there's all this demand out there, which is what you're telling me is true, and that's why we can't pass this bill that cuts off a lot of capacity. There's all this demand that needs to be served. And you're telling me that wind and solar are from an LCOE standpoint, the cheapest and quickest way to get power available to off-takers on the grid, such as a data center. Then what's the problem? Why don't you just accept the end of the subsidy? If your product is that good and there's all this demand, what's the problem? And the problem is of a sequencing nature. That point is well taken. And I think in the long term, correct. In the longterm sort of equilibrium, maybe eight to 10 years out, something like that, we don't need a subsidy and competing on a level playing field with all other forms of power, there will be many, many applications and places in America where solar and wind installations will play a huge role, usually coupled with storage. The problem is what happens on the way there and how much we fall behind in all of the sectors that require a lot of power. And the sequencing problem I'm talking about is this. At the time that you need to decide to put more money into a project, you've got a $2 million need or a $10 million posting, right? You have to look into the future and assess the probability that the project ends up having value margin in it. How far out you think that's going to be and what that value creation looks like, right? The probability of a win and what the win looks like and when it arrives. At the time that we are asked to make a lot of these big investment decisions in projects that are impacted by the bill, we won't know certain things like how quickly is the demand side of the market going to understand that they need to absorb higher prices because supply is going down and the cost of that supply is going up. Will they understand that immediately? Some will. Some of the data center developers understand exactly what's happening and they're saying, I'll sign the new price. I need the power. But a lot of the offtakers of electricity are regulated or stubborn or less sophisticated and they don't know what price they should renegotiate it to. And therefore you don't know if you have a project that's worth anything, right? So if you have a project right now in 2030, and this is true for us in 10 or so cases, we got a PPA for a project that's meant to place in service in 2030 and somebody, you know, the offtaker comes to us or the utility that's doing the interconnection comes to us and says, okay, you got to post $30 million of deposits across these two projects. A lot of it's going to be at risk. So you have to come up with the money and you have to expose it to possibility of losing it if you don't finish the project. But the PPAs that we won were set to prices from four months ago that assumed a 30% ITC would be in place. Now in the end, does that offtaker need the power enough to behave rationally and renegotiate the price that's in the PPA? Maybe, probably in a lot of cases, yes, but we won't know that in that example and many others, we won't know the answer to that until well after the time that we have to invest a significant amount of money into the project to keep it alive. And that sort of timing sequencing problem in the end, yes, we probably end up fine in most cases, but which ones are the most that work out and which ones are the ones where you can't find a agreeable price for electricity with an offtaker? We don't know which are which, and you can't just take a leap off of a cliff with that saying, ah, it'll work out in the end with some of these check sizes. amounts of money that completely rely upon, in the end, an offtaker paying 25, 30% more than they were paying before for the electricity. And you just don't know if and when the answer to that will be, yes, they're ready. And so a lot of products will die. You have to be a responsible fiduciary. Doing that is gambling. It's not investing, right? I can't put that amount of capital exposed to something I have absolutely no control over that won't reveal itself for a couple of years. So David, just to a little bit flesh out the other side of that discussion, the argument is that because of data centers, AI, there's a growing need for power. And other than renewables, when you look at the next five years, there's just nothing that's going to be ready. So at the end of the day, these offtakers need that power, and they're not going to be able to use other sources. Electricity is not ready. Coal is not realistic. And gas turbines, the components are not going to be available until 2029, 2030 at the earliest. So at the end of the day, they're going to need that power. And whatever the economics pencil out at, that's what they're going to pay. So what you're saying is that it'll take more time for that equilibrium to be reached than it will to the time you have to make those decisions. Am I summarizing that accurately? Yes, that's right. I think that equilibrium or proof of that theory will arrive with time slowly, and it's not going to be true in every instance, right? And that sort of equilibrium of they need the power, and you're the only ones that can build it in this next five year window, therefore, this has to work out. It sounds right. It is right in a microeconomics 201 class, but in practice, supply doesn't always meet demand at the local level perfectly, right? We may have developed a project thinking could be a data center offtaker, but this utility will probably want it. It's not always developed directly to the sort of demand that is likely to hell or high water their way to saying yes to a new price. To what extent exactly that hypothesis is true, which is that they'll have no other choice but to pay whatever they need to pay for this electricity. While we wait for that to prove itself out or come into focus, a lot of investment decisions have to be made that are very hard to responsibly make if you don't know which of those projects are going to clear in this sort of new market. It might be that half of our projects in the end, there is an offtaker that says, well, I don't want to pay this much more, but I have to. Which half is it? We don't know. It's very hard to know at this point when you've got a project that's going to place in service in four years. So you end up just kind of shrugging your shoulders and saying, I don't control this outcome. It's going to work out a lot of the time, but not all the time. What do I do with that? So maybe a rough parallel. It was a little bit of a different situation. But a few years ago, we had basically a slew of PPAs that had been reached at a certain price with the assumption that costs would keep coming down. And then you had some of the supply chain issues. You had inflation, and it became clear that the projects just could not be built economically at those PPA prices. And you saw a lot of renegotiations. How is this different? And are there ways that this is similar than that? If anything, you have kind of this one big event that might be easier to predict in some ways, right? Yeah, I think that comp from 2021 is a good one. It's the best one we have. That experience, I think, surprised a lot of developers and investors in portfolios and projects.
