Europe's zonal pricing conundrum\n**Episode ID:** 5102\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-05 08:41:57.907931\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Energy Evolution, an energy transition-focused podcast brought to you by S&P Global Commodity Insights. I'm your host, Ekalavya Gupte, and this week we're looking at the ongoing debate around Europe's power markets, specifically the way in which price zones are divided. Now, zonal power pricing is where regions are split up into several different price zones, and this is to help incentivize more generation closer to demand hubs and relieve grid congestion. As the energy transition progresses, the geographic location of power generation is also changing. Think more wind in more remote locations, and less coal, gas, and in some cases even nuclear in places near demand centers. Now, this is especially relevant in markets with only one price zone, such as Germany and the UK. And this evolution is starting to raise questions about grid bottlenecks, redispatch costs, and incentives for new renewables. I'm joined by our correspondent, Camilla Naschert, to get into the issue. Hello, Camilla. Hi, Ekalavya. So, under zonal pricing, areas with high renewables generation and low demand tend to see lower prices. Now, why is this so controversial? Yeah, take Germany, for example, a large industrial nation with shores on the North and Baltic Sea. Factories and population centers instead are clustered in the South and the West of the country, while tens of gigawatts of new offshore wind are planned in the North. This is already causing grid congestion, this issue of how to move cheap power from one end of the country to another. And now the question becomes, should there be separate market areas to reflect those very different demand and supply balances? Proponents would argue that it would make trading more efficient and, in the longer term, attract factories to the North and incentivize the construction of renewables like onshore wind or solar in the South. Now, aside from domestic efficiencies, the decision of whether or not to split Germany into zones affects other markets as well. So, Germany's northern neighbor, Sweden, has been pushing for a split to Germany's power price zones to help reduce the price pressure on its southern market zone. And that's because the theoretical northern German price zone with lots of wind in the system is expected to be cheaper. In reality, it's not all so straightforward. In late April, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity came out with a long-awaited review of Europe's power price zones with the goal of improving economic efficiencies and cross-zonal trading opportunities. This review was ordered by the EU. And for Germany, the review recommended splitting the country into five bidding zones to address grid bottlenecks and reduce redispatch costs. And they found potential annual economic benefit of up to 339 million euros. Germany now has about three months to decide whether to implement the proposed changes or to develop a national action plan to address grid congestion in other ways. And despite the recommendation, this is far from a done deal. For one, German TSOs have expressed strong reservations. They are citing practical challenges and potential risks. And other stakeholders are arguing that a split could negatively impact market liquidity and just introduce new complexities. Now, the final decision will involve balancing the potential economic benefits and the practical challenges of implementing a bidding zone split. Politics should very much not be underestimated here either. Higher prices in the South and West are seen to be a further hit to German industry, which is already struggling given global competition. And Germany's new government, made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, has said it does not want a bidding zone separation. So, for an indication about how this could play out, let's take a look at the UK. It's not an EU member, so it was outside of this review. But it held its own consultation on a price zone split recently. And to explain this, let's bring in Alex Blackburn, senior reporter here in the European Energy News team. Hi, Alex. Hi, Camilla. Now, the UK, as Eklavvya said, like Germany, has only one price zone. Can you describe the demand and supply picture in the UK and how that's changing? Yes, so very similar to what you were just describing in Germany. In Britain, there's a disparity in supply and demand. So, regions like Scotland and the north of England have a high concentration of renewables generation, particularly wind, but often experience lower demand. Whereas the south, particularly London, has high demand but less generation capacity from renewables. And then the other element to just add into the mix is the transmission grid. So, in simplistic terms, when it's particularly windy in Scotland, there isn't often enough capacity to transport that wind power where it's needed. So, wind farms are paid to switch off. That's known as curtailment in the industry. And typically, it's gas-fired generation in the south, so nearer to the demand, that is then paid to turn on in place of those wind farms. And these are called balancing costs in the UK. It amounted to 2.7 billion of such costs in 2024, and that could more than triple by 2030 if infrastructure issues aren't addressed. Now, under a zonal power pricing system, which is what the UK has just rejected, the theory is that areas with high renewables generation but low demand, like Scotland, would benefit from lower bills and, as such, balancing costs would also be lower. And you already gave away the fact that, in fact, the decision was a no. But there was, as I said, a review of the bidding zone split. Can you walk us through what exactly was proposed and what the arguments were for and against? Sure. So it was definitely one of the most polarizing, divisive debates that at least I've come across in the UK energy industry in recent times. And at certain points during the last three years, it got into pretty ferocious territory when, at conferences, you have people from different sides of the debate going quite strongly against each other. As mentioned, this has been going on for three years. This all started with the previous Conservative government, which launched the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements, or REMA, in 2022, with a proposal to split Britain up into around a dozen different price zones. And it really has divided the industry. On the one side, you have the proponents, such as Britain's largest retail energy supplier, Octopus. They argued that it would lead to a more efficient electricity system. It would lead to lower consumer bills. And as mentioned, it would reduce curtailment costs by better aligning the generation with demand. They believe that creating multiple price zones would encourage large energy users to relocate or even invest in areas with high renewables generation but low demand. But it's fair to say that Octopus and its allies were very much outnumbered. We saw significant pushback from major utilities, trade associations, industrial energy consumers, all of whom have warned that such a fundamental change would create too much uncertainty, would stifle investment, all at a critical time for the energy transition. Let's not forget, we're only five years away from 2030, when the UK government wants to have a power system that is 95% low carbon. The many critics, so that includes SSE, Centrica, Scottish Power, they argued that the risks associated with a zonal system, such as creating a so-called postcode lottery for consumers, outweighed the theoretical benefits. They emphasized that the existing national pricing system, while potentially imperfect, provides the stability needed for continued investment in the clean energy system. In the end, as we have talked about, the government sided with the utilities and decided not to go ahead with the proposals. And I think at this point, it was summarized quite nicely by analysts here at S&P Global Commodity Insights, who said in a trade-off between investment security and economic efficiency, the government has seemingly opted for the former. That's really interesting, and I mean, terms like a postcode lottery make me think of almost a political debate as well. I wonder if this is the kind of issue that would actually resonate with voters. Do you think that the British voter had thoughts on this one way or another, and that played into the decision? I think if you look at the surveys and the polling that has been done on the topic, Renewable UK, one of the UK trade associations, did a survey earlier this year that found 58% of people in England and Wales are against zonal pricing. There's other surveys that would give you a bigger percentage of people who are against it. I think what is a question mark is that although, as mentioned, this has been a very polarizing debate in the industry, I'm not sure the same can be said for the average voter. I'm also not sure how closely understood the complexities of the energy system is understood or resonates with the average voter, and I think this is one of the other main arguments that the utilities have had. Centrica CEO Chris O'Shea was asked about this on an earnings call last week. For context, Centrica owns British Gas, which was the UK's largest retail energy supplier until Octopus overtook it early this year. Beyond the arguments for zonal pricing being bad for investment, O'Shea's point was that it is also bad for customers because of simply how complex a system it would create. At the moment, electricity prices in the wholesale market change every 30 minutes, and under a zonal system, that could be every five minutes, and prices would also differ from zone to zone. So there's a possibility that you'd have a different price to your neighbor, and it's just an extremely complex proposition to communicate efficiently, and that was O'Shea's point, is that that complexity is not good for customers. Yeah, I see. Now, this proposal was ultimately rejected, but of course, many of the problems, many of the reasons that proponents have been raising, they still remain. So is this the end of the story? It's definitely not the end of the story. After rejecting zonal pricing, the government has pledged to reform the existing national power pricing system. Now, I think there are legitimate questions around what that will look like, and it remains to be seen whether that reform can deliver efficient price signals to encourage renewables investment in the right areas. The government intends to publish a delivery plan for that later this year. It also, as part of REMA, is committing to a raft of other reforms, so that includes a strategic spatial energy plan, which will map out energy infrastructure projects through 2050, and it will also look to review so-called TANUOS charges. That stands for Transmission Network Use of System Charges. It's basically the fees that suppliers and generators pay to use the grid network. So in more remote locations like Scotland, those charges are higher. So they're looking at reforming those and bringing it in a more fair system. Then the final piece is an ongoing commitment to upgrade Britain's ageing grid infrastructure, which, going back to the point about wind in Scotland switching off, that would help cut back some of those curtailments. Thanks, Alex and Camilla. And obviously, this might sound like a technical story, but as you explained it, it has real-life impact on investment decisions, power market design, and as a result, on the pace of the energy transition.

I'm your host, Ekal Lavya Gupte, and in this episode, we will be looking at some of the developments around Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which enables international cooperation to tackle climate change and to unlock financial support for developing countries using carbon markets. We will explore the evolving dynamics of carbon finance, the opportunities for national ownership, and the critical role carbon registries play. This comes as several countries, companies, project developers, and policymakers are getting more active in using Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Now, under Article 6, countries can transfer carbon credits earned from eligible domestic projects to other countries, helping them meet their climate targets. And it has been a remarkable few months for carbon markets, especially following the historic decisions made at COP29 in Baku last November, where key rules and guidelines around Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 were finally agreed upon, paving the way for countries to engage more effectively in carbon trading. In this episode, I am joined by Gurvinder Bans, the Director of Business Development of Environmental Solutions, which is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, and Yu Salve, who is a Senior Director of Market Development and Partnerships, and Gold Standard, which is a key carbon markets and sustainable development standard setter. In this episode, we will unpack the implications of these recent developments and how they have shaped the strategies of countries, registries, and companies navigating carbon markets. The conversation also dwells into the options available for countries looking to access carbon markets, including the Centralised Paris Agreement crediting mechanism, the establishment of national programmes, and the utilisation of independent standards. Now let's head straight into the conversation. Firstly, Yu and Gurvinder, thank you for joining us on the podcast. Great to have you here, especially in the studio. To kick off, obviously, it's been a fairly eventful 2025 in the Article 6 space. And one of the big reasons maybe is, you know, we had a sort of historic decision at COP29 in Baku last year. So maybe to start the scene, can you give us a little bit of colour on how things have progressed or not progressed? Yeah, I mean, it's been a long journey to get to where we are right now. And really, if you look back over the past 10 years since the Paris Agreement was signed, there's essentially been what you could say is three phases of implementation of Article 6. So you had a first phase after the Paris Agreement was adopted, but before you had any of the implementing rules for Article 6, where for about six years, there were really very few countries which were getting ready and starting to implement Article 6. You had Switzerland working with several different countries internationally, but nothing that was really actually being done, no authorisation, some agreements, but no authorisations. We then had the first big breakthrough at Glasgow in 2021, where we had adoption of the first and really the primary set of rules for how Article 6 is adopted. And that really set off a second phase where we started to see much more of a flurry of agreements between different governments globally, the kind of lines of who is connected with who has bilateral agreements with each other, really started to increase. And we started to see some of the first projects being authorised in that period after that as well. And then the Baku decision, which we got last November, has really moved us into a new phase, what you could maybe see as a third phase, where we now have the full rulebook for Article 6. There is no more questions about what comes next, which has really delayed some action over the past few years. We now have the full rulebook. It's not a plan for it to be amended for several years. And we now see governments taking more seriously their adoption, their implementation of Article 6. Around the same time, we had two important things which came in as well. So we had more decisions on which standards can supply credits for Corsia for its first phase. And that really unlocked or kind of started to unlock more supply coming through to meet the demand which we expect under Corsia over the years to come. And we've also now entered a phase where we have Article 6.4. So the new UN crediting mechanism. This is now operational. So this has moved from theory into practice. We have the standards in place. The registry is being looked at. We have methodologies which are being adopted. And so we've moved from a period of maybe four or five years where you didn't really have action under the UN. You had independent standards like us. We're now moving into a period where UN crediting is there alongside the work of independent standards. So this new phase, I think, is an exciting one. Hopefully, it's a long one and we don't see too many fourth and fifth phases. But it feels like we're in a different period right now. Yeah, just to pick up on a couple of things that Hugh said there. I think from our conversations with countries, we're seeing that they're increasingly looking at carbon as a national asset. They're looking to take control of methodologies and economics and the way that they think they can do that is through setting up national programs. And S&P is building the Red Cross Registry for Kenya, which has decided to go down this route. In terms of the kind of authorization process, authorization under Article 6 and Corsair is quite an involved process. It requires insurance. It requires commercial discussions and NDC accounting. And countries need that time to do proper NDC assessment before providing authorization or they risk overselling and not meeting their own NDCs. And that's a really serious concern because if a country oversells, it affects their reputation in the market. In the next round of NDCs, bi-countries will be concerned about that. At the same time, countries have got developers coming to them asking them for letters of authorization and corresponding adjustments. Countries really need to have proper data and tools to support this process, visibility over carbon crediting activities in their countries in order to take these kinds of decisions. Thanks, Gurvinder. Now, we know your team recently released a white paper highlighting the sort of need for effective carbon registries. So can you tell us a little bit about that, please? Yes. So the white paper is really focused on countries and providing some clarity around what a registry does, demystifying some of the jargon and setting out the various options that countries have for accessing the carbon markets and also some of the pros and cons of each of those options as well. And the three options for countries to access the carbon markets are to build a national program to utilize the Paris Agreement crediting mechanism, which offers a centralized standardized approach determined by the UN. It comes with a lot of predictability and credibility. And the third option is to leverage what already exists in the market and has been developed over decades, in the case of some standards, leverage the independent standards that exist in the market. And they have an established relationship, they're understood by buyers and project developers, and they also offer countries a degree of flexibility. And I think the likely outcome is that countries will employ a combination of all three options. And if we think about timing-wise, given that the independent standards are there and up and running, and there's already activity in that space, it would make sense to utilize as much of that as possible. And then when the Paris Agreement crediting mechanism is fully functional, to start utilizing that. And then over time, as the country understands, builds up more knowledge about carbon credits and activities in their jurisdiction, and understands how many transactions they're likely to have a year, think about setting up that national program. Are there any examples of countries using some of the options that you've mentioned? So we have examples already of countries which are looking to do what Govinda's just shared and to adopt different models as they're looking to bring carbon finance into their country. So India right now is setting up a new carbon credit offsetting scheme within the jurisdiction. This is something which they see sitting alongside projects being registered under independent standards like gold standard, maybe under the Paris Agreement crediting mechanism as well. We have Thailand, which for many years has run the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Scheme, which is a national program. But we've been working with Thailand to look at how you can bring some connection between what they are doing and what we are doing as an international standard setter. There are values in having national programs. You can set methodologies which may be more context specific. You can have documentation in the national language. But you don't necessarily have that access to demand, which you may have under international standards. And this goes back to the pros and cons, which I think are set out in the white paper between these different options. Going for a national program brings some advantages for you, but does it give you that access to carbon finance, which you may get under Paris Agreement crediting mechanism or an independent standard? Cool. Thank you. And now, you know, one of the things you mentioned was that we're seeing a bit of a rise in countries wanting to take charge of their carbon markets, you know, maybe carbon nationalism. So if you can tell us a little bit about how different countries are using this as a national asset, as you mentioned, and how that feeds in with the Article 6 infrastructure, especially. Yeah. So I'm not sure I love the phrase carbon nationalism, but I think if you take a step back, what we're seeing now in the carbon market is really a reflection of the objectives that countries had when they set up the Paris Agreement. The whole idea of the Paris Agreement was moving away from a top-down, centralized framework for taking international action to more of a bottom-up approach. There is a collective goal there in the Paris Agreement, but countries get to determine how much they contribute. They get to determine how they contribute to that goal. And that is really feeding through to what we're seeing in carbon markets right now, where while in the past we had the CDM, the Clean Development Mechanism, we had joint implementation, we have these international frameworks. Those are still there, but countries have a lot more optionality in how they use carbon finance to deliver their objectives. And this is what we're seeing right now. We're seeing many countries across the world which are implementing regulations right now, and they don't all look similar to each other. They are taking different approaches which are based around national objectives, based upon national context, and as you said, based around how do I make sure that there are national benefits that come from this, and how do I make sure that we have some control over what is happening with carbon market activities in our jurisdiction. And I think, really, the way that these vary is in part based on how much the country is willing to look at and to work with the international market, and how much they are thinking about international harmonisation, fitting with international standards, and how much they are looking at national standards, national systems, and national ownership. And we're seeing a spectrum across that across the world. Okay, thank you. Now, we know that Gold Standard recently signed a sort of landmark deal with Indonesia. If you can give us a little bit more detail and colour on the process that it took to get there, and also maybe what are some of the big implications, and do you see deals like this being maybe more common? Yeah, so Indonesia is a hugely important country in the context of climate action and carbon market. So, fourth biggest population in the world, ninth biggest emitter of CO2 emissions from energy in the top ten in terms of forest cover globally. And so what Indonesia does on climate action, how it engages with carbon markets really matters for the success of the market. And if you go back to 2021, Indonesia introduced regulations, which really placed a bit of a freeze on carbon crediting on projects under international standards, and brought more of this national ownership around kind of national standard. And we had a period of time where it wasn't very easy to engage with the government to unlock one of the options which was there in the regulations, which was for mutual recognition, so recognition of different standards. And this really changed with the change of administration in Indonesia at the end of last year, in November of last year. Since that time, we've seen a real interest in opening up to international carbon finance, an interest in engaging with us as a standard setter, with other standard setters as well, and looking at how Indonesia can engage with national governments with standard setters to bring carbon finance into the country in a way that provides benefits for NDC delivery for people etc as well. And so gold standard was the first standard setter to sign a mutual recognition agreement with the government of Indonesia in May of this year. This is really the framework that allows gold standard to be recognized within the country, allows the government to give explicit approval for projects under our standard, and allows those projects to deliver positive benefits and to sell their credits, whether to the domestic or international market as it's been approved. So we've taken a lot of steps to work within the system which Indonesia has set up here to make sure that this option of gold standard project development is available in Indonesia, and really to work hand in hand with the government. This is something which needs to support, align with, comply with their regulations and this is what we've been trying to do. Thanks. And one of the big things that we're seeing in carbon markets generally is a sort of massive fragmentation and what you just said feeds well into that. The market that's already fragmented is probably getting even more fragmented or dissected. So what does this actually mean? Yeah, it's a good question. There's a proliferation of programs, right? We've got independent standards and now we've got countries setting up national programs and I think at our last count there are about 60 different standards and they all have different methodologies and data protocols and that's not helpful from a market perspective. What we're hearing from buyers is that it's difficult for them to keep track of these different standards, for them to understand them and more importantly compare them and this really becomes a barrier to entry in the market. I think there's a real danger that buyers become experts in certain programs or regions and just trade those and what you end up with is a small pool of suppliers and a small pool of buyers which means smaller markets overall and then we will struggle to achieve the higher volumes of trading, for example, that we want to see on exchanges and ultimately we're hindering the development of a global carbon market that can deliver the scale of emissions that are needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. There are certainly a large number of programs which exist now and we've really seen a proliferation of this over the past few years. But I think if I was to look at the market for Cornflakes, I'd probably see lots of different providers of Cornflakes as well, but we go to certain ones that we know and we trust and so I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that we are seeing competition when it comes to standard setting, but I think there's two things that matter. One is that we do see some form of standardization and consolidation maybe in some places with that element of competition which is there, but also that we see common standards which apply across our standard sectors and so we are in an era now where there's a kind of real concern I think about us being on a path towards fragmentation, but some of the solutions are there and already with us right now. So if you look at how standards are set, we have the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, which is really trying to make sure that wherever a methodology is developed in line with certain principles and that if you're a buyer in the future, you can trust that if this methodology has this tag, I can trust that this at least meets a certain bar. The concerns that we have for sure is around kind of fragmentation across different registries and where these credits sit and this is really, it's really part of a transition that we have away from a kind of system in the past where you had one closed system, the gold standard registry, the Vero registry, where credits were housed, to a new system where maybe credits sit elsewhere. You have this concept of an ITMO under Article 6, which kind of sits maybe distinctly from a unit and asset as we've known in the past and we do have solutions which can come in and support addressing that, so the S&P Meta Registry is really looking at how do you address that challenge. So some of the solutions are there already in the market to address fragmentation. The question is, do we work together to bring these through and do we rally around some of these solutions to take us to a market which is more harmonised in the future? And there is a lot of work going on the market integrity, the market infrastructure side. There are several key initiatives that are already advancing this agenda. S&P is a member of the World Bank's Carbon Market Infrastructure Group, which is developing a digital infrastructure and registry framework to enable cross-jurisdictional compatibility and the Carbon Data Open Protocol, which is creating a shared data language for carbon assets, improving transparency and reducing friction in data exchange. And these are two really important initiatives because connectivity and interoperability are probably two of the most important things that we need to think about in terms of scaling the global carbon market. And the challenges that we're seeking to solve with the Meta Registry. The Meta Registry will allow participants to exchange data with each other in a secure and automated way. And that then provides the ability for a country to get a jurisdictional view of their crediting activities. It gives them the data that they need to take the decisions that they're expected to take, to be able to track their corresponding adjustments and also to be able to accurately report to the UNFCCC across all programmes in their jurisdiction. So these are some of the solutions that we are working on right now. I think one for the future is, as Hugh alluded to, is how we track credits across independent standard registries, host country registries, buyer registries, and just ensure that credits are tracked and accounted for correctly and accurately. And you know, we've got a few months to COP30 in Brazil later this year, but are there any big trends that you see on the lead up or in the next few months or a year that we might see in, especially related to standard setters and registries and the evolution of these markets? Are we expecting a little bit more momentum then? My hope is that this is a rare year for Article 6 where we're not seeing a big focus on what negotiated outcome will come out of COP30. The big pieces of work have been done already on the Article 6 rulebook. And that's really welcome because it allows the focus to go much more onto implementation. So if you look at the intersessional negotiations which have been taking place in Bonn in June, we've seen there on Article 6 side a focus on capacity building. So we're not looking at negotiations, what words need to be in there to provide clarity in the rulebook. We're looking at how governments can build their capacity to be able to implement what is there. And that really is the hope that we have over this next period. So we have the rulebook in place. We have a lot of bilateral agreements between different governments. We have other governments who are looking to authorise for Corsia. But we haven't seen that many moves to actually provide authorisation statements for projects yet. We have some. But if this market is really going to scale up and to make a material impact and delivering against Paris targets, this is the period really over these next few years where we really need to see more projects being authorised, more action under Article 6 to supply units for Corsia for NDCs as well. So my hope is that all the capacity building work which is happening now and has been happening over the past few years really leads to action in the next six months and beyond. In terms of the registry world, a hot topic at the moment is the ability for financiers such as banks to take a security interest over carbon credits. And this is really key in terms of scaling up finance and funding for projects and increasing that. And there's an important role for registries to play in tracking and supporting that in a legally robust way. In a way it's similar to a bank taking security over a home and they grant a mortgage. This will be significant for channelling funds to project developers and projects. And it's something that we're actively tracking. It feels to me like there's two ways this could go. You could either get this fragmented, disparate market and everybody goes and does their own thing. And that's okay. But actually there's an opportunity here to build a truly global market and at the scale that we need as a planet. And I hope that we can achieve that by working together. You mentioned countries should take a leadership role. Switzerland came to mind because obviously they are probably the ones that are so far least involved in some of the ITMO trades that we've seen. Do you see other countries, especially buying countries, being inspired or recalibrating or rethinking their approaches to Article 6? You have a set of countries who have been signalling for a long time that they are committed to purchasing credits under Article 6. This is an important part of them meeting their national target. Switzerland was the first out of the gate and really did show leadership in how to set up a bilateral agreement. And they're showing some leadership now actually in doing piloting with Norway, Sweden on how to cooperate around carbon dioxide removal credits, which is something we haven't really seen under international markets before outside of the voluntary market. And so there's leadership that they continue to show there. We have buyers in Asia, Japan, Korea, which traditionally have taken quite a kind of specific national approach, may do so again in the future. We've heard from Germany, we've heard from France, we've heard from other countries who are looking at the role that international credits may play for 2040. And why this matters is the size of the market. So if you look at some of the other buyers we have, Singapore, Switzerland, Sweden, the volumes are relatively small that we're talking about there. And they are smaller, for instance, than the Corsica market. But if the EU is looking to purchase under Article 6, the volumes there are much more significant. And that's where you start to see Article 6 scaling up to a level that really may have a material impact on emissions globally. All right, that is all for this episode. We hope you enjoyed it.

Today, we're examining a story that's unfolding in real time across Europe. We will be looking at how heat waves are stress-testing the continent's power infrastructure and fundamentally changing energy demand patterns. From nuclear plants reducing output due to warm river water to a surge in air conditioning demand, Europe's energy markets are truly facing the heat. I'm joined by a correspondent, Kamila Nashad, to bring you this week's episode. Hello, Kamila. Hi, Klavia. So, obviously, extreme weather events like heat waves can have an immediate impact on energy demand and renewable energy output. And we've seen that in various parts of the world. In fact, in 2023, where we had a really hot heat wave in Europe, climate-driven electricity demand was above average, especially in southern Europe, due to cooling required during exceptional summer temperatures. And in Scandinavia, where cooler-than-average temperatures in several months actually led to increased demand for heating. And this warming that we're experiencing is particularly rapid in Europe. Now, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is the European Union's climate monitor, Europe's warming has outpaced the global average by a factor of two since the 1980s. So, can you give us some numbers on this, Kamila? Well, listeners in Europe probably won't be overly surprised to hear that Europe is indeed warming very quickly. Western Europe just experienced its warmest June ever, with an average temperature of 20.49 degrees Celsius. And even England reported its highest temperature for June since records began that was in 1884. And part of the explanation for why Europe is warming faster is actually a reduced air pollution. In the past, pollution aerosols would block some of the solar radiation from reaching the ground. And with that having decreased, temperatures are now rising. Geography also plays into it. Some parts of Europe extend into the Arctic, which is currently the fastest warming region on Earth. And that exacerbates this trend. Yes. And we're already seeing the impact of these temperature anomalies on Europe's energy systems. And we are lucky today to be joined by our first guest, Glenn Rickson, who leads the short-term European power analysis team at S&P Global Commodity Insights. Welcome to the podcast, Glenn. Great to have you here. So to start off, you know, maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how a heat wave or high temperatures, how do they affect power demand and renewable energy output, particularly? Yeah, sure. Happy to help. And yeah, just to talk through, I guess, the basics around temperature sensitivity and weather sensitivity generally in Europe in particular, always there's been some sensitivity to weather conditions in the energy sector in Europe, but that is evolving over time. In winter, typically we are still looking at primarily as far as temperature is concerned, a demand side effect where gas and power demand is higher in times of cold weather, obviously. There are some correlations with temperature around wind generation. So in times of very low temperatures, you do sometimes get a drop in wind speed as well. But when we look at the summer, then there is a balance between demand effects and some supply effects as well. So obviously in the case of demand, when we do get periods of high temperatures, then there is an uplift in cooling demand. And that can vary by region because partly because temperatures vary by region, but also levels of air conditioning can vary as well. And then also in proportionate terms, then some markets have a greater level of non-weather responsive demand if there's lots of heavy industry, for example, compared to in the case of Southern Europe, you get lots of tourism demand in high summer as well, which can be quite sensitive to temperatures and air conditioning effects. But then you also have the supply side of the story as well, and it's partly a temperature story, but also a precipitation story or around water levels as well. So for example, in France, if we take 2022, which was the height of the energy crisis as a case study, we came into 2022 obviously with high gas prices, but also with some quite constrained French nuclear availability. And that situation was worsened as we got into the summer because of high temperatures and low precipitation levels that led to low river levels, which limited French nuclear's ability to generate. And those level situations obviously also impact hydro generation, but they can also impact coal deliveries down the Rhine, raising costs of coal generation as well. So all of these things are coming together to compound the impacts of heat waves on the European power system as a whole. Thank you. And what would you say are some of the big sort of stress points really for energy markets? You touched upon supply, but even from a grid perspective, are there any particular issues that we see more often when we have either higher temperatures or even extreme weather? Yeah. And partly it's a function not only of how high temperatures get, but also the duration of how the periods of heat wave as well. And beyond the things that we've spoken about already, there can be issues with infrastructure. So cables can be subject to failure in very high temperatures. We also see effects on plant efficiency. So if you see a period of sustained high temperatures, then that can affect the efficiency of many types of generation. Thermal generation such as gas and coal can be impacted. We can see impacts on solar PV panels as well. And as mentioned, there are kind of structural effects on hydro generation as well if river levels are affected. But sometimes there are also corollary effects as well. One observation I would say for this summer so far, we're talking in mid-July, is that in June we had record temperatures for some parts of Europe at least, which came a bit earlier than we would normally expect to see in summer. Typically it's July and August are the very kind of periods of very highest temperatures. But although we did see high temperatures, we also actually saw quite high wind generation as well, which is not unprecedented, but it's quite unusual for a summer month, particularly as we had between really the start of last winter and through to April, almost every month was a low wind month relative to history. So coming into May and June, we have seen that pick up. But quite often when we see periods of very high temperatures, we do also see a drop in wind speeds, which can obviously compound the effects on the power system as well. Thank you. And I know your team recently published a sort of heatwave scenario analysis, which sort of looks at the potential impact on power demand and gas-fired generation. So what were some of the big risk factors or what were some of the interesting bits that you identified from the scenario? Yeah, well, one thing I wanted to note actually is every summer is different. So when we spoke a moment ago about summer 22, that was almost an extreme example of tight conditions where beyond the heatwave effects, we saw very elevated gas prices. Because of that tightness in the overall market, significant price uplift. So August 2022 saw the highest ever power prices, and I think gas prices on record, which is for an August, quite unusual, you'd expect that to be a kind of a winter story. Fast forward to three years even, to this summer, and we started this summer in very different conditions where we saw the highest level of negative prices and just a generally much better supply market. So while we have seen in June those record temperatures that I mentioned, we may see them again coming into summer. We are starting at a very different position than the extreme of three years ago. So the generation has obviously been a factor there. We've seen an uplifting capacity, which is well correlated with high temperatures. So while we might see efficiency effects, we do also see higher overall solar output at times of heatwave and high sunlight. So we've run a sensitivity to replicate at least some of the conditions of summer 22 and summer 23 onto the rest of this summer. So that includes things like lift in consumption. We constrained nuclear availability for the July-August period to not quite replicate the conditions of 22 because that was quite extreme, but to at least get us closer to that level. We uplifted coal transport costs. We limited flows from Southeast Europe to Western Europe to reflect hydro pressures, for example. And I would say, to be perfectly honest, the biggest message that we have is that there is the price uplift, but it's within reasonable constraints of what we've seen already happening. So the upside that we see in terms of price is weighted towards the French market relative to, say, the German market or the UK market. And the reason for that primarily is that firstly, France is one of the discount markets in our basic case view because it's relatively well supplied. And at least at this time of year, compared to, say, Spain, which has high temperatures and Germany, which typically would have, say, lower wind yield than it might do in the winter, it's generally in a better place supply-wise. So that weighting is to France. But even then, we see relative to our base case, say, a 12 euro per megawatt hour upside for August, which is kind of like 15, 20% or so relative to our base case view. And the price impacts in other markets are less pronounced. So I think, while I would never rule out the potential for periods of extreme price upside, there's always that potential. Because we are in a relatively well supplied place for this summer, we don't see anything like the same upside that we saw in, say, summer 22 as a potential. Thanks. Very interesting. And obviously, one of the things we're seeing from a demand perspective is this climate-driven electricity demand due to cooling is really sort of picking up the need for air conditioning, more and more air conditionings across Europe and this part of the world. So how do you see that sort of playing out? Yeah, we do see the uplift from cooling demand, I think very broadly, and it does vary across market and time of year. But once we get to, say, country averages of 20, 22 degrees, then we start to see an uplift on cooling demand. And obviously, that has a certain daily shape to it, which can mean that you see significant moves in intraday shape in Spain, for example, where you have very high solar in the daytime, but that tails off once it gets dark in the evening. Then we do see potentially quite a steep uplift in net consumption because of the still high air conditioning demand, but the drop off in solar. And over time, then things like data centers are going to become increasingly relevant for data centers. Already, we see when data centers are looking where to locate. There is a drive towards investing in the Nordic markets, for example, and the relative coolness of the Nordic markets is a key part of that decision-making process. So we might see that emerge further as heat waves potentially continue. And then if they are installed in a particular market, then it does uplift the potential for cooling demand and also sensitivity to water levels as well, if we see greater offtakes of water during times of high temperatures from data centers. And can you tell us a little bit about how infrastructure is affected or can be affected by higher temperatures? Yeah, I'll certainly try at a basic level. So we have already this summer seen a number of infrastructure issues. So Spain in April being the most obvious one where we saw a nationwide blackout, I should say that wasn't directly as a result of high temperatures. But certainly there is, I guess, increased frequency and anecdotally at least increased frequency around power outages that's certainly getting more attention. We've seen outages in, I think in Prague recently and the Southeast Europe as well over the summer to date. None of these are necessarily tied exclusively to heat wave effects, but I would say there is broadly a greater potential for issues when we see more and more decentralized generation coming on stream, which can make it hard for network operators to manage demand upside because it's quite hard to determine what's real demand versus what's behind the meter behaviors. There is an effect potentially on cabling infrastructure and I'm no engineer, but certainly the higher the temperatures that we get to once we get past a certain threshold, then we do see greater risk of equipment failure, whether it's cables or other kinds of transmission infrastructure. And what I would say is it's all about the correlation of these things as well. So we've spoken individually about all these different elements, but across technologies and across geographies, then if all these things compound together, then overall we see greater risk around more wide scale issues, if not around power outages, then at least very elevated prices. And we do see still very elevated prices at times of high temperatures for sure. Okay. Thank you very much. And before we close off, is there anything else I've missed out on or any other bits that you think are quite useful from a sort of power and energy perspective? Well taking all of these things together, in terms of investment for the future, I suppose it's worth keeping in mind that certainly there has been an increased frequency of heatwaves in the last few years, June saw record temperatures for the time of year in a number of markets. So it's probably wise to assume that these conditions continue and potentially accelerate as well. So certainly any kind of investors are going to be looking at how they mitigate against that. We did a study this summer with solar developers looking at a collapse in the value of their assets when we saw kind of a high rate of negative prices. But the flip side to that is at times of heatwave, there is at least potential to earn greater revenue and to serve the power sector because of that correlation between temperature and sunlight basically. So there is a mixed story there. And certainly as a general point, I would say is that the ability to flex demand is already valuable and will be increasingly of value. And that includes the ability to mitigate against kind of the need for cooling demand as well. So if you can shift grid offtakes through batteries at times of high temperatures, that's good for certainly the power system and probably quite wise in terms of mitigating price risk as well. Very interesting. Thanks a lot, Glenn. Great to have you here on the podcast. My pleasure. Thank you. One of the tangible demand side implications of the heat is the growing use of air conditioning. And I wanted to find out more about what that might mean for Europe in the future. Brian Motherway, head of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Inclusive Transitions at the International Energy Agency explained it. Brian, welcome to Energy Evolution. Very glad to have you here. Thank you very much. Pleasure to be here. So we're recording on the 15th of July. Much of Europe is currently experiencing heat waves. And it does seem like summers are getting hotter and more difficult to deal with, at least in some parts of the continent. I myself, I grew up in Central Europe, lived in England for a long time. And at least anecdotally, I don't have much experience with ACs. In most places, maybe you'll find a fan at most. I just closed the window here to be able to record with that background noise. And it's already getting pretty warm. So beyond the anecdotes, maybe you can provide some data on this. How widespread is the use of air conditioning in Europe compared to other markets, other regions? And has this started to change? I have a similar experience, Camilla, because I moved to France 10 years ago, and Paris had an extremely hot summer. And everyone told me this is such a rare occurrence here in Paris. But now, in the last 10 years, it's become almost every single year has a hot summer. And people are noticing, as you say. So we do see more people buying fans, of course, but air conditioning. In France, Western Europe is not a region traditionally associated with air conditioners. Maybe one in five households in the European Union owns an air conditioner. But of course, that varies from one in two in Greece and Spain to less than one in 10 in some of the northern countries. Here in France, it's about one in five, maybe one in four. It is becoming more common. It's still not normal. And the heat is still not as intense as in other regions in the world. But certainly, people are reacting. They want to stay cool. The world is getting hotter and people take appropriate steps. Are there certain countries in Europe where you're seeing demand for AC grow more than others? I guess it depends both on the temperature and also on the kinds of houses that people live in. I mean, certainly, again, if you take here in France, it's increasing by a few percent a year. But if you look at the stats now, 20-25% of homes have air conditioning, but it's much more common in houses and obviously, therefore, in less urban areas than it is in apartments, because it can often be more expensive to do it in an apartment block. It's not part of the traditional way buildings are built. Other than that, it follows the weather. So again, more than half the households in Greece and Spain have an air conditioner that's much higher than other countries, but they have been warmer for longer, if you like. And of course, there's an affordability question here in terms of, quite put simply, richer people are more likely to have air conditioners than less well-off people. You see that pattern all over the world. You see it even more so in developing regions. In India, only about one in 10 families have an air conditioner, and it's very much associated with whether people can afford it or not. So there's a real social unfairness issue here in terms of who can afford to stay cool in Europe and in the world. Have you at the IEA done some research on how the demand for AC units in Europe could change and what that would do to the overall power demand? So so far, the electricity demand associated with air conditioning in Europe is not particularly high. It's a couple of percent of overall electricity usage, but it is growing year on year by several percent. So we could imagine that over the next decade, certainly we expect the number of air conditioners to rise by 50 percent or more in Europe. And I could imagine that the energy demand associated with those air conditioners will rise at the same pace. It's still not the biggest driver of electricity demand, but it's certainly one of the fastest growing drivers of demand. And also it's a key issue for peak demand, because in certain regions, more and more on a particularly hot day, you're going to see demand spiking when it gets hot, when people turn on their air conditioners and fans. And that's becoming more of an issue for many countries as well. And are ACs the only option to keep cool or are there other technologies that we should be looking out for and other maybe means in which you could use nature or a tree cover, etc.? Are there other solutions that cities and regions should be taking better advantage of? I'm also thinking in terms of the AC units themselves. You tell me if this is true or not, that using AC actually pushes hot air out into the street and then increases the temperature around the building further. This is all true, Camilla. And first of all, there are ways of doing how we build cities better in terms of trees and shade and planning. And there are certainly ways of doing buildings better than others. And of course, you know that certain hotter countries, Southern European countries, have much better traditions of building buildings that stay naturally cooler because of the way they're built, the thickness of the walls, the quality of the installation, the way they're shaded. So this can make several degrees difference as a starting point. A building can be several degrees cooler if it's well built. And the first thing any country, any family, any society needs to do is think about we need to prepare for a hotter future and we need to be building our cities and our neighbourhoods and our buildings better and ready for this hotter future. And then, of course, there are huge differences in what equipment you buy. Air conditioners vary hugely in terms of their energy efficiency. You go into a shop today and you look at two air conditioners that cost more or less the same to buy, but one of them will literally use twice as much as electricity as the next one. And that therefore will cost you twice as much to run. So there are huge differences. And it's really important that somebody buying an air conditioner buy the most efficient one because it's going to save them money over years and decades in terms of how much it costs to power that. And maybe for listeners who don't have an idea of what this could look like, do you have any example that comes to mind of a best practice approach to this? Maybe in a certain city or certain region? So first of all, a well-built building is a well-built building and there's a lot of buildings in Europe that have been well-built in terms of their insulation, good quality windows and doors, etc. And of course, that was traditionally done to keep heat in because it's often driven by staying warm in the winter. Now, the same kind of insulation, the same kind of buildings will keep you cool in the summer. So all around us, there are good examples of well-built buildings that are good in both cases. When it's cold, they help you stay warm and when they're warm, they help you stay cold. If you look at Spain or North Africa, if you go to Morocco or Tunisia, you see buildings built with thicker stone, with courtyards, with different layouts, the ways that help them keep cool. And you can feel those buildings. If you ever go into any of these buildings, you can feel how cool these buildings can be even in very hot weather. And then, of course, the technology we use really matters and behavior really matters. An air conditioner uses maybe 40 times as much electricity as a fan, but of course, it keeps you much cooler. But if you consider using them both together, if you maybe set the temperature on the air conditioner a little bit higher and combine it with a fan, these are all ways of making people's lives more comfortable while minimizing their electricity use, therefore lowering their energy bills while also minimizing their impact on the environment. And getting back to the equipment of AC units, you already said that there are huge differences between different models. But when you look at the technology itself, do you see gains to be made in terms of improving the efficiency or are we, in terms of the best models, fairly optimized already? Well, I think, first of all, we see huge differences and we see this in every region of the world that it doesn't necessarily cost more to buy a more efficient air conditioner. It's just a question of picking the right one. And many countries use energy labels where you can figure out which one to buy, buy an A rated one instead of a C or D. So it's surprisingly varied how efficient air conditioners are that are being sold in the same market. And that's true of every part of the world. At the same time, I do think we can expect breakthroughs. Everybody knows we're moving into a hotter world. Everybody knows there's going to be a massive increase in the use of air conditioning and other technologies. So we see some quite exciting technologies that may emerge in the coming years. But we have to remember that this is quite an urgent problem right now. Somewhere in the world, anywhere in the world, every second, five air conditioners are being bought by somebody. So there's a huge growth in air conditioning as we speak. And that's because people are responding extremely reasonably and rationally to the heat they find themselves in and they want to be cooler. So the question is, are those five air conditioners being sold every second? Are they efficient? Are they inefficient? Are they locking in lower bills and less carbon emissions for the coming decades? Are they locking in higher bills and higher carbon emissions? And that's what government policies around information for consumers, minimum energy performance standards, design of buildings, all of this really matters now because the growth is happening now. All of this conversation around efficiency, of course, also ties into Europe's climate conversation. So by 2040, the EU wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels. So how does this increased energy demand from air conditioning play into Europe's climate goals? I think it's a key question. And I think we could expect that the energy demand for air conditioners in Europe will more than double between now and 2050, and if not more. And of course, that starts to make an impact, even though at the moment, air conditioners are not a massive user of electricity, it is absolutely going to grow. And as I said earlier, it's not just about how much overall energy they use, a key issue for air conditioners is their effect on peak demand, because of course, peak electricity tends to be the most expensive and the most polluting. So there's a key issue to make sure that our growth in air conditioners are part of a smarter electric future. We expect more of our lives to be run by electricity in the future, whether it's our cooling or our heating or driving electric cars. And it's absolutely vital that this all be part of a smart system where we're matching supply and demand so that we're making the maximum use of clean solar and clean wind when it's available, we're having some flexibility at peak loads, so that we're not driving up our use of fossil fuels. So air conditioning really needs to be factored in to the future of the European electricity system so that we can make sure people benefit from it, but in a way that doesn't affect Europe's ability to meet its energy and climate goals. I guess, Camilla, obviously your focus is on Europe, but I do want to stress that while this is really lively for Europe right now, and we see a massive increase in the demand for air conditioning, there are many parts of the world that are much hotter and where it's almost a life or death situation for people to have access to cooling in ways that is much less affordable. So we really want to see this as a global issue where regions like India, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, air conditioning ownership rates are, of course, much lower there because people can't afford them, but the pressures they feel and the health impacts they feel from heat are far greater than even we're experiencing yet.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-07-15\n==================================================\n\n### The road to commercial nuclear fusion\n**Episode ID:** 5063\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985610\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello and welcome to Energy Evolution, the S&P Global Commodity Insights Podcast, dedicated to covering the fascinating and ever-changing world of the energy transition. This week we're checking into nuclear fusion, which is the technology that can transform how we power our world. This episode, we'll examine how big tech companies are racing to secure their stake in what many see as the holy grail of clean energy. And I'm lucky to be joined by our correspondent, Camilla Nashat. Welcome, Camilla. Hi, Klavia. So nuclear fusion is basically the process where two light atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier one. And in the process, they release a ton of energy. Now, research on fusion kicked off in the early 20th century, with scientists like Hans Bethe doing a lot of the foundational work back in the 1930s, figuring out how stars produce energy through this process. And the push for harnessing fusion for energy really took off in the 1950s, especially during the Cold War, and countries were eager to find new energy sources. And the first big breakthrough came in 1952 with hydrogen bombs. But it wasn't until the invention of devices like Tokamaks and inertial confinement systems that serious research began. But here's what's exciting. We've hit some major milestones recently. In December 2022, the National Ignition Facility in the US achieved something scientists had been working towards for decades. They got more energy out of a fusion reaction and they put in. And that's what we call ignition. Yet, despite this breakthrough, we're still facing significant hurdles before fusion becomes a commercial reality. Camilla, what are you seeing in terms of the current landscape? Yeah, that's right. Aside from the technical challenges, there are material limitations as well when it comes to fusion energy. The materials used in fusion reactors must be able to withstand extreme heat and radiation over a long period of time. And critics also point to high costs for the research required and argue that this money could be better spent on renewables. And as with other forms of nuclear energy, there are safety concerns as well, which play into public perception and support for the technology. So in a nutshell, fusion research has come a long way since it started with some exciting developments, as you said. But there is a long journey ahead before it becomes a reality for powering our homes and our businesses. The enthusiasm for the technology is growing, though, and we're seeing increased willingness from investors to back nuclear fusion startups, for example. And as we'll hear in this episode, the tech industry is actually among the front runners in this game. That's given their expected power demand growth from AI data center computing power. Now to hear more about all of this, let's bring in our first guest. Francesco Schiartino is the co-founder and CEO of Proxima Fusion, a German company working on fusion power plants. Francesco, welcome to Energy Evolution. Maybe you can start out with introducing yourself. I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about your background and how you ended up founding Proxima Fusion. Yeah, happy to. Thanks for having me. I'm a physicist by background. I am originally from Italy, but I lived in the UK for five years, then one year in Switzerland, five years in the US. Did my PhD at MIT on Tokamaks. Maybe we'll talk more about what those are. Basically the most conventional way of doing magnetic confinement fusion. Then I joined the Max Planck Society, which is an organization of national labs in Germany, still on the Tokamak side. And then in 2022, I got more and more interested in stellarators, another kind of magnetic confinement fusion device. And early 2023, we span out from the Max Planck Society and created Proxima Fusion. And today we are about 90 people between Munich, Zurich and Oxford, all across Europe, basically. And we're working on stellarators for fusion power plants. Great. I can imagine that for many listeners, stellarators is not a household term. So let's dive into the technology. Can you explain what stellarators are, how they differ from other ways of producing nuclear fusion energy and how you at Proxima are working on this? Effectively, we are trying to build a star in a laboratory. And we're trying to do that by taking this hot ionized matter that is called a plasma, by confining it into a magnetic bottle. And that magnetic bottle for us looks like a donut. And that donut has magnetic field lines, which hold this plasma, this hot ionized matter, away from material surfaces. There is no material surface that can hold the temperatures of this plasma. We're looking at 100, 150 million degrees, so more than 10 times the center of the sun. And so the magnetic fields have the function of creating that confinement, that bottle effect. Now, the difference between a tokamak and a stellarator is relatively subtle. I would say that a stellarator is more intuitive in the sense that this donut shape, we don't just want magnetic field lines to go in the long direction of the donut. We actually want them to twist around to create a helical pattern, let's say. That gives us the best way of confining the plasma. So a stellarator is more intuitive in the sense that you want magnetic field lines to go around in a helical pattern. So you can try to make magnets to create this magnetic field that also twist around to create something like a helical pattern. In practice, you can make those magnets not really go around in a snake-like form all around the donut. You can break them into modular magnets. And that's the kind of stellarator that we are looking at as Proxima Fusion. A tokamak, the more conventional approach that I use to research, is similar but has at the center of the donut, maybe it's better to think of it as an apple rather than a donut, in the apple, the core of the apple, is what is called the transformer. A component, a piece of powerful electronics that is creating a large current in the plasma. So it's an extra piece of technology that is adding a large current to basically simplify the overall design. And that overall design becomes easier when the magnets become flat. So a tokamak, when you compare a picture of a tokamak and a stellarator, the first thing you notice is a tokamak has all the magnets flat, it looks simpler, it's simpler to design, simpler to manufacture. But the challenge with a tokamak is what you don't see and it's that it's really hard to control in practice. It has instabilities that we've been trying to control and to partly live with for many, many years, many decades. In a stellarator, the challenge instead is in making the magnets that look twisty. And that twistiness is a challenge in both design and then eventually in manufacturing. And Proxima was founded on the observation that the modeling and the scientific basis for stellarators has now advanced to the point where we know that we can design these devices. We also have a fantastic prototype of what a stellarator power plant could look like that is represented by a stellarator in the north of Germany called W7X. That's the most advanced stellarator in the world. It's a facility that costed the German government and the European Union about 1.5 billion dollars. And that's the facility that Proxima effectively spun out from. And we think that scales much better to a power plant. So both tokamak stellarators are magnetic confinement devices at the end of the day. They are doughnuts with magnets. There are many other kinds of fusion devices with lasers, with pistons, with supercapacitors. Each of these has their own parts and you won't be surprised to hear that there are many opinions in the field on what works the best. Right now there are 60 fusion companies, give or take. Stellarators are fairly well represented in that category and Proxima is now the best funded stellarator company in the world. And you just mentioned already that there are still a host of challenges that you and the wider industry are grappling with. But what would you say would be the next milestones that you're working on and your team are working on? It's related to the magnets. So the intensity of the magnetic field that you produce in these doughnut shaped devices is very strongly correlated. The relation between magnetic field intensity and fusion power that you can produce is very, very strong. If you don't mind me using a formula on the podcast, the fusion power scales with the magnetic field to the power of four. That means if you can double the magnetic field intensity, you get two to the four equals 16 times more power out. We are talking about quadrupling the field intensity at the center of the plasma. That means we're talking about new magnet technology that we are developing that can increase the fusion power by more than two orders of magnitude. The key milestone ahead for us is in mid-2027 to show a full scale full power demonstration of one such magnet of the right kind of shape. We call this the stellarator motor coil. And once we demonstrate that magnet a full power, we think we've knocked out the most important technology milestone that then leaves a clear way, a clear path to making an energy stellarator. And where does that path end? What kind of timeline can we imagine for this to move out of a pilot to a real power plant? So the magnet, the stellarator motor coil, as we call it, is in mid-2027. Then we have four years of assembly of a device that we call Alpha. That's a net energy producing device. In other words, it's a demonstration. It's not quite a power plant. In other words, you give me 50 megawatts, I give you back 50 megawatts. Your 50 megawatts might be from coal gas or whatever. I give you back 50 megawatts from fusion. That's an important milestone. It's the demonstration that you are at a scale, at a capacity that is very interesting, especially if your device is able to naturally go into steady state, so continuous operation, and if it's intrinsically stable. And that's the key focus of Proxima. The stellarator as opposed to a tokamak, especially a category of stellarators called Qi stellarator, is a device that is naturally able to go into continuous operation and that is always stable. So if we knock that out in the roadmap, we want to have first operation of the Alpha stellarator in 2031, and then full power net energy demonstration as soon as possible, hopefully 2032. And then we will proceed to a first of a kind fusion power plant. Right now we say as a goal for the company to do a first of a kind power plant within the 2030s. And that means as soon as we can, as close to 2035 as possible, but generally within the second half of the 2030s. If we get that as expected, then the 2040s should be the time when we scale up as fast as we can. We hope to see a great exponential, the likes of which we've seen, for example, in France, when there was a deployment of fission power plants in the 70s, 80s. We know as humanity how to deploy hardware at very large scale for energy systems. We need to have the right kind of motivation, the right kind of drive, let's say, to make a new energy transformation, the likes of which fusion can bring about. And clearly you've been able to convince some investors of this roadmap as well. Proxima raised 130 million euros of Series A funding quite recently. Can you explain why now was the time that you were able to raise this funding and how does that fit into the funding requirements for the longer roadmap? Right, so the total raised amount for the company, including this latest Series A, is about 200 million dollars between public and private funding. What I think investors both on a European and US level have appreciated is the speed of quality of execution. We're a team that is based all across Europe. Many of us have actually spent quite a bit of our lives in the United States. We have seen the opportunity to translating best engineering quality from German national labs, bringing together a community from across Europe and also the US into an engineering project that now we have shown can actually scale much faster than most people expect. So over the first two years we started out saying we can produce a reactor design over 24 months. In practice we took only 12 months. We then decided to publish that. That design is called the Stellaris design and you can find it online. It's a published peer-reviewed paper that we decided to share with the world. We then got into R&D, working the lab, especially focused on superconducting magnets. Now it's been some time we're transforming again as a company into a manufacturing company and this rapid transformation is what Venture Capital really wants to see. Not an ambition of knocking out one milestone after the other one in a very predictable way but rather surprising everyone in terms of overcoming previous barriers. So for us the why now moment was really 2022, something got unlocked on the design side. We showed in 2022 as a community of research in Stellarators that it was now possible to optimize numerically Stellarators to come to new trade-offs between the physics and engineering constraints and that really changed the whole game. Also we started as a company from W7X and the ability to transfer the know-how from the world's leading Stellarator in the world. W7X is really incredible in what it has achieved. The ability to translate that into a commercial path that we have shown over the last couple of years to be transformational. The investors fundamentally are not in the game to support a moonshot project for the sake of humanity but really to make money. So part of the enabling element of the story is that we are creating intellectual property that would be at the basis of an entire new industry. Fusion is not something to tiptoe into. It's understood by our investors that this could be entirely transformational. The market size is enormous. Maybe energy is the single largest market that anyone can actually try to tap into. We're looking at 10 trillion dollars more or less. The question is how do you access it and it's right now in Fusion a question of feasibility rather than how cheap is it. Eventually we have to make a device that is commercially attractive. So it does boil down to levelized cost of electricity. We need to reach less than a hundred dollars per megawatt hour and we need to do that with a clear path to decreasing costs over multiple generations of power plants. So iteration speed is very important and I think over the first two years of Proxima's life the investors have seen that quality and iteration speed is the one thing we're selling. Now if we look at funding rounds more globally we've noticed a trend of tech companies putting quite a lot of money into funding Fusion ventures recently partly driven by this concept that we've talked about on the show before of exponentially growing data center power demand or projections of that at least. Is that where you see a lot of the potential sort of this additional growth in power demand or which use case settings do you envisage for your stellarators in the future? Yeah there is a lot of demand and a lot of excitement around the market represented by data centers. I would say that the data centers are really at the forefront of people's imagination because AI is enabling so much of new applications in society but actually we didn't need the data centers to realize that human civilization scales with energy effectively. So the access to energy is directly proportional pretty much to our ability to manufacture, to give quality of life. There is still much of the world population that does not have access to energy and here we're talking about clean energy, safe energy and that has a completely different kind of appeal compared to gas, coal and whatnot. So data centers are definitely raising the attention maybe worth mentioning here the power purchase agreement that Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a fusion company based in Boston, has announced just a couple of days ago with Google that is a major milestone for the whole field. The Commonwealth Fusion Systems colleagues are doing great at building a tokamak. So the kind of device that I mentioned earlier I used to work at and regardless of whether one thinks that the tokamak is the best path forward or not it's incredibly good that now we are at the point where the magnetic confinement fusion technology has reached maturity and there is enough momentum to see the first customers effectively. So Google needs an outrageous amount of energy to power the data centers that directly determine the success of Google itself. So now Google is looking at multiple paths to its energy procurement. In the short term they have made public that they have been looking at solar and wind and batteries. In the medium term they're looking at geothermal and small modular reactors using fission. Fusion is in the long term but it's now time. Right now in the 2020s we are creating intellectual property that is at the basis of this new energy generation and massive scales and it's great that Google is recognizing that and not only Google. Yeah and that kind of brings me to my final point you mentioned this PPA in Boston whether there is a global race to be first a race for fusion and to what extent Europe in a good position there maybe relative to the US relative to China. Yeah the race is real right now there are these 50-60 fusion companies all racing to be first. In reality this is I believe this is going to be also a quite geopolitical game. It's quite likely that now we have about 10 companies that have raised more than 100 million which is enough to go and demonstrate key technology enablers. Let's say for us that's a full-scale superconducting non-planar so weirdly shaped magnet. There are other companies that are trying to prove themselves through their technology enablers. There is going to be a sub-selection of those that actually manage to get to that. Maybe six companies are going to go out and have enough funding one billion dollar scale funding to go and build the net energy demonstrator and then there will be a few players that go and build first-of-a-kind fusion power plants. These are not likely to be all in China or in Europe or in the US. It's quite likely that there will be a one or two US champions one or two European champions and one true Asian champions. In the US and Asia I think in some types of fusion R&D some champions have been emerging. In Europe now with the latest round Proxima takes quite a stance but really the competition in fusion is still quite open. There is still great diversity of thinking about what will work best so it's players in the game still need to prove fundamentally themselves. Eventually it's not just about doing the energy it is about delivering energy at a cost that makes compelling a compelling case for the energy markets. It's also a game where the public is going to play a significant role. For Proxima now in Germany the alignment with the German government and with various state governments is crucial. I personally believe that deep tech and climate tech large-scale technologies that try to tackle big problems they require an alignment between the public and the private which is not entirely common and right now we have a big problem related to the energy transition is incredibly large problem. I think most people quite really struggle to get their head around the fact that we're not trying to build one gigawatt we need thousands of gigawatts we need thousands of power plants that means we need the public and the private to come together to realize how do we scale up new technology as fast as we can. So in the competition how governments will play will also make a big difference. Thank you Camilla. As you mentioned much of the investment behind fusion companies has come from the big tech sector and data from S&P global market intelligence 451 research shows that recent global funding exceeds 7.1 billion dollars across 50 startups many of whom are backed by big tech. Yes that's exactly right and to get into some of the details on how tech companies are thinking of fusion in their energy procurement strategy let's hear from Steve Piper director of energy research here at Commodity Insights. Steve thank you so much for joining us on the show now you and your team have recently written about this growth in funding for fusion ventures that we've seen recently especially from the tech sector so I'm curious to hear a little bit more about that research and how you see that trend evolving. Do you want to give us an overview of some notable recent funding rounds and maybe some numbers some names and how that's changed in the last couple of years? Yes Camilla thank you for having me on. Fusion has rather famously or notoriously always been 10 years away as a source of commercial energy commercial electricity but it has of course intriguing properties that align with the goal of tech sector investment hyperscale loads that support cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure with zero carbon electricity and more recently a number of companies have made sufficient progress and developed pathways of research that hint at potential commercialization of electricity from fusion. There are a lot of private sector call them startups firms that have been working on different approaches to fusion for quite a bit of time but are now independently pursuing this technology. There are probably in the United States three companies that have probably have been the most successful in raising funds for their approaches. There are actually more than three companies trying different approaches but for kind of an overview of the space we have Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised about two billion dollars in pursuit of a more conventional tokamak fusion reactor. This is a team that was spun out of MIT in Boston. They made a big splash just early in July with the planned reactor that they have in Chesterfield Virginia. Roughly 400 megawatts is their goal to have that in service by the mid 2030s. So yes still 10 years off but with a greater degree of confidence and ultimate success Google has signed a power purchase agreement for 200 megawatts of that capacity. So we're seeing these tech companies have enough of an expression of confidence in the progress what these fusion companies are doing to put ink to paper and at least to outline a power purchase agreement. So Commonwealth Fusion Systems about two billion dollars raised 200 megawatt PPA for their first reactor if they're able to bring it to service. TAE Technologies has raised about 1.2 billion dollars. Their approach has established a stable plasma at 70 million degrees. The key to any of these approaches is to establish a stable plasma in a strong magnetic field of somewhere between 150 million and 200 million degrees centigrade. For context they've got a stable plasma at 70 million degrees. They'll try to gradually step that up to a level that can produce commercial quantities of electricity. Third is Helion. They've raised about a billion dollars. They made a big splash a couple of years ago announcing a 50 megawatt power purchase agreement with Microsoft and a target date of 2028. Now that's just around the corner so if they were able to meet that target of course that would be big news. Their next prototype which aims for a stable plasma at around 100 million degrees would be the next threshold for them to achieve. They had hoped to achieve something like that by the end of 2024 so they're a bit behind schedule. That might ultimately affect their continued funding but that's the next step that Helion is aiming at. So a lot of activity in the space. The tech sector is I think aware that these investments are to some extent moonshots but a lot of interest in pursuing these independent minds of fusion research. Yeah and I mean your research obviously focused on the tech sector among the investor base behind fusion ventures. Are they the most significant backers and why is that? I think it's fair to say that tech companies investing in sort of hyperscale data centers have become significant and growing backers of a number of different clean energy technologies. They have signed agreements for the next generation of small modular reactors on the nuclear side across a number of potential developers there. They have signed power purchase agreements with enhanced geothermal systems. There's a growing awareness that the suite of mature emissions-free technologies, think wind power, the solar photovoltaic, carrying that at times with batteries, doesn't deliver 24-7 electricity with those zero emissions characteristics. We're still looking for that kind of ideal power source that can deliver baseload electricity and in pursuit of that data centers have placed a number of funding bets across a variety of technologies. Fusion in terms of its contribution it's a little bit further out and it's at a little bit lower scale but there's a recognition that if that bet were to pay off then data centers could commercialize emissions-free potentially inexpensive and reliable electricity and help manage the implications and consequences of all this load growth that we anticipate coming out of the cloud computing and the AI infrastructure. And all of this load growth is fairly real and fairly tangible. I mean plans are for the next years here and maybe the next decade and as you say Fusion is a little bit further out maybe in the 2040s, 2050s. So how are they so motivated to invest in something so early stage given the potential delivery risks of this? It's a really interesting question. I think part one to that answer is that there's a growing realization that that Fusion could be available somewhat sooner on the one hand and that the research pathways for Fusion are becoming maybe a little bit shorter. Lawrence Livermore National Labs were able to achieve positive energy on a Fusion reaction. The system energy was still negative but that provided a path forward for additional research because you can look at that whole process chain and say okay can we make the lasers that trigger the reaction more efficient. We're dealing with 30 or 40 year old infrastructure. Can we look at that process end to end and leverage off of the positive energy achieved by the National Laboratory? The longest plasma that's been sustained at this point is about 22 minutes certainly well short of commerciality but they were seeing Fusion occur in that reaction still at negative net energy but the research paths are unfolding that sort of dance around that possibility of positive net energy. So they're seeing a research path forward. The tech sector funding independent lines of research and all of the sources of power that data centers are pursuing are going to take time. The next generation of nuclear plants they're looking at early 2030s to see those prototypes come in. Even natural gas generation the turbine orders are backing up and to put new generation on the ground is a three to five year timeline. So part of the answer the second part of the answer is that it's going to take time to put large amounts of generation on the ground regardless of what you're investing in. Fusion given the shortening timelines and research pathways and the lengthening timelines to add other forms of generation starts to look like it can fit into the mix. Something else that I was wondering is what exactly Google or Facebook are buying as in how what are they getting in exchange for their investment? Is it just the knowledge that they are supporting a technology that will become relevant for them in the future or are they securing some kind of future output already or some kind of intellectual property that they have access to? Well I think it's a combination of those things I mean you know first and foremost access to reliable electricity to power data centers to allow them to scale up artificial intelligence infrastructure the training and inference. All of these firms are vying to be first to market with the most AI tools they can support and see a need for securing long-term access to the electricity necessary to sustain those operations. And then secondarily and maybe not secondarily I think it's top of mind for all of them that their customers their users you know want emissions-free electricity they want it to be as economical as possible and they want it to be sustainable and so they've pursued these mandates for net zero generation from their operations that's been part of their culture going back 10 15 years or more and so these approaches are all meant to bring together reliable baseload power that is also emissions-free.

I'm your host Ikhlavya Gupte and in this episode we're exploring a fascinating intersection between the traditional heavy industry and the clean energy transition, fertilizers. Now you might be wondering why we're discussing fertilizers on an energy podcast. Well the answer lies in ammonia, the backbone of nitrogen fertilizer production and increasingly a potential game-changer for clean energy storage and transport. This dual role makes fertilizers a perfect lens through which to examine how energy intensive industries are navigating decarbonization while potentially becoming enablers of the transition itself. Now the fertilizer sector has been through an extraordinary turbulence in recent years from pandemic supply chain disruptions to the Russia- Ukraine wars energy price shocks and now the emerging regulatory pressures from policies like Europe's carbon border adjustment mechanism. Now these developments are reshaping not only how we produce food but potentially how we store and transport renewables globally and today I'm lucky to be joined by Matt Hoisch, a senior reporter on the Platz fertilizers and minerals pricing team who covers the fertilizer industry and is perfectly placed to give us a deep dive into this fascinating industry. Welcome Matt. Thanks Ikhlavya, good to be here. So to start off with, can you please set the scene for why the fertilizer industry is so important and interesting from an energy perspective? Absolutely I'll probably start off by saying maybe some listeners have a more antiquated let's say image of what fertilizers are. They might be imagining bird poop or cow dung which would have been maybe an accurate representation of the industry a century or two ago let's say but as you mentioned in that introduction fertilizers are one of the major energy intensive industries globally. Now a lot of that energy in the fertilizer space as you mentioned is going toward the production of ammonia and this is where I'll do a brief detour maybe into some basic biology that some folks might remember from their schooling. Plants need a couple of key nutrients to grow and some of the major ones are phosphorus and potassium as well as nitrogen. Now phosphorus and potassium are mainly coming from mining operations. They're nutrients that can be gathered from the soil so to speak. Nitrogen, it's a little bit different. It's actually abundantly available in the atmosphere around us but not in a form that is assimilable by plants to help them grow. To alleviate that issue, chemists in the early 20th century developed a process that allows us to synthetically convert that nitrogen into, as you mentioned, ammonia, NH3, which is that vital form of nitrogen that allows us to then convert that into nitrogen fertilizers that plants can use to grow. The interesting thing about that process to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia is that a surprising share of the world's energy resources go toward it and if you're not neck deep in the fertilizer industry like I am, you might be surprised to know that according to the International Energy Agency, about 2% of global final energy consumption goes toward that ammonia production process. All around the world, plants are using this century plus old process in chemistry to convert nitrogen in the atmosphere into ammonia. And when we think about the energy sources going into that process, the lion's share, about 75% or so, is natural gas and a lot of the rest of that is coming from coal-fired units in China. And the really interesting space that we're looking at, looking ahead, that we'll talk about later in this conversation, I'm sure, is the question of what would it mean to put more of that process into the renewable space. Thank you. Some very interesting statistics there and shows the role it does play in emissions. And obviously global energy markets have seen massive volatility amid the Israel-Iran tensions. Has there been a similar impact in fertilizer markets? That's the interesting thing here. Because energy is such a major input in fertilizer production, what we do see in the fertilizer space is that when energy markets have their major ups or their major downs, there are ripples that come into the fertilizer market. So obviously, as you mentioned recently, these tensions between Israel and Iran got a lot of international attention in oil and gas markets in particular because a massive share of the world's oil and gas exports flow through the Strait of Hormuz, this region by Iran that there was a lot of concern could be shut off as a result of this conflict. Fertilizers actually also do flow pretty substantially through that region. So there was some jitters over the potential for a straight closure to also impact fertilizer exports. But also we saw an impact from just the energy side of things in general. And I'll give two examples, one of which was urea, which is a major nitrogen fertilizer. We saw prices spike in some regions because of energy impacts. Algeria is a major producer of urea, a major producer, a major exporter. Our FOB Algeria assessment classes jumped over 25 percent over the week of that conflict to just over $500 per ton FOB. First time that happened since early 2023. And a big reason for that was that another major urea producer, Egypt, got its gas supply cut off from Israel, which supplies a lot of natural gas to Egypt. As a result, it had to cut off urea production. And just in that example alone, we can see how intertwined the geopolitics of energy and fertilizer can be. And one more example I'll give is over in the European context. We similarly saw a pretty massive spike in TTF, the European gas benchmark, over the course of that conflict. And similarly, we saw a pretty significant bullish outlook in the European fertilizer space over the period of that conflict. And that has since subsided a bit as the conflict subsided, as TTF gas prices went down. But really, it's safe to say that as energy prices fluctuate, so too do fertilizer prices. Let's show how intertwined these markets are with various sectors, especially energy. And now, given your particular focus on the European market, can you talk about the close connection between fertilizers and energy and how that translates to the European context? Right. So anyone that follows the energy space probably knows that the key with Europe is it has very high energy costs. And that's the theme of European industrial discussions over the last several years is how do you operate heavy industry in Europe when energy costs comparatively are fairly prohibitive? And I'll give two figures that probably help illustrate this. I'll go back to urea, this major nitrogen fertilizer that uses gas as a major input. Commodity Insights, our analysts put out a report a few months ago, and one of the figures in it was looking at the cost of urea production in the U.S. versus in Northwest Europe on average in 2025. It's their projections. In the U.S., the analysts project that the average cost of urea production is around $150. In Northwest Europe, that same projection, $360. It's more than double because Europe faces such a disadvantage when it comes to energy prices. Similarly, we see when European energy prices spiked as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we also saw a spike in fertilizer prices. Really, what I'm trying to say is that the politics of European fertilizers is pretty closely intertwined with the politics of energy. And one thing we've seen recently from 2021 to 23, it's the most recent year with the data available from Eurostat, European synthetic fertilizer production has actually declined about 25%. And the most interesting development that we've seen recently, as partly a result of these higher energy costs, is the EU is looking to more restrictive trade measures to protect the industry. So Europe over the last few years has really tried to wean itself off of Russian gas and LNG. It's been more successful in the gas space than in the LNG space. But one thing that the European fertilizer industry has argued is that as Europe brings in less Russian gas, we're just seeing a greater reliance on Europe bringing in Russian fertilizers, which they describe as gas in another form. And one saga that I've been tracking as a reporter since the start of the year has been this gradual process for Europe to impose some pretty substantial tariffs on Russian fertilizers in an effort to similarly as it has to gas to wean the continent off of its reliance on Russian fertilizers. Those tariffs actually went into effect July 1. And I won't go into the details because there's a lot to go through there. But the general picture is that they're set to escalate gradually over the next three years until by 2028. They're meant to reach somewhere in the ballpark of between 315 to 430 euros, which is quite a lot when you consider the cost of urea in France. Recently, we assessed at Platts around 490 euros. I mean, you're looking at pretty mid to high double digit percentages on those tariffs. So it's going to be interesting to see as Europe really tries to pull itself off of some of its energy dependencies. It's trying to play a similar game in the fertilizer space. And I think it's going to be a major question of how those tariffs reshape this global and European market. And now looking a little bit more long term, obviously, ammonia is a big hot topic in the green energy space. And we know that fertilizer industry is going to play a big role in this. Right. Well, fertilizers, like you mentioned earlier, Klavia, it's fascinating because it kind of has maybe two ways to think about the energy transition. Like any energy intensive industry, the fertilizer industry is focused on reducing its carbon emissions. And according to the IEA, ammonia production, it accounts for about 1.3% of global CO2 emissions. So when we're thinking about decarbonization, the fertilizer industry needs to be a part of that conversation. If we can't do that, we are going to continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere. So the fertilizer industry looking at carbon capture and storage, renewable energy, biomethane, all these different ways to reduce carbon emissions from this energy intensive process. But the other avenue that is fairly unique, I think, to the fertilizer industry is that the product that is so core to their business, ammonia, is also seen as this potential major player in a renewable energy future, particularly around areas like bunkering for ships, for instance, it's seen as a fuel that could really fuel a renewable energy future. So that's really put a lot of interest into the fertilizer space. And at Platts, we have a large and I shouldn't say growing suite of ammonia price assessments that puts us in a very prime position to explore and examine how this market grows and develops over the coming years. We assess a benchmark CFR Northwest Europe ammonia price. We also have CFR India price to name another consuming region, as well as many assessments in major producing regions like the US Gulf or North Africa. So we're paying pretty close attention to see how this new and growing interest in ammonia reshapes the conventional as well as the future renewable green ammonia market. And obviously here, the challenge with ammonia is that it's only really useful from an energy transition perspective if it's low or zero carbon. So what is the status of the low carbon ammonia market? Right. And that's the caveat. We have gray ammonia is what it's called ammonia produced with natural gas that has all those carbon emissions. And in the energy transition space, you could have blue ammonia. That's ammonia plus carbon capture and storage. Green ammonia made with renewable energy. There's even pink ammonia, which is made using nuclear energy. There really is kind of a whole rainbow here. But there is a lot of interest in these low carbon ammonia options. And I think the thing with this space, though, is that it's still fairly nascent. So there was a another recent report from some of our analysts here at S&P Global Commodity Insights looking at low carbon ammonia development. And their figures show that through 2030, the projects that have actually reached final investment decision really come out to around 6.8 million metric tons of low carbon ammonia production FID through 2030. And that's about ballpark 4.2 million is blue, 2.6 million is green. But to put that into context, global ammonia production currently capacity, it's around 250 million metric tons. So when you really put 6.8 million against 250 million, you can see that there is still a pretty hefty the lion's share of this market is in the gray space. So there's a lot of expectation. But I think there's a lot of question around how we get there, right? The Americas is poised to be a large supplier of low carbon ammonia, according to Commodity Insights analysts. Interestingly enough, in part, that's because of the abundant supply of cheaper natural gas. So low energy costs put them in a good spot to be able to supply low carbon ammonia economically down the line. I think the other big thing to keep an eye on, though, is going to be this question of demand in the low carbon ammonia space. Again, the numbers are massive. We see Commodity Insights analysts forecasting global ammonia demand to grow to around 390 million metric tons by 2050. That's like almost doubling on the demand side. And most of that is expected to come from low carbon ammonia. So there's the potential for quite a lot of growth there. Currently, though, what we're seeing is that these markets are still fairly illiquid. And it's still the case that if you want to build one of these green blue, these low carbon ammonia projects, that a lot of financial folks are still requiring projects to have a good deal of offtake agreements to guarantee that the supply is in fact going to be bought, to be sold, that revenue will be generated. So we're yet to see the market come to the shape of the current gray ammonia market, which we look at on a daily basis and has pretty decent liquidity. The question is going to be how and when does the low carbon ammonia space get to that state? And now from a policy perspective, obviously, one of the things that is probably going to really change this market in the coming years is CBAM or Europe's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. So what is the expectation that this policy, how will it change the balance as far as the fertilizer industry in Europe and also the output of green and blue ammonia? Yeah, CBAM is one of the big bits of uncertainty here. And fertilizers, like you said, it's one of the seven industries that essentially if you're importing ammonia or fertilizers into Europe from overseas, you're going to have to start paying these escalating fees that are calculated based on the carbon intensity of the product brought in. And so what that means is that ammonia with higher or lower carbon intensities, the carbon intensity becomes a more salient factor in how people are thinking about this. I think based on my reporting, there's still a lot of uncertainty, to be honest, around what CBAM is actually going to do to the market. I think it's interesting because it really is going to add an incentive to decarbonize, it's going to add an incentive to have at least lower carbon ammonia or fertilizers, which will, in theory, allow importers or overseas producers to be more competitive. Again, I think the big thing to focus on here from, let's say, the fertilizer, the ammonia perspective, is going to be this question of demand creation, right? When I talk to, let's say, fertilizer companies, the technology is there. They're able to make these green fertilizers, low carbon ammonia, that can be an input into the green fertilizers. But the question is, who's going to buy them? I talked to some folks, and the answer right now is it's maybe more boutique buyers. Let's say if you're a food company that wants to market some product as particularly low carbon, you'll buy your low carbon green fertilizers, and then you can say that your potato chips are low carbon. But at the moment, there's less appetite in more of a general market space for that. So it's going to be interesting to see if CBAM is able to play a role in catalyzing that more general demand creation. The other CBAM bit that's going to be, at least in the near term, a pretty interesting saga to follow is actually around the exports question. So particularly in the European fertilizer space, a lot of European producers actually rely on overseas consumers. And it's only around 16% of EU fertilizer production is actually exported. But some factories are really attuned to that overseas market to the point that some of them export up to 60% of their production outside the trading block. But as you can imagine, what that means is in a space where we have CBAM, which it's important to remember, is going hand in hand with the reduction of free EUAs, free allowances for carbon emissions to European companies, as those European companies also have to pay more and more for their carbon emissions. There's a concern that they might become less and less competitive to those overseas consumers, who are an important source of demand for a lot of those European factories. So currently, I know the EU is working through a potential mechanism for something like a rebate, where if you're producing in the EU and exporting, the hope is that there can be some kind of a system that enables them to be more competitive for overseas consumers. But if you're someone like me, like yourself, that's been following CBAM closely, you know that nothing's over till it's over. So I think we're all going to be watching pretty closely to see how the EU crafts this policy over the coming months. And then especially next year, once the rubber really does hit the road and CBAM goes fully into effect. That's great. I think this is a good place to end things for now.

CEO says ocean mining permit coming 'sooner than people expect'\n**Episode ID:** 5065\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985669\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nAll right, welcome to Energy Evolution, where we explore the latest trends and innovations shaping the energy landscape. I'm your host, Taylor Kirkendall, and today we're diving into a topic that's making waves in both the environmental and economic sectors, talking about deep sea mining. Deep sea mining involves the extraction of minerals and resources from the ocean floor. Now, as the demand for metals like cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements rises, driven by the growth of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles, companies are starting to turn their sights to some more extreme locations to find some of these materials, including the ocean depths. Now, the mining process involves these remotely operated vehicles that are equipped with specialized tools to collect nodules from the bottom of the ground and bring them to the surface. This technology is fascinating, but it also raises significant environmental concerns. The ocean is a delicate ecosystem, and disturbing the seabed can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting habitats and threatening marine life. So do be aware that there are some people that are pushing back on some of the development here. Now, what they're actually looking for when they go underwater is looking for these things called polymetallic modules. They're small, potato-shaped rocks that contain these valuable metals that they're looking for. They form on the ocean floor over millions of years, and can be found in abundance in certain regions, like the Clarion-Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean. Now, today we're welcoming back Jared Barrett. He's CEO of The Metals Company. They're working to mine the ocean floor. Earlier this year, The Metals Company formally initiated a process with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under the U.S. Department of Commerce to apply for exploration licenses and commercial recovery permits under existing U.S. legislation. Let's just dive right into that conversation that we had with Jared now. Hi, Jared. Thank you so much for joining us back here on Energy Evolution. Just to start off with, can you kind of give us a high-level overview of The Metals Company, what we're talking about when we're talking about deep-sea mining, and what it is exactly we're down there looking for? Yeah. The Metals Company are focused on developing ocean metals. Think of the planet as 70% ocean, yet we get no metals out of those very same oceans. We're focused on a deposit about 1,100 miles southwest of San Diego. It sits 4,000 meters below sea level in the form of polymetallic nodules. We go back to that global picture again, 70% of the known reserves of nickel, and cobalt, and manganese sit in this one deposit. If I was with you, I'd hand you a nodule that's about the size of a potato. They literally lie unattached on the ocean floor. What we've been focused on over the last 14 years is understanding the resource, how big it is, understanding what's the most efficient way of picking up these rocks, causing the least impact, and then also studying what the environmental impacts will be of removing them from that ecosystem. We're now getting to the final stages, where we're about to seek a permit to enable us to move from the exploration phase into the commercial recovery phase. We're doing that through the United States government. This resource represents an opportunity for us to ship those metals to the USA and help make America mineral-independent, a little bit like it became energy-independent with the development of shale oil fields. I'm wondering, too, one of the big developments we saw recently was an executive order from Trump supporting this kind of activity. Can you tell me a little bit about what exactly that meant and how those companies' mission fits into what the administration's thinking these days in terms of mineral supply chains? We know that the current administration under President Trump have, at the core, re-industrialization. They need to bring back jobs. They need to secure supply lines. That means you need to go and find where you're going to get these metals from. If it ain't grown, it's mined. Of course, what the West has done, including the USA, is, over the last decades, depended heavily on other parties. China and Russia are two that come to mind. When COVID arrived, it showed what happens when you interrupt a supply chain. It means that those industries that use those metals as their foundation can't continue, can't develop. Of course, in the last several decades, we've seen America lose those industries to other developing countries, particularly in Asia. What the Trump administration are very focused on is, how do we secure the supply lines? How do we bring back those jobs, bring back those industries into the United States? When the Trump administration was elected and the cabinet was chosen, we made the decision that we would seek permitting through the U.S. agency, NOAA, where the exploration and the commercial recovery rules already exist to enable us to lodge that application. We announced at the end of March that, in fact, would be our intention. Of course, we saw the executive order come out on April 24. What that really did was say, now we want to fast-track the development of these resources that we, America, have access to, both in our territorial waters and also in the expanse of waters. That's what we're going through the permitting process now with the federal agency. The executive order was an amazing boost for us, and it certainly focused the minds of those permitting agencies. What sort of timeline do you think you're looking at now that all these developments have happened? That's in the hands of the agency. However, the executive order made it very clear, and I know it's a personal wish of the president, that we see this resource in production during his 47th term. Of course, we are good users. We've spent the last 14 years getting ready for this moment. We've been able to put in front of them a very well-baked application. We've spent more than $600 million carrying out the research, both from the commercialization, commercial recovery system, and the environmental studies. We've really given them a fully-baked application, and we're hoping that we may hear news on that certainly much sooner than people expect, and certainly in 2025. When I first imagined all this, thinking about how far away some of these resources are from the places where they might be processed, thinking about how deep they are in the ocean, and not knowing much about the technology, my first kind of suspicion is, this sounds expensive. Can you tell me about the economics of this? How it compares to mining on the land, and whether this all kind of fits into prices today? Some of these materials are not necessarily at their historic highs. This resource offers many advantages. One of them is the high grade. It's often grade that is the real driver of the economics. It's polymetallic, so it's very high grades of nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese, plus a heap of rare earths. We're not focused on them in the early days due to the processing method we're using, but in the future we will. If we think about copper, because that's the metal that most people are familiar with. While our resource has 1.1% copper, if we go and put the nickel, cobalt, and manganese into copper equivalent, it's well over 7% copper equivalent. Last year, the average grade of copper mined was about 0.6 of 1%. We're talking about an order of magnitude higher grade. That has a big impact in the amount of revenue we generate per ton of material. What people often forget is, what happens in mining is you have to invest an enormous amount in infrastructure. It might be because the resource sits buried underground, could be a kilometer, it could be four kilometers. I've been to some of the deposits in South Africa where they've spent seven years building shafts to get to the ore body. You've also got to build roads, and railway lines, and perhaps deep water ports, and places for people to live, and water systems, and everything else that goes with the development of a big resource. We don't have those same challenges. We have other challenges, of course, but we don't have those. That has a massive impact on the economics because it means that we can convert a production vessel and sail it on out there and be in production days later. It means that the scale opportunities for us are tremendous as well. It means we put more boats out there. It means that we can take advantage of existing, already built, and permitted processing facilities in various places around the world, such as we announced we're planning to do up in Japan. The intention is to build this infrastructure in the United States. Of course, an abundant supply of energy is a really important ingredient. America has it, and the administration is very focused on having more of it with some of the initiatives that they've announced because abundant, affordable energy is absolutely one of the key drivers to prosperity, and we're going to need a fair bit of it. There's been some environmental critics of deep sea mining. The other day, I saw a release out saying that there's a threatened whale species in the area. I believe a lot of the criticism has been around perhaps the unknowns of what happens when we begin industrial activities in these areas. Can you just tell me a little bit about the metals company's own work to try to mitigate some of these things and maybe your reaction to some of these studies? Look, it's the environmental angle that is probably one of the strongest aspects to support the development of ocean metals. If we go back to first principles, it makes sense that we carry out extractive industries in parts of the planet where there is the least life, not the most life. If you look at the amount of living biomass in the abyssal zone, we're talking about less than 10 grams of living matter per square meter, and most of that is single-cell organisms living in the sediment, about 75 to 80 percent of it. So it begins with the fact that there's not a lot of life there to impact in the first instance. But that still doesn't mean it's not important, and that's why we've been studying about what the impact will be. Will we actually disturb or will we actually help productivity in that area? And there are some signs that will be the case with some species because it's an area of very low energy, low food. And so we found abundances increasing in nearby areas where we had been down there collecting rocks in our commercial trials in 2022. So when I hear people like Greenpeace talking about potential impacts, they are truly grasping at straws now because we have been focused for the last more than 10 years on understanding those environmental impacts, and we've engaged 20 of the world's leading institutions. They've carried out the research. We funded, of course, but it all filled all channels back into an integrated environmental impact study where we look at a whole range of impacts. We look at the pelagic impacts and the midwater column and the benthic impacts, the sediment plume, and how fast a recovery rates and sediment plume is one classic example. And when I say sediment, think of it as driving your car down a dirt track. You'll kick up some dust. The question is how much and how far will it travel? And people like Greenpeace would argue that it's going to travel for thousands of kilometers. Our studies, which we sit alongside people like MIT, who've also published peer-reviewed studies, shows that down in the abyssal plain, the sediment, because we take in the nodules in the front of the machine, we separate the sediment and we spit that out the back, and it creates its own turbidity current. And it only rises two to three meters above the seafloor, and up to 98% of it settles in the area of impact. So contrary to the speculation from desktop studies, when you go out and gather real in-field data, they provide you the answers. And the answers are that the sediment plume doesn't travel those very large distances. It stays very localized. And so my answer to people with environmental concerns is it's reasonable to have them. And of course, our approach has been to address all of those, and the results of those many hundreds of millions of dollars that we've invested. And on top of that, many other contractors have invested since the 1970s. And for your American listeners, NOAA put together a programmatic environmental impact study, which was the work of four EISs done by contractors, plus their own work, which they submitted to Congress in 1995. And it basically showed that subject to more studies on the plume, which we have now done, there was no risk of causing serious harm in collecting nodules from the abyssal plain. Our work has further studied that and come up with the same findings. And we also have to remember that nothing has zero impact. But when you look at the two ecosystems, and you think about the abyssal plains and hills, which account for 50% of our entire planet, so it's the most common environment, there's no alternative use for it. You can't grow things there. People can't live there. It seems to be a perfect place to be carrying out this activity. Because today, where we're getting our nickel from is from tropical rainforest. And the problem with that is you've got to move all of the people who live in them out. You've got to tear down the rainforest and all of the biodiversity and biomass that is in it. And then you've got to dig up the soil where the metal-bearing ore is contained. And that's the beginning of the impacts. Then you have spillage into the oceans and rivers. And honestly, it's such a clear use case to be picking up rocks and turning them into these important base metals compared to the land-based alternatives. Excellent. And the last time we were talking, you were looking at permitting, I believe, for the International Seabed Authority. Can you maybe give our listeners just a little bit of background about that organization and why we're now hearing about you applying through the U.S. instead? Maybe give us a little bit of background on how that came to shift around. Yeah, sure. So in 2001, we applied for our first exploration license under the International Seabed Authority. And in 2012, our second one. So first was with Nauru, the other was the Kingdom of Tonga. And if we look at this industry, it almost got started back in the 70s. And then the United Nations got involved and a number of countries decided that the best way to approach this would be to agree a treaty for a number of countries. And there are now 169 member countries who have signed that treaty. There are more than 20 who have not. And of course, the most notable one who have not is the United States of America. And the U.S. from the very beginning said, we don't agree with this approach. We're not going to sign the treaty. We're not going to abide by those rules because no sovereign has ownership over the oceans. Every nation has freedom of movement, freedom of passage rights. They have access to the minerals on the seafloor. They have access to be able to lay cables on the seafloor. And what America did is stood aside, said, we still want to maintain those rights. The other countries who did sign UNCLOS, as I say, there's 169 of them now, said, well, when it comes to minerals, when it comes to metals on the seafloor, we're going to be bound by these rules. Now, in 1994, the International Seabed Authority was established and it had a very clear mandate. It had to put in place exploration and exploitation regulations to allow the commercialization of these resources. While protecting the marine environment. And so in 2001, they put in place the exploration rules. But here we are 2025 and there are still no rules that cover commercial production. And the main reason for that is that the system got overtaken by NGOs. And so the process was slowed down. Some bad actors became more vocal and they just used the process of delay. Now, at the same time, the United States in 1980 adopted a set of rules. We know them as DSHMRA and they're administered by NOAA, the federal agency, which allowed for exploration and also for commercial recovery. And so we made a decision in the second half of last year that's subject to a number of things. And one of them was getting a strong government in place that we would change our permitting strategy and apply through our U.S. subsidiary, TMC USA. And that's what we're moving forward with. And obviously, the United States are very clear on their rights over these metals. They've held two exploration areas in the CCZ, in the very same area that were granted to Lockheed Martin, and they've been in place for a long time. But it was really the president's focus on reindustrialization, their absolute focus on how to secure supply chain certainty that gave us the confidence that this resource could play a very important role in helping fulfill America's future ambitions. And while the support has come from President Trump, we do see it as a bipartisan issue. We had good support from the previous administration as well, certainly not the strong leadership we're seeing from this one, but we think the critical mineral challenge is one that will not go away. It will only become more important. And I think that for the last couple of years, we've been all talking about bits. We've been talking about AI and these new industries. And of course, what people are now starting to realize is that the atoms are super important because we need to build all the infrastructure to supply the energy to enable this to happen and to supply the industry to attract jobs back into the United States. And so it's an exciting time. And we're delighted with the support we're getting from this administration. And we're just, we're delighted at the prospect that we can get this resource into production on a short timeline. And now related to that, you know, I'm always curious of whether the market is, is that they're following these trends closely enough to know what's going on. And I think it took a while for people to kind of realize the importance of critical minerals, right? But you've recently announced a $37 million investment from Hess Capital, I believe it was an $85 million investment from Korea Zinc into the metals company. Can you tell me a little bit about, first of all, the significance of those investments, but also maybe how have you seen the kind of market evolve and its reception of critical minerals and understanding its importance to, let's say, energy transition? Well, you're right to suggest that people have been a little bit slow on the uptake on the importance of critical minerals, but they are getting it now. We wanted to focus the business more and more on the USA. And so we were delighted to see Michael Hess. And in fact, we announced Alex Spiro to join our board only a week ago. And of course the Hess family are very well known industrialists in the USA. And so to have them commit a very sizable piece of capital behind this idea from their family office was a really important initiative because they help manage some of the stakeholders who are going to be very, very important. And they've got an amazing track record of building globally successful companies. And I'm sure some of that will rub off onto our efforts, and it already has. This is not a passive investment. This is an investment, which I imagine they'll probably invest more in the future if the opportunity arises. But what we're seeing at the moment is lots of effort to help us achieve what our corporate goals are. And of course, Careers Inc. is similar. We've known that company, well, we've known the company for decades, but we've had good dialogue going for the last year. And their chairman is very committed to exploring how they can access more USA opportunity. And from our perspective, they are, outside of China, the only company that we think can help fast track what we want to put on the ground in the United States. And they bring expertise, clearly they bring capital, but it's that expertise which will enable us to move a whole lot faster and with much less risk than we would otherwise be able to. And we have an enormous amount of inbound inquiry coming our way these days. Since we announced at the end of March that our permitting pathway would be USA focused, people see that there's some certainty now about us being able to secure a permit to be able to go and develop this enormous resource. One thing I haven't mentioned, Taylor, is we know we've got a defined 1.6 billion tons on the areas that we've applied for through the US government. And we estimate with some other ground that we've added to the application, there's another half a billion tons. We're talking well over 2 billion tons of nodules sitting on the seafloor that are polymetallic. But if we put them into copper grade, they're more than 7% copper equivalent. There is no other resource on the planet that fits into that category. And so having strong partners who can help us develop this asset in the same way that we have all seas is one of our most important partners who are experts in the offshore industry. And it was their flawless execution that enabled us to run those commercial trials so well in 2022, because for the past 40 years, they've been solving very complex production issues in the deep ocean. They lay pipe 24 hours a day, 365 days a year when they're on production. And so they bring all of that learnings and all of that know-how to help us avoid making mistakes that early stage companies would otherwise make. And we see Careers Inc. and the Hess family coming to help us do that to an even greater degree. So a lot of reasons to be excited over the metals company. To wrap it up, my last question for you is, what are maybe some of the challenges that you see in the horizon in 2025? What are your maybe biggest hurdles that you're looking to face in the next couple of months? Well, we're going to be depending on getting this permit on the commercial recovery, of course. But we absolutely want to get focused on building that infrastructure in the USA. We're very encouraged by the administration's support that they've been offering us on how to get processing quickly permitted. Of course, I don't have to worry about capital so much now, because not only do we have access to lots of capital on the balance sheet, we'll close the quarter with more cash than we've ever had in the bank. I think the pro forma number we gave was about $120 million. So that's a good feeling. But of course, capital management is one of those things that we've proven to be pretty good at. But we've now got more expertise around the table. And the Hess family helped with that, of course. Alex Ferro brings an enormous amount of expertise in that area as well. So we're very happy to have his services available to us as to Careers Inc. But managing that capital so that our equity holders get the best return on their invested capital is always of the highest priority for me. Our shareholders have been amazing to support us. We're enjoying building a strong retail support base as we are welcoming institutions. If you look at the forms that have been filed now, you see some of the world's biggest institutions turning up on our share registry. I think providing we continue to show them that we look after their capital, then we'll continue to see that group of institutional owners grow and grow. So it's going to be an exciting little run-in into first production. And we've been at this for 14 years. And we're just grateful for the fact that President Trump and his administration is clearing a pathway to help us make this happen quickly.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-06-24\n==================================================\n\n### How resource protectionism is influencing the energy transition\n**Episode ID:** 5066\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985683\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Energy Evolution, a Platts Podcast brought to you by S&P Global Commodity Insights, where we explore the pivotal moments and trends shaping our energy future. I'm your host, Eklavya Gupte, and today we're diving into a critical topic that lies at the intersection of geopolitics and energy, resource protectionism and its profound implications for the energy transition. Now, we're just about halfway through 2025 and it's glaringly clear that the energy markets have experienced a tumultuous journey marked by volatility and uncertainty. From tariffs imposed on essential goods to a surge in global conflicts, escalating trade tensions are prompting significant shifts in the pace of the energy transition. With many nations resorting to protectionist policies, the global rollout of renewable energy technologies faces significant headwinds, according to many analysts and policy makers. But others are of the view that this trend in resource nationalism is actually quite bullish for the energy transition. Many fossil fuel importing countries in particular are looking to diversify their energy sources to tap more renewables, something Europe in particular has experienced in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now joining me in this episode is James Burgess, who covers the energy transition beat in the Platts News team. Welcome, James. I know you've been closely following the impact on renewables from recent events this year. So how are tariffs and the ongoing economic and political uncertainty driving energy policies for many countries and companies? Well, it's no surprise that clean energy tech has not been immune to some of these macroeconomic trends and the geopolitical scenarios that we're seeing at the moment. There's everything from critical minerals, batteries, renewables and carbon capture. And all these are dependent on global supply chains, as well as investment decisions from developers in a widespread geography. And it really does depend on sector and geography. So we've seen Europe is really blazing a trail, forging ahead with its green energy transition. It's reframing that in terms of national security and energy affordability. And that's something we'll come on to in a bit. If we look at the US under the Trump administration, there's been a clear pullback from supportive policies for renewables. And the Trump administration has effectively scrapped a lot of subsidies and incentives for renewable energy. We've seen major uncertainty and cancellations for wind projects and hydrogen projects. A lot of developers, investors are pulling back or pausing decisions. If we look at Asia, China, for example, is looking to gain market share in emerging clean technology areas, from solar panels, as we've seen over the last decade or so, to emerging electrolyzer technology and other energy transition areas. They're also supplying their own expanding energy demand with renewables. And even fossil fuel rich regions such as the Middle East see opportunities there, with countries looking to diversify into such things as green hydrogen and ammonia, largely targeting export markets. Thanks, James. But at the same time, we have quite a few headwinds. Many energy companies, particularly the big oil and gas firms, are shelving or exiting from renewable projects. And we also see some governments applying some brakes on their energy and climate goals. So you're right, there's significant headwinds in the clean energy technology space. Supply chains have been disrupted massively, first of all, from the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine war with Russia's invasion. And now we're seeing trade tensions and tariffs disrupt supply chains of critical minerals, of components, all of these in markets that are globalised in their nature. There's also been a period of high interest rates and cost inflation that's impacting policies from renewable hydrogen to offshore wind, with developers having to revisit budgets and expectations around costs in a rapidly moving environment. And there's still delays in implementing some of the policy that we've talked about. Even within Europe, there's still sectors where project developers and companies are becoming quite impatient for governments to deliver on some of the financing they've committed. Now that's starting to trickle through and we're seeing projects start to get built across the clean energy space. I mentioned it is sector specific. So there's clearly booming demand for critical minerals and components for things like solar panels, wind turbines, other raw materials, but there's still cost concerns and policy frameworks are causing some delays in sectors such as offshore wind and hydrogen. Having said that, some see the momentum behind the energy transition as unstoppable. And while there could be short term setbacks and delays, longer term path has been set to a switch to renewables and low carbon energy. Thanks James. Now James spoke with two experts to get a varied perspective on how recent events were impacting the pace of the energy transition. First, he spoke to Dan Klein, who is the head of Future Energy Pathways at S&P Global Commodity Insights. And Dan observes how many countries have had to modify and adapt their energy strategies to navigate these geopolitical shifts. Hi Dan, welcome to the podcast. It's great to be with you, James. So we're going to dive into some themes around the energy transition and how resource protectionism and nationalism are impacting some of the investments and projects there. Now we've seen a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other trade measures. How are these recent global events impacting the rollout of renewables and the energy transition? Current events have been broadly worrying about the rollout of renewables and the energy transition. Supply chains of many things, but of clean energy technology in particular, have become so globalized with inputs and finished goods crossing national borders several times before their final usage. So the exposure there to tariffs and potential trade tariffs and the uncertainty there really raises their costs and raises questions about the investment environment to make those investments in those technologies. And this is particularly the case of the trade war with China. It's hard to overstate how crucial China is in this space. From production of rare minerals and their refining, the manufacturing of solar panels, EV components, hydrogen electrolyzers, all of those things, China really dominates in this space. And so increased tariffs on imports or components of these finished goods will have direct increase of costs of clean energy technologies, and that can really impact the competitiveness with other forms of energy use and fossil fuel use in particular. And would you say the pace of the energy transition is stalling as well as these increased costs and supply chains? I don't know if I would go so far as to say the energy transition is stalling, but there's just been some political pushback on energy transition and decarbonization goals of late. And again, once again, this is highlighted by the US and the Trump administration. It has really not been shy about its feelings about renewables and broader clean energy technologies and just the announcing proposals to remove the subsidies and support mechanisms. At the same time, the sort of weakness in oil and gas prices has a knock-on effect from trade tariffs and slowing economic growth, and it weakens the economic incentives to switch to an EV, for example. But it's tempting to get lost in the headlines here, that there are prevailing factors that are getting factored into all of our outlooks that we're putting out across our scenarios. In my role in the scenarios team, I can tell you that there are a few aspects about that future that we're building into each and every one of the scenarios, which have a pretty wide range of energy futures. And one of the biggest ones here is China's clean energy push. So for a variety of reasons, China has made this energy transition the centerpiece of its economy in the 21st century. And the amount of wind and solar that is being added in China every year is just staggering. It added over 200 gigawatts of capacity in 2024 alone, almost 300 gigawatts to be fair. And on top of this, one in every two cars sold in China is essentially an EV at this point. And so there's a massive number of that is going into China's big market, and it's the biggest market in the world for these types of things. And so when you look at what's going on in China, you can have very strong feelings about the energy transition that's happening globally, and just in its dominance of energy markets in particular. But what's happening in the US certainly is worrying for a broader energy transition concerns. Because if this sort of protectionism and feeling that decarbonisation is not a higher priority, that is certainly worrying. And if this sort of bolsters the US economy, there could be other economies out there around the world that see a deregulatory pathway or focusing on lower cost fossil fuels could be the passport and that could spread to other markets. I think that's an interesting aspect of the current geopolitics. There's been a growing focus on energy security from a lot of energy importing countries. And with that comes a drive in some sectors and thinking of Europe in particular, for homegrown power, and in particular renewables. So I was wondering if you can give us a sense of, is this focus on energy security and homegrown renewables, bullish or bearish for energy transition? Energy security is a term that can apply to a lot of different things. And I think if you're talking about the push for energy security, domestically renewables, I think that's generally bullish for the energy transition. But I think if you're thinking about energy security in a broader sense that looking to that can apply to fossil fuel oriented countries where fossil fuel use production is key to the domestic industry, and that is something that might want to be protected and building domestic production. So the drill baby drill mantra in the US is certainly part of that in that aspect. So there is it's a really complicated issue. And it's one that we're focusing on all our scenarios. This idea of energy security is the build of that is not going away. But as you say, in places like Europe, or especially in smaller maybe island nations like Japan, where there's not a lot of fossil fuel resources that go into place, building renewables, whether you import the renewables from China or anywhere else, or you're building up all that infrastructure domestically, that certainly insulates you from swings in oil markets, LG markets, and all those types of things. So those incentives are certainly staying in place, particularly as renewables are the lowest cost form of new power generation that can go into the market right now. So no matter what happens with geopolitics, is that sort of guiding star principles being there is that if you need to build new power, renewables is the lowest cost solution. It's interesting, we're seeing a different picture emerge in different parts of the globe, depending on how their economies are oriented around different energy sources about the energy sources available. And we touched on this at the beginning, but I was wondering how you see energy transition investments and projects impacted by the growing protectionism that we're seeing globally. Similarly, I think it's a complicated issue. But on balance, I think it's an additional barrier that the energy transition has to overcome to see an acceleration to the places that most people feel that it needs to go. This goes back to the idea that the modern economy is built on relatively free trade, where goods are made from inputs sourced from around the world. And the modern economy in the 21st century is not nationalized there, we're not building and using everything that's just made in a certain country, and underscores that trilemma that we've often heard about before balancing energy security, sustainability and affordability. And while we've talked about how there can be overlap in these areas, so often domestic concerns, short term concerns can overrule those factors for energy sustainability. But really, the uncertainty of all this that's happening, it's not necessarily there are there are tariffs in place, it's that there could be very wide ranging of tariffs, not knowing if you're going to have to pay a 20% tariff or 100% tariff makes pretty uncertain market conditions. And especially considering that a lot of these clean energy technologies are so initially capitally intensive, and they can have very low variable costs going forward. Having that certainty upfront is certainly important. And there's different ways to agree with that in the US, the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act was trying to do this upfront where to build up domestic clean energy technologies, but that's sort of been weakened in this recent Trump administration. So it seems there's an awful lot of headwinds facing the sector, at least in the shorter term. Do you see any bright spots for energy transition in the current climate? I think this again, once goes back to what's going on in China, I think we, those of us in the Western world get so focused on what's happening in the US and Europe, and even Europe is seeming a little bit less ambitious about its climate goals. But the amount of new clean tech that's going into place year after year in China is incredible. The largest car market in the world is becoming more electrified than is using internal combustion engines in terms of new sales. So these types of things are moving forward. And as China goes, so goes the world. So if you're looking at what's happening in a global fleet perspective, global sales are ticking up into the 20, 30% of new cars being electrified. China is getting to its peak coal in terms of its demand, and that means the world is getting to its peak coal demand. It's right at or past its peak of gasoline and diesel. And so these types of milestones are really important. And it kind of really underscores of where we go from here. Are we going to be see a sharper peak, a sharper reduction from those peaks globally? Or are things like resource protectionism, trade tariffs, all those things going to really blunt those factors going forward? Or can we see a future where decarbonisation accelerates? And just turning to Europe for a moment, how do you see the prospects there? Because it's been incredibly exposed to fossil fuels and a major importer, especially of Russian gas up until the invasion of Ukraine. And we've seen that as a big policy driver to shift away from fossil fuels and Russian gas in particular. You mentioned politics, there's a lot of political pressure on various parties across Europe to step back from some of the environmental and green policies. But at the same time, there is this continued narrative of pushing renewables and energy transition. How do you see the balance of energy sources there in the next few years? I think policymakers are looking for that word. They're looking for balance. And with an uncertain future, needing to make sure they're not putting all eggs in one basket. So I think obviously, in a long term situation, if you have the installed capacity to use so much more renewables, your exposure to swings in prices and demand or geopolitical concerns like the cutoff of Russian gas into Europe become less of an issue. But at the same time, looking to build up LNG import infrastructure and other sorts of ways to sort of have backup plans or at least to a bridge to get to that future where it's more driven by renewables and being able to not be exposed to that. So especially in this sort of period of uncertainty, having a diverse strategy of doing both things at the same time is probably what a lot of policymakers are looking at. And then finally, look in particular at fossil fuel importers. How do you see them positioning themselves regarding the energy transition? Are they doubling down on a turn to renewables to try and move on to the new technology? Or are they focusing on further fossil fuel imports? There's probably different categories of fossil fuel importers that are having different strategies. If there is a country that maybe not is looking for incremental growth of energy demand, mature economies, this is where growth of renewables can chip away at your existing need for energy and that will just chip away at fossil fuels. But if you're in a growing economy, the decisions are a lot more complex. Do you need to build a new natural gas distribution network to handle incremental natural gas if you feel like your growth of energy demand is that much larger going to be according to LNG? Or is it something where you feel relatively confident about new renewables meeting at least incremental energy demand growth and not needing to build that infrastructure? Because you're thinking about how much infrastructure needs to be able to be very expensive, it can last for decades. And so there's a lot of concerns about stranded assets out there. So there's diverse strategies amongst countries about what they're doing, depending on their growth profile for overall energy demand. Thanks very much for joining us. It's a pleasure, James. We also spoke with Society General's Global Head of Commodity Strategy, Ben Hoff. Now, Ben is very much of the view that the narrative around energy transition is moving solely away from environmental considerations, but towards energy security and sovereignty. So I'd like to start with talking about fossil fuel importing countries. How are they positioning themselves regarding the energy transition? Are countries doubling down on renewables or focusing on securing more fossil fuel imports? First of all, James, thanks so much for having me. Lovely to be here. And I think that's really a very pertinent and timely question. I think in short, it really depends on the country you're looking at. Part of the world is obviously fossil fuel rich, less of a question for them. The other part of the world, which is really what we're focused on here, are countries that are fossil fuel poor. And indeed, the focus of the energy transition in these fossil fuel poor countries has really always been as much about saving carbon molecules as it's been about facilitating energy independence through the transition. So what I would say is that for that latter group of countries, the countries that are net importers of fossil fuels, the urgency to become more energy independent, less dependent on fossil fuels, has, if anything, increased. And I think that's really going to be a theme that we're going to see play out over the coming years. And another aspect, a macroeconomic aspect of the energy transition in recent years, and especially the last few months, we've seen very strong concerns around recession or potential economic downturns, partly driven by the Trump administration tariffs and other supply chain issues. How do you see that playing into the drive to energy transition when certain countries and regions are struggling with economic growth and looking at a less certain outcome? Yeah, well, look, I think that's a really good question, James. Truth be told, any form of infrastructure development and energy infrastructure development is no exception. There is massively capital impacts. So the difference between 7% interest rates and 3% interest rates is ultimately the driver of economic viability of changing that infrastructure and putting in place new projects, new renewable projects. So to me, that's one of the major feedback loops where rates just do play a massive role and really determine the difference between economically viable and economically non-viable, probably more so even than just pure recession or recession fears. The reason I say that is because at this point, maybe aside from the US and the change of administration here, but to a large extent, the die has been set for the energy transition, at least in the rest of the world outside of the US to continue a pace, largely because it is, to a significant extent, publicly funded, or at least in partnership publicly funded. But that's where rates come in. And when you have rates that are just double what they were five years ago, that really changes the economics of a lot of those projects quite significantly. And are there any concrete examples you can point to where there has been a doubling down on transition renewables in light of increasing resource nationalism and protectionism? Working for a French bank, there's obviously no way I couldn't talk about France basically becoming significant nuclear energy provider in the 1970s. And that is, I think, actually a very successful example of what can be achieved through arguably a level of protectionism. When you look at Pierre Messina, who was the Prime Minister in 1974, pretty much came up with a plan that single-handedly turned France from not being the producer of any nuclear energy in the early 1970s to nuclear being 75% of its electricity consumption by the mid-1990s. That obviously all played out against the background of a highly protected local energy infrastructure. The fact that, yeah, they did get an initial design from Westinghouse, but ultimately protected the evolution of that design, all things that were ultimately protectionist measures to some extent. France consumes roughly 67% of its electricity from nuclear, but that has really laid the foundation for reliable integration of renewables into the system. And the net result of this is that amongst all G7 nations, France stands out in that only 3.7% of its electricity is generated by fossil fuels. And that really is possible through this early adoption at scale of nuclear, which one can argue very easily was the result of a successful protectionist policy. So you're saying it's more longer term that the direction has been set, the transition is in motion, the political agenda is set in places like Europe. So regardless of these headwinds, there's still momentum in that direction. Is that a fair characterization? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we've got on the order of $2 trillion of energy transition-related projects either underway or in the pipe that are basically planned out and at least in parts already being implemented. And so that's a wave of projects that's just going to be very difficult to stop dead in its tracks. So will it slow the train? Yes, probably it will slow the train, but ultimately the direction of the train here is set and this train has left the station. So it seems unlikely to me that we're going to see any form of complete reversal here, at least at a global level. Another element of energy transition, and it relates to national spending and how governments and institutions are approaching this. There's been a lot of discussion around the parallels in national security and energy security. I was wondering what your thoughts are on how governments are allocating funding between defence and energy transition. Look, I think there's an increasing realisation that national security and energy independence go hand in hand, that indeed energy independence is part of national security. And so I think that's increasingly the perception, certainly in Europe, when you look at the new German government that just assumed power, the abolition of the debt break in as much as defence-related spending is concerned, together with an infrastructure bill. These are all manifestations of this realisation that defence slash national security and the energy transition go hand in hand. Now that's obviously a lot truer for countries that are fossil fuel poor than it is for countries that are fossil fuel rich. But conceptually, energy is the one, probably the single largest attaining skill of an economy. And that is something that I think really was brought home for Western Europe as a result of the war in Ukraine, where basically, when you look at Germany as probably the leading example, a large chunk of Germany's industrial success from the 1970s onward was funded by the reliable and cheap availability of Russian fossil fuels, notably natural gas via pipeline. And having that suddenly removed as a result of the war in Ukraine really changed the economics in a very significant way for Germany. And it's that realisation that really dawned on politicians, and I think Europeans at large, that if you don't have fossil fuels available locally, you are vulnerable. And really the only vehicle, the only known technological vehicle that these countries have as of now to alleviate these vulnerabilities through the energy transition, maybe not to the point where they become completely energy independent, but where they would use their dependence on fossil fuels to a manageable extent.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-06-17\n==================================================\n\n### Carbon removal technology, markets picking up steam\n**Episode ID:** 5067\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985718\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the Energy Evolution podcast where we explore the critical moments shaping our energy future. I'm your host Eklavya Gupte and in this episode we will be diving deep into the world of carbon removal technologies which is increasingly being viewed as a crucial component in our fight against climate change. However, this sector is still in its infancy, raising important questions about the economic and scientific viability of various technologies. Carbon dioxide removal or greenhouse gas removal or also known as CDR refer to climate mitigation strategies that remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere as opposed to strategies to avoid such emissions. These encompass a wide array of approaches including technology-based methods like direct air capture, biomass carbon removal and storage, enhanced rock weathering, biochar, ocean carbon capture and you also have nature-based removal projects such as afforestation and reforestation. Critics argue that many carbon removal technologies are untested and expensive while proponents say these methods are crucial for companies and countries to reach net zero. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has basically said carbon removal methods are unavoidable if net zero CO2 emissions are to be achieved. The IPCC also said CDR technologies will need to account for around 6 gigatons per year of CO2 globally by 2050. This is roughly equivalent to US annual emissions today. The technology-based removal sector has grown significantly in recent years and the volume tree carbon market has been at the forefront of this. As these removal projects generate carbon credits and the money from these carbon credits are then used to finance these high capital intensive projects. These removal credits which represent the actual removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere differ fundamentally from traditional carbon offsets and from carbon allowances. And these carbon removal tech-based credits also trade at a much higher premium than credits from carbon avoidance projects. For example, removal credits from biochar projects have been averaging around $146 per metric tonne of carbon dioxide for the first five months of 2025. While during the same time period, credits from nature-based projects or nature-based avoidance projects have been averaging around $5.26 per metric tonne, according to Platz prices. In this episode, we will hear from two companies that are making significant strides in the carbon removal space. First, we'll hear from Steve Oldham of Captura, which is a carbon removal startup focused on direct ocean capture. Based in California, Captura captures carbon dioxide directly from seawater for permanent storage or reuse using electrodialysis technology and gas extraction technologies powered by renewable electricity. The company operates around three pilot plants and is looking to scale up direct ocean capture technology for widespread commercial deployment. Hello Steve, welcome to Energy Evolution. To start off with, it would be good if you could give us a quick intro on ocean-based carbon removal and what makes it different from some of the other carbon removal technologies. Sure, happy to do so. Firstly, we need to remember that the carbon removal problem is absolutely enormous. The sector needs to scale to the size of the oil and gas industry today, but do so in about half the time. So, Captura's approach, which is an ocean-based approach, says the ocean is the largest carbon removal device on the planet. It covers, as we know, 70% of the surface of the ocean. It's doing carbon removal for us on a massive scale every single day. But it's doing so at significant cost to the ocean, so the oceans are becoming more acidic. This is what's leading to blanching of the coral reefs, for example, rising ocean temperatures, which leads to extreme weather events. So, what Captura seeks to do is say, if the ocean is this really large, really effective carbon removal device, is there a way that we can leverage that to remove atmospheric carbon and help reverse the current very bad trend in climate? So, that's the fundamental principle of ocean-based carbon removal. There are different technologies within ocean-based carbon removal. Captura, which is the company that I'm the CEO of, we do one called Direct Ocean Capture, but there are other forms of ocean-based carbon removal as well. Okay, thanks. And can you tell us a little bit about what makes it commercially viable and why has it not taken off just yet? Yeah. So, firstly, carbon removal as a whole is a very nascent sector. There have been carbon removal companies around for about 15 years, but really, carbon removal was very quiet and very small until about 2018. In 2018, the IPCC came out with their first report, the first time said, we are not doing emission reduction fast enough, we have a legacy volume of CO2 in the atmosphere, and because we're not removing or stopping emissions fast enough, we need to do carbon removal. It was the first time that, if you like, the body of science turned around and said, carbon removal is an essential part of the fight against climate change. So, the whole sector really only took off in 2018. I remember in 2018, I testified to the US Senate Commission, and at the time I said, there's probably less than 200 people in the world working on carbon removal. Happy to say that's changed a lot since, which is good. So, carbon removal is new. Ocean-based carbon removal is even newer. It's really only in the last three years where solutions that can utilize the ocean, leverage this natural ability of the ocean to capture carbon, have come into reality. Still at the pilot stage, mostly, but now ready to start moving into deployment. So, if you think of the timescale of direct air capture, for example, companies in direct air capture really started in 2018 to expand. So, they've probably got three, four years on ocean-based carbon removal, but we're catching up fast. Yeah, no, thank you. And it'd be good to find out a little bit about your new plans, because I know you all just signed a supply deal with Japan's Mitsui OSK lines, and you have Equinox that's helping you with a lot of your projects. Yes, certainly. The approach we've taken at Captura is we want to prove that our process is benign to the ocean, it's ocean safe and ocean healthy, and we want to prove all of our key technology is fully operational, working at the performance levels we require. So, for us, we were founded in late 2021, so just over three and a bit years ago, and that's been the focus of the company to the start of this year. We have a fully operational pilot plant in Hawaii. It demonstrates all of the key parameters of our technology operating at the performance levels we expect. So, now we're starting to move to commercialization. Started that process with our first offtake with a mall group, a Japanese maritime transportation company. So, they've bought carbon credits off us. We're in discussion with several other parties, and we're really ready to build our first large commercial plant. We think our solution is really scalable. The reason we say that, first, we use the ocean. Ocean's already there. It's already really big. The second, we have no input material and no waste products. So, that matters if you're trying to build a massive industrial sector from scratch. If you don't have to worry about supply chain for your material, and you don't have to worry about how to deal with waste product, that's a big advantage. So, one of the key parts of Captura's system is the fact that, yeah, no input material, no waste material. It's a closed-loop system. And obviously, in a lot of carbon removal technologies, there are some people who are still naysayers or detractors. What would you say to them? Because some people say some of these technologies are unproven and quite expensive as well. So, it'd be good to get your view on how to do that. Yeah, and of course, they're absolutely correct. This is a nascent industry. But if we said that to every new technology coming up, we wouldn't have computers, electric cars. We wouldn't have all these good things that we enjoy in society today. I always tell people that I think carbon removal is absolutely essential. And the reason I think it's so essential is I don't see a feasible path for us to get to eliminating all emissions anytime soon. So, it's in everybody's interest, in my opinion, to facilitate as many good ideas and solutions as we can in this sector. And the strong ones will play out. That's the law of economics. The good solutions will be the ones that survive, the ones that are scalable, sustainable, and low-cost. We think we'll be one of them. And you obviously mentioned you have these pilot plants. I think there's two in California and one in Hawaii. Correct me if I'm wrong. But it'd be good to find out what are your next steps? We're ready and now preparing to build our first commercial plants. I think the first commercial plant will be about 50,000 tons per year. Our technology is fully modular and scalable. There's really no limit to the physical size. We obviously require an ocean location, require ocean water. So, we look at three phases of deployment. The first phase is use existing shore-based infrastructure that moves ocean water, the desalination industry, power plants that use water for cooling. Our process can sit in parallel. We don't change the nature of the water. We don't change its chemistry. We just pull the CO2 out. And then, of course, the atmosphere puts it back. So, that's a good first step for us. Step two would be existing ocean-based infrastructure. So, oil and gas platforms that reach end-of-life, ocean-going vessels that are no longer economic. They're floating platforms. We can convert them into capture plants. And then, the last phase would be dedicated platforms that we would build into the ocean, floating platforms. The water moves underneath. We're able to capture the CO2 from it as it moves underneath us. So, in total, we are very comfortable with being able to do at least a billion tons using our technology. And there's really no limit on the scaling. So, hopefully, that can help with the climate problem. Scientists estimate we need about 7 to 10 billion tons of removal per year. And I also wanted to ask about, you said your technology is quite different from some of the other technologies in terms of ocean-based carbon removal. So, just to find out, what are the big differences between the technologies? Yeah. At a high level, there are three approaches to ocean-based carbon removal. The first is to use biomass. So, have biomass into the ocean. Sink it to the bottom of the ocean. It absorbs CO2. And then, by sinking it to the bottom of the ocean, the biomass stays there. Another example is ocean alkalinity enhancement. That's where you add alkalinity into the ocean. And when you do so, that creates a reaction. The ocean then absorbs CO2 into the ocean out of the atmosphere. So, the ocean ends up with a higher level of CO2. The atmosphere has less. And by doing so, you then absorb that into the deep ocean. And so, you've effectively stored CO2. Our approach, direct ocean capture, physically removes the CO2 out of the ocean. And that creates a drawdown from the atmosphere. I want to take just 30 seconds to explain that process in a very simple metaphor, which is a can of Coke. So, if you buy a can of soda, Coke, beer, champagne, whatever you like, it's fizzy. The reason it's fizzy, we all like a fizzy drink, is it's got CO2 in it. So, when you open the can of soda, and you pour it into a glass, and you leave it on the table, you see these bubbles come up. And as you wait, the glass of soda goes flat. The reason it does is because of Henry's Law. Henry's Law says there has to be an equilibrium between the ocean and the atmosphere with respect to CO2. Applies to a can of Coke, too. So, those bubbles that you see coming up in the can of Coke, that's CO2 being extracted by the atmosphere because there's too much CO2 in the Coke. So, what Captura does is we reverse that process. Imagine us taking CO2 out of the can of Coke, the ocean. By doing so, you create the opposite effect, and the atmosphere puts it back. So, I think the differentiation for direct ocean capture compared to other solutions, we produce a stream of CO2. It's measurable, it's visible, it can be utilized to make synthetic fuels sequestered underground. We also have no input material and no waste products. So, we don't require a supply chain of absorbents or chemicals. Everything we do, it comes from the ocean itself and renewable electricity, and we produce no waste. Thank you. That was really a good analogy. Really appreciate your time, and thanks very much. Next, we hear from Han William Bode, president of Puro.Earth, which is one of the most significant players in the removal credits market. Puro.Earth is a carbon removal registry focused on science or tech-based removal credits. It created the Puro standard, which is the world's first carbon standard for engineered carbon removals. Welcome, Han William, to Energy Evolution. Thank you very much for your time today. Maybe to kick off, it'd be good to get a little bit of an intro on Puro.Earth, and obviously, you have recently taken over as president. So, a bit about your vision for the registry and also for carbon removals. Yeah, thank you, and thanks very much for inviting me to be here. It's great. Puro.Earth was founded about five years ago or so, basically with the idea to become one of the leading registries in the removal space. It was the first one in those days, and if you look back, basically, there was an extreme focus on innovation, because basically, you're developing a new product in a market that is still pretty innovative. And also, you're focusing on technologies where the science is still developing and evolving. So, what that means is that you do need to have a very agile and innovative approach to actually building a business like that. The whole purpose of Puro.Earth is to create trust in the engineered removal market by making sure that what we issue are really high-quality engineered removal credits, CORCs. And I think that is exactly what we set out to do. It's not just providing registry service, because basically, everybody who's active in this ecosystem right now is actually shaping and developing a market. And I think that is exactly what we've been focused on as Puro. We've managed to achieve that when we issued a cumulative one million tons of these removal credits. And I've got a history in carbon credits that goes back to the early 2000s, working on projects mainly in India and China in those days. And what the real challenge is for me here is that you're operating in an environment where there are questions around integrity of carbon markets. And focusing on engineered removals is actually looking at a segment where you really can show much more clearly than a lot of other segments that integrity and quality are front of mind all the time. That's what is exciting about it. And as Puro.Earth, where we are, is basically we built the foundations over the last five years, not just for the firm, but to a very large extent also for the carbon removal market as a whole. And now we're getting into that beautiful growth phase. And despite the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. Thank you. And you mentioned that carbon removals, because of the embrace of technology and science, it's maybe easier to show some of the high quality of the carbon credits. But we know that this market has suffered a bit of a confidence crisis recently because of increased scrutiny. So how is Puro.Earth managing this? Yeah. So I think if you focus on engineered removal specifically, because there is often technology involved, it is much easier to actually quantify the exact amount of emission reductions that have been achieved. And especially if you focus on the more mature technologies. So when you talk about more mature technologies like biochar, which has to date been quite a large chunk of the credits that have been issued onto our registry, it's pretty clear from if you start looking at output, how much CO2 has actually been captured and sequestered. I think when it comes to quality, and the quality question is different when you talk about technologies that are a bit less mature. And there it is all about being extremely transparent and conservative. So being extremely transparent about the assumptions you make about the status of the science, and at the same time, being extremely clear about the requirements on monitoring and verification. So when you actually combine a focus on quality, the status of the technology from a science point of view, and a rigid focus on monitoring verification and the likes, then you actually do get into a mindset of making sure that quality is at the core of the thinking in this market. And I think that is absolutely critical. And so there's a whole lot of problems that you have in other carbon parts of the credit markets, you don't have an engineered removals. But then at the same time, you've got the uncertainty about the science and status of the science in some of these technologies. And I think transparency is just absolutely critical. Not try to, for lack of a better word, fluff things, but just be open and transparent about your assumptions. And also be aware that when science develops, requirements for monitoring and verification develop, and you need to update your methodologies in line with the development of the market and the development of the science. So for me, that's the core thing is like being super transparent about the assumptions you make. Thank you. And one question was regarding obviously, we have seen some positive developments in this space in terms of buyer demand. One thing is obviously the big techs embrace of carbon removals. So it would be good to get your point of view on that. And do you see that demand broadening to not just the big technology players? Yeah, so I think, so there's a couple of things that have happened. Tech players have often been at the forefront of new developments and have embraced new developments. And engineered removals is one of those areas where people can get very excited about, because it is new, because it is innovative, and because of the quality points we were just discussing. And I think that is one of the main reasons why big tech has embraced it very early on. So for example, if you look at the most recent SBTI consultation, the two main messages coming out of that is that it's not a real increase for short term buyer demand, but there definitely is the possibility for foundations for medium and long term buyer demand. And I think that is a bit of an indicator of how this market is developing as a whole at the moment. So everybody knows that you need removals in order to get to net zero. So the question is, when you start engaging with that market, and there's a lot of reasons to engage with that early. For example, the fact that it is anticipated there will be a shortage of supply in the future. And that means that actually, it does make sense to engage with it early. But you're right to question the current signals for short term buyer demand. So if you look at the market as a whole, on one hand, you've got the buyer demand side of things. On the other hand, you also need to talk about financial instruments. And I think those are the two things that this market needs. It needs clarity about the timelines for when removals will be accepted, whether that's in a voluntary environment or whether that's in a compliance environment. And on the other hand, it needs financial parties stepping into this space and starting to structure the right products. And you see that happening in various places right now. You see forward contracts being developed, you see the role of buyer coalitions is becoming very important who do not just provide offtake opportunities for forwards and futures, but also provide short term liquidity. And if you add all that up, you see a trend where the medium and long term buyer demand is becoming clearer and clearer. Thank you. And one of the other things about carbon markets is that it is so diverse, and there's so many different projects and technologies, especially in carbon removals, where direct air capture is very different from, say, enhanced rock weathering. So how does the registry keep up with these different project types? And are there particularly unique challenges that you see more in removals than, say, you would see in avoidance since you said you've been in the industry for a long time? Yeah, I think, I mean, you referred to the beginning of this conversation to a lot of the controversy that happens in a voluntary carbon markets. And if you look at what causes controversy, it's always the same. It is basically a question around additionality of projects, around baselines of projects, around reversibility. If you talk about a nature-based product, a project, it's like what happens if those trees burn down, for example. And then you talk about, let's call it project-specific issues that can also happen in non-carbon credit projects, for example, corruption. And if you look at engineered removals, there is a number of those elements that are different from other carbon credit project types, specifically around additionality, for example. You're not going to do direct air capture for any other reason other than to take CO2 out of the air. And I think that's probably the clearest example of that. Of course, you still have some of the other issues with projects that you also have in every other industrial sector, issues like corruption you need to be on top of. So those issues are less within the context of engineered removals, if you talk about issues like around additionality and baseline. Where there is more complexity is that a lot of the technologies that we are working with, they are not as mature as maybe some technologies in other sectors and other carbon credit projects. But as an organization, we also need to stay on top of the science. And I think that is what's in the engineered removal space is that there is a lot more focus on the core science behind these technologies than you see in a whole lot of the other areas of carbon credits. It also means that if you look at how parties work together within this space, it is not just a matter of working together around the carbon project development cycle, but actually it is also about working together on how you deal with the developments within the science around specific technologies. Thanks. Now, one of the other big developments we're seeing is that the compliance carbon market is starting to consider using credits from carbon removals. We're seeing that with the UK ETS, and we also see the EU considering this. So how do you see that happening? And how would that change this market? And especially for how is Bureau Earth looking at this particular development? Yes, I think there's a couple of things happening in the compliance space. And I think one of the key things that is happening from a, let's call it geopolitical point of view, is that the EU and the UK and also, for example, Canada can play a much bigger role in the engineered removal space than we thought maybe 12 or 24 months ago, where we saw a lot of the both of the supply and the buying signals coming from the US. And I think what is effectively happening within the EU and the UK is that they actually see an opportunity again to be leaders in this space. And personally, I expect that, for example, the link with the EU ETS, engineered removals with the EU ETS may very well happen much faster than we would have anticipated 12 or 24 months ago. And that will do a couple of things. It will, one, immediately create buyer demand. Two, it actually turns it into a liquid, relatively liquid asset class with all the benefits and consequences that come from it. And three is all of a sudden you've got an off-tech market that consists of thousands of companies. And as soon as that happens, then liquidity in the market will increase drastically. The demand for credit will increase drastically. How big the impact of that is going to be is going to be dependent on the price developments within the context of the EU ETS and the UK ETS. What we typically see is the price level of engineered removals sits around the $100 and above mark per tonne, whereas the EU ETS is currently trading around the 80 euro mark. So we do need to see a bit of a development in price on both sides, both on the cost side of the engineered removal side of things, as well as on the price in the EU ETS. But obviously when that happens, this whole market gets changed quite dramatically. Thank you. And now moving maybe to a little bit more of a sort of philosophical question, but carbon markets generally have been quite polarized and there are a lot of people within the policymakers, but also environmental activists have not really fully embraced carbon. So how would you try and convince or encourage some sort of detractors, so to speak, especially of carbon and removals to embrace this market? So on one hand, it is almost like a philosophical question. It's like, do you believe fundamentally in financial markets to help solve environmental problems? And a lot of the discussions that are happening, for example, on LinkedIn, or that you have with people in person about this, fundamentally come down to that question. Like, do you believe in financial markets or not? And if someone's view is that they don't believe in that fundamentally, it's going to be a very difficult question. If you look at decarbonizing supply chains, for example, a typical fashion company or a food and bath company has got somewhere between five and 15,000 suppliers, of which a large volume of those suppliers are actually sitting in countries where financing projects is actually much more complex than it is in, for example, the European Union. And if you actually then start looking at the role that carbon credits can play, they become part of the project finance stack in a way that is actually extremely advantageous to the project. So very fundamentally, using an asset class like a carbon credit can actually lead to a much lower cost of capital for both the company in the supply chain, as well as for the company that is trying to decarbonize its supply chain to actually achieve a ton of CO2 emission reductions. And if you can actually reduce the risk of doing this project, if you can reduce the cost of capital by very fundamentally bringing in an asset class that is priced in a hard currency, that cannot be a bad thing, whether you believe in carbon markets as a mechanism or not, because what effectively happens is you actually deploy capital that otherwise would not be deployed. So the flip side of that, and in the argument, it always goes back to the issue we were talking about earlier. It's like, is that money actually being used to reduce a ton of CO2? And how do you know it is a ton of CO2? And that is where the whole focus on quality and transparency comes back. So I 100% agree with opponents of these markets that it only works if you focus on quality, and if you focus on transparency, and if you focus on proper monitoring and verification protocols. Great. Thank you very much. Great to have you here on the podcast. My co-hosts, Taylor Kirkendall, Dan Testa, Camilla Nashat, Christopher Coates, and Karen Willenbrecht.

I'm your co-host, Taylor Kirkendall, and today we have the privilege of speaking with Rich Powell. He's the CEO of both the Clean Energy Buyers Association and the Clean Energy Buyers Institute. SEBA boasts a membership of 400 companies that collectively represent over $15 trillion in market cap. As of the second quarter of 2024, the members have secured contracts for 84 gigawatts of new clean energy, so major customers of clean energy. See, Rich is at the forefront of this mission to foster a global community of energy consumers that are committed to advancing a sustainable energy future, and while trying to tackle some of the challenging market and policy obstacles that come along with trying to achieve a carbon-free energy system. As we navigate the current political climate, we wanted Rich to share some of the perspectives on challenges that clean energy buyers are facing over the next four years, particularly in light of this big recent shift in federal government that we've seen in the US. He's also going to highlight some potential opportunities that could emerge during this period. We're also going to discuss how the demand for clean energy is evolving under the current administration compared to previous years, and whether SEBA members are starting to adjust their strategies for clean energy procurement. Rich is also going to elaborate on maybe the relationship between economic growth and this increasing demand for carbon emissions-free electricity, and explore how those two factors are connected. We're also going to dive into the critical issue of permitting reform, and its significance on facilitating some of these clean energy projects. Finally, we're also going to be talking about the federal technology neutral energy tax credits, discussing some of their relevance to clean energy procurement, and also some of the potential ramifications of this repeal that we're looking at in the US Congress right now, and what that might mean for energy prices and job creation. Without further ado, let's hear it from our talk with Rich. Now, a lot of things are moving on the federal government level. We just want to remind you that this interview took place in the last week of May. Hello. Thank you, Rich. Thank you very much for coming on Energy Evolution. So happy to be here. Thanks so much for having me. Absolutely. Rich, to start off, for our listeners that are not familiar with the Clean Energy Buyers Association, can you just tell us a little bit about your group, what you do, who your members are? Sure. So Clean Energy Buyers Association, we call it SEBA, is the largest group of corporate buyers of electricity in the world. And everyone's united with a common quest to find low-cost, reliable, carbon-emissions-free electricity systems. We've got 400 members, 200 of those are buyers. They range hugely across all areas of the economy. So we've got folks from big technology, we have manufacturers of everything from automobiles to consumer devices. We have metals and minerals and retailers and food and ag. If you buy a lot of American electricity, you're probably a member of SEBA. Excellent. And we've seen a really big shift in the federal government in the last couple of months, especially at the top, seems to be a lot less interest in things like the Inflation Reduction Act that supported some of these technologies. I'm wondering, given this kind of shift that we've seen in government, what are some of the challenges you foresee for some of your clean energy buyer members? And on the other hand, what are maybe some opportunities that might exist now that didn't exist a couple months ago? Yeah, well, you know, to take a big step back, the biggest thing that's happened in energy in the last year or so has nothing to do with the election or anything else. It's returning America, at the very least, to gross mode in electricity. So we had pretty flat electricity demand in the last two decades. There were a lot of changes in the margins. We built a lot of renewables in the U.S., we built a lot of gas in the U.S., we retired a lot of legacy assets that changed the electricity mix. But the overall size of the grid stayed about the same through that period. It was actually pretty extraordinary, totally unprecedented historically in the U.S. to have flat low growth. And that's now changed. So 2024 was the first year where we saw significant low growth again since the 1990s. And that appears now set to continue at least through 2030 and maybe beyond. Maybe this is just, again, the new normal that'll take us all the way through 2050. We are out of practice in rapidly expanding the size of our grid. And I mean that on all fronts. We're out of practice on building huge amounts of new generation, we're out of practice on upgrading the grid we have, and we're out of practice on expanding the grid, like meaning building new large wires and expanding the grid around the country. And so we need to get back into gross mode on all those fronts. And so the new political situation, there are absolutely opportunities in all that. There are also some challenges we're working through right now. I mean, the opportunities in this are huge. We have an administration coming in and we have increasing bipartisan support in Congress to do the kinds of fundamental reforms to our permitting processes and our transmission processes that I think people have talked about for a long time, but not taken a lot of action on. We now have an administration, and I think a Congress that is excited about taking deep action on those things. So that is a really exciting opportunity, and we're engaging deeply with policymakers on that. Some of the challenges have been around things like the tax incentives. And so we've been very engaged with folks in Congress around making sure that there's a very clear policy ahead on those tax incentives in order to keep electricity systems low cost and reliable as we get back here into gross mode. And we've done a lot of analysis, which I'm happy to talk about, which shows that if you hastily take those incentives away, you could see significant increases in electricity prices, you could see significant problems with reliability, and you could see wider economic impacts as those electricity prices then translate into a hit for the broader economy, not just for our great big businesses, but for all of our customers across the US as well. Can you maybe elaborate on a little bit? What does your research say the impacts are going to be, just to maybe put a little bit of color and scale around that? Sure. So we've worked with an economic modeling firm called Nira Consulting, and we've taken a look at what would happen if you took the tax credits away. To get technical for a minute, I'm going to say these are very specific tax credits. So they're often called the technology neutral tax credits, and they're production tax credits and investment tax credits for all new carbon emissions-free technologies. So this would be for wind, and solar, and nuclear, geothermal, hydro, and thermal resources like gas and biomass, if you put carbon capture on those things. So those things are all now on a level playing field in the tax code. They all receive production tax credits and investment tax credits when you build new stuff. And so we looked at what would happen if those were rapidly taken away. And what our research at a national level found was a pretty immediate and pretty significant price impact. So nationwide, electricity bills go up about 8%. It's a little lower, thankfully, for residential payers. For our customers, we think of them something like 7%. And then for our businesses, and this is big corporations, and this is medium-sized, and even small businesses, the folks who pay commercial and industrial rates, their rates would go up something more like 10%, and this would happen immediately. And then we've double-clicked on that, and we've looked at a lot of individual states. And unfortunately, we see that there are really acute price increases in a number of states. And so places like the Carolinas and Illinois and a few other places, they see much more significant double-digit increases. Some states even looking at in the 20%, Maine, for a couple of reasons, is sort of more in the 20%. I'm happy to go through that in greater depth, but I think it's just important to know when you rapidly increase electricity prices, that also has other follow-on effects. Like electricity is something that everybody buys. It's just a fundamental input for our economy. So if you make a retailer's electricity prices go up, that means grocery prices are going to go up there. Also, if you rely less on these new resources that are going to come out of the grid because they become more expensive because the incentives go away, you're going to have to rely more on continuing to run the old resources that are by definition more expensive because they're about to be replaced. And so when you do that, for example, when you increase the run rates of a lot of older natural gas-fired power plants, for example, not only is that pretty expensive to do, but that also increases the costs of natural gas across the whole economy. So home heating becomes more expensive, and natural gas as an input to manufacturing processes becomes more expensive too. So suddenly you have this kind of compounding economic effect across the whole energy-dependent part of the economy, which is basically the whole economy. And suddenly you see really significant hits to GDP in a number of states. You see really significant employment effects, often in the thousands, even tens of thousands of jobs in key states across the country, and deeper impacts to just residential pocketbooks. If you look at just the electricity prices themselves, you're probably talking between like $100 and $200 a year across the country in electricity price increases. But then when you layer onto that the increased costs of all goods, and you layer onto that the increased costs in natural gas for home heating for so much of our country that heats their homes that way, you start to talk about pretty significant price impacts on a lot of folks around the country. And I think a good point to remember here too is a lot of people talked about these tax credits being relatively safe because of the spread across red and blue states, and you just detailed a whole lot of potential impacts of the repeal. But I'm just wondering, what's that conversation sounding like in D.C. right now? Are you hearing people receptive to this message of these things are important, we need to keep them in place, or is it still a fight on the Hill? Well, for those that are not D.C. policy nerds, that were not following the votes that happened last week here in D.C., we had a setback on this issue. So the bill that came out of the U.S. House of Representatives, so this isn't done, this is the beginning of the negotiation here, but the bill that was finalized, I get my dates messed up, either very late Wednesday night or very early Thursday morning. I think the final vote was really early Thursday morning and then everybody collapsed and went to sleep for the rest of the day. The members kind of did something heroic in getting this thing across the finish line. This is the massive bill that's going through the reconciliation process right now. It's fundamentally a tax bill. This is the bill that would extend the TCJA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It was kind of the great big tax bill that President Trump in his first term, working with Speaker Paul Ryan, got across the finish line back in 2018 and made really significant adjustments to the whole tax regime for the country. Net was a very good thing for the country, greatly increased economic growth. Everyone's 401k certainly benefited from this because we made a big, long overdue adjustment to corporate income tax rates. It was a very important bill that was set to expire at the end of this year, so all of those tax rates were going to snap back to their previous levels. Right now, Congress has the unenviable job of figuring out how to extend that whole tax regime, which is a big, complex, very expensive thing to do. They were looking at that extension and then how to pay for that extension. Unfortunately, these technology neutral tax incentives and some related ones for clean manufacturing have gotten caught up in that conversation. Portions of those are being used to pay for that broader tax extension. What we saw last week was the tech neutral credits and the clean investment credits significantly pared back, meaning that they ended a lot earlier than they would have otherwise. The terms of the credits significantly changed. So rather than being able to collect the credit if you've just started a project, the project has to be completed by 2028, so the date when they are turned off. That's a really big hurdle in energy. Energy projects take a long time to build and put into service, so it basically means that a project isn't under construction today or maybe several years into construction today, they wouldn't be able to take this credit by 2028. They also added in the legislation some new language, I think well-intentioned language, that is trying to get it making sure that US taxpayer dollars don't enrich state-owned companies from countries that we see as foreign adversaries. So this is called foreign entity of concern language. That's the term of our FIOC. They added some really significant new restrictions to these tax credits to go through this FIOC process, again, with good intentions, but the new process they've created is so onerous that I think it could be described as a poison pill for all of the credits. So it's not just that they end now in 2028 as opposed to ending in 2033, it's that the ones that can still go through have to go through a process that might be impossible for really almost any project to go through. So that's what happened last week. And we did see, though, that there was significant Republican support in the House for continuing these credits in some way, shape, or form, and dozens of members were very active on that, very public about that. And folks in the Senate on the Republican side, a number of folks have seen what came out of the House and said, well, we'll need to make really significant adjustments to that in the Senate if we're going to preserve American competitiveness and electricity affordability and jobs in our states. And so that process has now gone over to the Senate where they'll have to take the House's bill, make fair modifications, pass that, and then to finalize the whole process, it's got to go back. Both chambers have got to vote on the same bill. So eventually they'd have to go back to the House and they'd have to pass it as well before this whole thing is done. Trevor Burrus You mentioned earlier that we're not really used to this growth mode that we're going back into in terms of how much electricity demand we need. One of the big things that people will talk about a lot in the energy space and how hard it is to build things, as you just mentioned, though, permitting reform needs to be done to make that happen. I wonder, can you tell me a little bit about what you see is the appetite for maybe getting in there and making it easier to permit and build projects in the U.S. and what the appetite is for maybe tackling that this year in D.C.? Mark Miller Sure. So we need to do a couple of things on the permitting side. We need to make it more straightforward. If you've got a new generating project, whether that's a new small modular nuclear plant or a new solar farm or a battery facility, we need to make it more straightforward to site and permit that thing. We need to limit the length of the lawsuits around those things because our current permitting process invites the public to come in and participate in the process and then gives the public a chance to sue over the results of that process. And that can often stretch on for years, sometimes even decades or more. So we've got to limit that. And then we also have to improve the process and give more certainty to expanding our grid. So both upgrading the grid we have and then building new long-haul transmission lines. So those are the major pieces that we need to do. The good news is that almost all of those pieces were included in a big legislative package that folks in D.C. called the Manchin-Barrasso Bill because it was sponsored by former chair Joe Manchin, now retired from West Virginia, and then his equivalent in the Senate, Senator John Barrasso, who drove that forward, both in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That legislation moved really significantly last year. And it was actually an attempt to get it fully passed in the quote-unquote lame duck. So the period after the election and before the end of the year, last year in D.C., we didn't quite get it across the finish line. But along the way, a lot of people voted for that bill and very bipartisan. So this was traditionally an issue where there were really deep partisan divides. You saw a lot of Democrats that were really concerned about changing the permitting regime because often sort of environmental activism has been more about stopping stuff than promoting stuff. And so they're concerned about changes to that. And then you traditionally had a lot of conservatives who were skeptical about building a lot of transmission across the country because they were concerned about states' rights and who paid for that. And this was really sort of a coming together of all the camps just recognizing we've got to get back into bill mode and we've got this huge new electricity demand coming. And so we're really optimistic that in this Congress, especially once we're through this other bill, this reconciliation bill, we can get back to a robust bipartisan conversation about getting this done. I think the crucial thing for folks to remember is that this is real energy policy, and energy policy can't move through the U.S. Congress through this reconciliation procedure. It's got to be something that just moves in normal, regular order, particularly through the Senate. And that means 60 votes are required in the Senate, and that means it's got to be bipartisan. So regardless of what it is, it's going to have to be a big compromise where all sides give a little to get a lot. And we do think that there's a solution there that at the very least can make a lot of positive motion forward in this Congress, but maybe even get completed in this Congress. And I think you'd have an administration that would want to sign a big piece of legislation like that, because it knows how urgent it is that we fix this permitting regime and get us building fast. And when we talk about these zero-carbon energy resources, I know we mentioned solar, wind, nuclear. Those jump to mind really quickly. But we also have an administration that for the first time in a while is talking about things like coal plants again. I'm wondering, does carbon capture and some of those technologies fit into this as far as SEBA's concerned, or do you guys have a position on whether that's a viable technology for meeting some of these needs? So our position is that we are for carbon emissions-free technologies, and then our various members decide which one of those work for themselves and their approaches and their philosophies. And so we've got folks that have a variety of perspectives on this. Some have come out very publicly and said that things like natural gas with carbon capture would work within their framework in certain circumstances. And so just notably, both Meta, Google, for example, have come out and said that it would work to advance their approach, and they've got different projects going in different places on that. And I think the key questions in folks' minds are, what about the methane that goes into the machine? Is that responsible methane? So we're making sure that there aren't a lot of leaks along the way. How much of the CO2 are you capturing when you burn the gas and turn it into electricity? Are you doing something with the CO2 you didn't capture? So like, are you pulling that back out of the air, for example, with carbon dioxide removal or something else? And then what's being done with the CO2 once you capture it? Is it being permanently stored? And so I think those are the big questions that people are grappling with as they think about this. In terms of economic viability, that does remain to be seen. And so I'm very hopeful. I'm sort of a longtime advocate for more research and innovation in those technologies. The trouble is that right now, we don't have an operating gas plant up and running anywhere in the US with carbon capture. We've got lots of gas plants running, so we know that technology works really well. And we've got lots of carbon capture running, so we know that works really well. We do tens of millions of tons a year over time, about 10 million tons a year in the US of capture. We know that works well. It can be permanently sequestered. It's safe and effective. We haven't put those two things together in the US in a while. We had one back in the 1990s, believe it or not, a small gas plant with carbon capture running in the Northeast. It operated just fine. We know it could be done, but people get a lot more confident when there's something out there for them to go and to look at, and then ideally when there's a couple of different people with a product offering around it. So there are a number of companies that have live offerings now, and a number of our buyers of electricity are evaluating those offerings. And I think it remains to be seen. Last year was a breakthrough year for nuclear amongst our members. So we had multiple different members sign some version of power purchase agreements or bring old plants back online or make investments in advanced nuclear companies. So companies got to conviction on advanced nuclear last year. We'll see if folks come out publicly and get to conviction on gas with CCS in particular this year. And you mentioned growth again. For the longest time, any kind of economic growth or demand growth necessarily meant that we were going to have increased emissions, right? And that story is definitely changing. But I'm wondering, are we technologically, are we there at the point where we can realistically say, hey, we can go out here and grow the economy, but also grow electricity demand without increasing emissions, or are we a little ways off from that still? So when you think about the kind of growth we have today, we're experiencing right now, we actually need grids to grow with more capacity through a whole year. So that means that new capacity needs to be added to grids that runs with high reliability, 24-7, 365. And so we're getting very close to the point where all of that growth could be met with new low-carbon electricity. But there are portions of a year when we still struggle. So we've got terrific tools in solar and in wind and in battery storage. And so all of those things, there are huge amounts of those that are commercially viable today. They're sitting and waiting in interconnect queues around the country. This gets into a nerdy topic, but there's just an enormous amount of this that is already applied to get itself connected to the big regional transmission organizations that run our grids around the country. Our whole grid today is about 1,100 gigawatt hours, or 1.1 terawatts. Waiting in those lines around the country, there's 1.5 terawatts, or 1,500 gigawatts new projects that want to get connected. So we've got a lot with those. But when you put together those solar projects and those wind projects and those battery projects, they typically don't fully cover all 24-7, 365 hours in the year. And so we're still needing what folks often call clean, firm technologies that can actually run all of those times. So they could be dispatched in the particular times when the sun isn't shining, the wind isn't blowing, and it's too many hours away from when they last did, so our existing batteries can work. And so those clean, firm technologies, we sort of know what the candidates are. We know it's small modular reactors or advanced nuclear. We know it's enhanced geothermal technologies. We know it's really advanced batteries. People call this long-duration energy storage. So things that could store electricity not just for a couple of hours, but often for weeks. And we know it's some form of carbon capture, right? So gas plants with carbon capture, for example, best candidate. Oh, and maybe commercial fusion, which, fascinatingly, is closer on the horizon than a lot of people probably realize. So those are the candidate technologies out there. None of them today are running at big commercial scale. So none of them today are quite where solar and wind and short-duration battery storage are. And we need to get at least one of those, and ideally a couple of those, up to full commercial readiness very soon if we're actually going to meet all of that low growth clean. But the good news is that we can meet the vast majority of that low growth in a very clean way. So regardless how you look at it, the carbon intensity of our economy will continue to go down through this period of growth. But obviously, the carbon intensity going down is only good for so long. We actually do need to completely reduce CO2 in our economy. And so we need some of those clean, firm technologies to fully beat that gap. Excellent.

I'm your host Ikhlavya Gupte, and in this episode we will try to shed some light on an event that shocked the European electricity industry and sparked debates about the reliability of our decarbonized power systems. The incident in question is of course the recent power outage on the Iberian Peninsula, which plunged much of Spain and Portugal into darkness for several hours in late April. To discuss this in more intricate detail, I'm joined by correspondent Camilla Naschert, who has been closely following not only the event, but also the fallout from the Iberian blackout. Welcome Camilla. Hi Ikhlavya. So Camilla, I guess many of our listeners will have closely followed this story, but can you please give us a quick recap of what happened? Yeah, so the outage happened on April 28th, around 12.30pm Spanish time, when data from transmission system operator Red Electrica showed a plunge in power consumption, from around 25 gigawatts to 10 gigawatts, while there were also reports of a complete loss of load. The blackout disrupted key infrastructure across both Spain and Portugal, think public transportation, traffic signals, hospitals, manufacturing plants, digital payment systems, etc. Banking systems were also interrupted, metros and trains were stopped, and many hospitals had to activate on-site generators and reduce services while power was being restored. Now by April 29th at 7am, the power system had recovered 99.9% of its demand. The restart was also helped by imports from France and Morocco. And since then, we've had an investigation by Spanish authorities into the cause of the outage is ongoing, and power plant operators and the TSO are denying responsibility and blaming each other. And the context of that is that whoever is found liable may have to pay hefty fines. Now to get into the details of the event and its consequences, let's hear from Kerry Tackersmith, Senior Analyst for European Power, and from Alexandre Massé, Power and Renewables Analyst, both from Commodity Insights. Kerry, Alexandre, thank you so much for joining us on Energy Evolution. So today we'll be diving into this Spanish-Iberian power blackout that we saw last month. We're now a month on from the event and still asking a lot of questions around the cause and the implications. But do you want to start by describing the event of this outage, also maybe in historical context, how significant was this of an event? Yeah, hi there, and thank you for having us on the podcast. So what we saw on April 28th was a cascade of events in the Spanish grid, which over the course of just a few minutes saw a whole system blackout in Spain, Portugal, as well as parts of southern France. And as a result, there was widespread disruption. Everything from communication to payment systems to transport industry, everything went down. So in Western Europe, blackouts of this magnitude are rare. The blackout in Spain is likely the largest of this century so far, but they do happen. The last major blackout in the region was in the UK in August 2019, with about a million people affected. But it was fairly short in duration, so lasting just a few minutes to about an hour. Further back in 2006, there were blackouts in Western and Central Europe. Now these again were very short duration, but they were very widespread geographically. You have to go back to Italy and Switzerland in 2003 to get an outage of a similar size where a tree touched a power line leading to a series of grid failures and almost the whole country lost power for anywhere between an hour to 12 hours. But smaller scale blackouts are more common in Eastern Europe, for example. I think just this week, North Macedonia experienced a countrywide blackout, which lasted approximately around one hour. And if we're just going back to what happened last year, in June 2024, we have been seeing that the Balkans region has experienced widespread blackouts. And this is a very interesting topic. But going back about the implications of the blackout, I think that we have been seeing multiple impacts in Spain regarding its energy markets. Maybe something we can then show afterwards. Yeah, no, let's get into that. How has the market reacted to this event? So on the day of the blackout, intraday auctions in Spain, which are held continuously and on an hourly basis, were halted because the grid was obviously managed by the TSO for 24 hours basically. And then basically the auction resumed the day after. But we can kind of summarize the impact on Spanish power markets with the two following impacts. The first is basically, I think since 12th of May, we have been seeing the Portuguese TSO REN just limiting the available interconnection capacity between the countries, between two countries. This means that basically Portugal can import less power from Spain. And something interesting is that limitation has occurred from 9am on the morning to 7pm on the evening. And usually during this timeframe, we are seeing that Portugal is importing power from Spain as solar generation is rising in the country and kind of pressurizing prices. And this time, because capacity was lower, we have seen that surplus being kept in Spain. And as a result, the two markets kind of coupled. Something interesting is that the Spanish market has seen its lowest ever power prices since then. I think it was minus 15 euros per megawatt hour, which is a very interesting topic as only two years ago, those negative prices didn't exist. If we are going to the maybe second impact, I think that the Spanish system has been running on the safe mode basis since the end of the blackout, which is something confirmed by the energy ministry in Spain. And this has led to very high redispatch levels in Spain. But this means that basically, even still, we are seeing no thermal capacity being selected on the day ahead market. The TSO has lifted that amount of thermal generation since the end of the blackout. And this has no impact on day ahead prices nor on futures, but this has profound impacts in terms of electricity bills and gas demand in the country. Maybe if we can take a step back and look at the Spanish electricity grid and the power mix in Spain, obviously, we've seen huge shifts in that across all of Europe, not just in Iberia. But what can we say about how the power mix and the grid in Spain have evolved in recent years, obviously, as the energy transition has gone on? So what do we know about that? I think you're right. Basically, the transformation of Spain's generation mix really mirrors what is the plan for several European countries in terms of decarbonization of their power system. Only a decade ago, Spanish generation mix was dominated by coal, gas, nuclear, and only very little by renewables. And in 2024, wind and solar generation only accounted for nearly 45% of its power demands. And when we include hydro, that figure rise to nearly 60%, which is very impressive. And obviously, as you pointed out, this shift has been driven by a fast increase in solar capacity. Basically, in 2024, capacity was above 40 gigawatts, which is nine times above its 2015 level. So yes, very impressive and fast transformation. I think that a key development has been the rise of decentralized energy assets. Just to be clear now, nearly a quarter of the Spanish solar fleet is installed on rooftops, which is operating kind of outside TSO control. Meanwhile, when the country was retiring coal plants, for instance, those plants were large capacity plants, which were grid connected. So you have also that shift from large centralized plants to very small, tiny decentralized fuel plants. And the final point about the transformation of the Spanish energy system is the fact that Spain aims to phase out its seven gigawatt nuclear fleet by 2035. And it's supposed to be starting in 2027 with the first plan decommissioning. And basically, this is the last nuclear phase out policy standing among the big Western European countries. And despite the recent intensification of debate around that policy, there are currently no plans to reverse that phase out basically. And when we now start to think about the causes of this audit, we're seeing obviously an ongoing investigation by authorities in Spain. And then this, I guess you could say tug of war between the grid operators and the power plant operators. Now, as we speak, clearly, this is a fluid situation. What do we know? What can we say for sure, if anything about the causes? Yeah. So at the time of recording on 23rd of May, as you said, the exact cause of the outage isn't known. Lots of investigations underway. In the immediate aftermath, there's been a huge amount of finger pointing, blaming everything from the amount of renewables in the grid, creating instability and low inertia, blaming the low levels of nuclear on the system, blaming lack of grid investment, some suggestions of IT and cyber attacks. And as you say, just yesterday, there were reports from the chair of the Spanish TSO, Ari's parent company, blaming large power plants for not doing the job of voltage control, which needless to say, is being pushed back on by the major generators. So what we do know is that we have a timeline. We know that around 30 minutes prior to the blackout, there were reports of unusual frequency oscillations in the wider European grid. And so the European TSO Association has said that it dealt with those oscillations, that the grid was normal at the time of the blackout. So it's currently unclear if and how these oscillations were linked. We know that half an hour later, there was a loss of generation at a substation in the Spanish province of Granada, followed by two successive substation failures in other regions. So these amount to a little bit over two gigawatts loss in generation and resulted in a drop of grid frequency. In the last week, there has been a lot of talk from the energy ministry in terms of over-voltage on the grid. But we currently do not know what triggered that initial drop in generation. Did it cause the over-voltage or was it reacting to the over-voltage? That generation loss then triggered load shedding. That's an emergency measure designed to stabilize the grid, but that was insufficient. We're not sure why it didn't work. Finally, as the frequency continued to fall in Spain, the Spanish and French grids disconnected, which led to another massive disconnection of generation and led ultimately to the blackout. So from this initial generation loss, there is a cascade of events triggering the full blackout, all of which happened in just a few minutes. And there's likely to be a whole web of complex interlinked factors, which if they didn't set the ball rolling on the blackout, at the very least, they contributed to the blackout by making the system more vulnerable. I think that just was what Kerry was saying. We know that renewables on the grid was very high at the moment of the blackout, but they were not exceptionally high. Wind and solar were accounting for nearly 70% of power demand at the moment of the blackout, which is high. But as I said, we have been seeing hours with higher penetration of renewable on the grid. Just in 2024, we have been seeing around a thousand hours above that level. And something interesting is that super recently, right before the blackout in April 16th, Spanish grid at least met all of its demand with renewables, so wind, solar and hydro, which is basically the all time high record. But I think the figure pointing needs to be taken very cautiously. There have been a lot of commentary suggesting that there is a lack of inertia. That topic has kind of reverted back to voltage control recently, but there is a lot of conflicting arguments, as said Kerry, and there is not a clear single reason behind the explanation of the blackout. As said Kerry, it's massively complex. Just maybe opposing what we are seeing at the moment in Spain versus what happened last year. So as I said previously, last year we saw a blackout, widespread blackout in the Balkans in June, and we only got the report of the explanation of the causes back in February 2025. So this I think underlines well the complexity of those events, as said Kerry, it's a cascade of very localized and complex power system defaults. In the case of the Balkans, the cause was something very different to what has been discussed previously. For instance, the initial short circuit has been triggered by a vegetation growth which has been too close from the power lines. So this is interesting to see how those events are being analyzed basically. Yeah, in this case we simply don't know yet, but we can say that a renewable-led future needs a modernized grid and a way of managing the grid in a modern, clean, fast response way. And other markets have been perhaps a little bit more forward-thinking in this area. So just yesterday, California's system operator approved a 4.8 billion transmission plan to support the grid against rising demand, to integrate renewables and batteries, to provide upgrades for grid-enhancing technologies to enhance transmission capacity. Similarly in the UK, which is like Spain, a high renewable island, the grid operator NISA has been working to decarbonize its grid balancing and enhance stability using its Stability Pathfinder projects. So just in March, GB's first of five grid-forming batteries was connected to the grid in Scotland under this initiative. So those are batteries that they're an advanced battery storage system that can independently stabilize and support the grid. GB in general has been able to integrate a lot more batteries onto its grid relative to Spain, and a lot of those are active in frequency services and in system balancing. So we estimate over 8 gigawatts of batteries on the GB grid compared to just over 2 gigawatts in Spain, which by 2030 is expected to rise to 30 gigawatts in GB compared to just 11 gigawatts in Spain. And batteries are crucial to the markets for helping them integrate the rollout of renewable power. And I think the final point about this is that just looking at Spain's position in Europe, you can see that Spain is very isolated, both from a geographical point of view, and this has direct consequences on how the market is operating. At the moment, Spain has only one connection linkage, I'd say, with continental Europe, through France basically. And despite having this interconnection, this interconnection cannot mitigate that isolation as it represents basically less than 10% of its peak demand. We are seeing that in contrast to European countries such as Germany, Poland, which can rely on several other neighbours in case there is an imbalance in their markets, Spain has very limited support from its neighbours. In the case of the blackout, the interconnection just tripped. At the moment, the frequency dropped below safety measures. What does it mean? It means that if we were keeping that interconnection online, the frequency drops will have basically safety issues on electrical devices in France and Spain and could potentially transfer that blackout in France more widely. And ultimately, the support from neighbouring countries during the blackout was very limited. Obviously, Morocco and France helped during the reconstruction of the grid, but this remained very limited. And looking at how fast the Spanish grid can be reconstructed, it means that further support would have been basically a great help. Just looking at what is happening also, there is a new line in construction at the moment between France and Spain, but it will be only commissioned by 2028. And despite seeing the interconnection capacity doubling by then, we're seeing that this isolation in Europe will not be fully compensated. And it's an area where we could see those blackout potential changes as maybe more political appetite for new interconnection projects could emerge, basically. That's really interesting. And I mean, if there's listeners out there like me who are just frantically taking notes, because there were so many interesting points just raised by you both, there will be a report by your team the same week as we're launching this podcast, so early June. So subscribers to the Commodity Insights analytic services will be able to read a little bit more with the caveats that you just laid out around ongoing uncertainty. So maybe the final point is around the kind of discussion that you just raised already about grid security. We've seen reactions across Europe, executives at every utility being asked about potential repercussions or similar events happening in other markets, even as far as the US. Why was this so impactful that it really prompted this wider debate in other markets? And do you think that is the right conclusion, the right concern to take away from this? Yeah, so gosh, why did Spain make the headlines? It's a really good question. I think it's a combination of a location and impact. Unlike most blackout events, it was a countrywide event which lasted for over 12 hours from start to finish, and led to a significant amount of disruption. Any event like this just highlights how dependent we are on our electricity networks in our modern world. And it's something that we probably take for granted, particularly in Western Europe. We expect this perfect supply of electricity. It also comes at a time when there's a lot of discussion around the electrification story, so the electrification of industry, of heating, of transport, around the build-out of data centers, which have got really high electricity demands and need this 24-7 power. So we forecast electricity demand in Western Europe to increase by 13% by 2030, relative to 2025, by 55% by 2040. And of that, we're going from around 35% of that demand being met by renewables to over 50% by 2030, nearly 70% by 2040. So that's a really big ask on the electricity grid. And it's the same ask that other grids across the world are having to deal with. So irrespective of the exact cause or causes of the Iberian event, enhancing and investing in our grid systems, modernizing them, adapting them for renewable penetration, is really something that we need to be doing more of. We need to be putting the right value on what is really a critical piece of infrastructure. That's a great final word. Thank you both, Kerry and Alexandre, so much for joining us on Energy Evolution. We, the reporters and analysts here at Commodity Insights, will obviously continue to keep tabs on this story. So look out for the latest updates as this evolves. Thank you both. In the reactions to the outage, we've also heard an emphasis on the need to shore up energy security at the same time as pursuing decarbonization. And to give more details into this perspective, we spoke to Alboric Montgrenier, who serves as the Executive Director of the European Initiative for Energy Security. They are a think tank and a campaign group which is focused on building support for energy and national security across the European continent. Welcome to Energy Evolution. So you head the European Initiative for Energy Security. And I'm interested to hear how this event, this blackout, fits into the theme of energy security that has, of course, been high on the agenda in Brussels and other EU capitals in recent years. Can we already draw any conclusions from the blackout? And would you say this is a one-off event? Or do you advocate for seeing this as a systemic energy security issue? Well, it's not the first blackout in the recent history of Europe. It won't be the last one either. In Western Europe, we had a big one in 2006, which was caused by some routine work. Before that, there was another one in Italy in 2003, which was caused by a tree. In the US, you certainly remember the 2021 Texas freeze, which was provoked by a very strong winter storm. And more recently and more consequently in Europe, there's obviously the regular blackouts all over Ukraine, which are caused by Russia's missile and drone attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. The point I'm trying to make here is that these events, they don't happen often, at least in peace times, but it can happen again. And the causes can be many. It can be weather events, human error, technical failure, often all of three combined, or it can even be deliberate attacks, whether physical or cyber on infrastructure, which Europe sees more and more of. That said, it's not a fatality for Europe. What it shows is that we need to be better prepared to deal with the increasing complexity of our energy system. And the best way to avoid and prepare for this is to invest in grids, interconnectors, storage, redundancy, especially with so much renewables in the mix, storage is very important. But we also need to invest in cyber and physical resilient solutions and components that meet certain requirements in terms of security resilience. Do you think policymakers are aware and companies are aware of this investment need that you're calling for? Or do you think there's more to do on that front? I think we already knew that we underinvest in the European grid. So this is in a way a helpful, but dangerous and costly reminder. I think we saw estimates that show that this cost the Iberian economy at least 2 billion euros, maybe somewhere between 2 and 4 billion. So it will force politicians to prioritise the grid in the next few years. And it will also push experts and technicians to find new methods to contain potential disruption. The thing is, energy security today means a lot of different things. It's security of supply, the traditional way that we all know, but it's also material supply chains, whether we're talking about minerals or components. It's also infrastructure security, I've mentioned physical and cyber attacks before. And all of these dimensions offer huge challenges at the moment. And they all get a fair amount of attention in the media. And they get attention from politicians also, whether it's Chinese mineral export restrictions, hybrid attacks by Russian and Chinese ships on undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, the industrialisation caused by high energy costs all over the European continent, etc. So the problem is less that the issue is not getting attention, but rather than that there are many different and very serious risks that the private sector and policymakers must prioritise at the moment. And it's been constant crisis mode in the world of European energy since 2022. Another issue is that such events also take place in a context of political polarisation and debates on the energy transition. And some pundits are quick to comment and politicise the debate and certain energy technologies, which doesn't help with a rational assessment of what happened in this case to the Iberian grid, and why this blackout happened in the first place. Yeah, I mean, you just kind of touched a little bit on what I was going to ask next, which is about this, I guess you could say finger pointing, or at least it's very high profile nature of the discussion around this incident, maybe even getting worse, but through the fact that this is a complex, multifaceted event that takes time to resolve and to explain. But when this kind of thing happens, do you think this is a good reminder? Or do you think it's a maybe also a distraction from other issues that maybe occur under the radar and are less dramatic? And if so, what are those things that you think are maybe being forgotten? Well, as I said before, I think there's plenty of things happening in the world of energy security at the moment, and they're getting a lot of attention. It's multi-dimensional. So I don't think it's a distraction. It does point to the fact that we need serious investment in the grid. I think that's probably one of the most important dimensions of energy security for Europe going forward, electricity security, specifically. Historically, when we speak about energy security, we used to think about getting enough gas and oil into the system. But as we electrify and digitalize our energy system, which is both our megatrends, and they're important megatrends and essential for Europe's energy security. But that means we need to take into account the risks that we have neglected in the past. And that's why we have under-invested in the European grid. We've invested a lot in renewable production. We've invested a lot in other aspects of energy security over the past decades. But we can't say that we are over-prepared on the grid front. Otherwise, a blackout of this scale would not have happened. These investments must happen now because the cost of inaction is very high, both for the European economy and for collective security. Now, your organization is lobbying for more energy security, obviously, also from a geopolitical perspective. You were started in 2022 amid the war in Ukraine, where energy, of course, has been such a core issue. Aside from the grid investments that you just mentioned, what are some of the other key measures that you're asking for on that front, especially on a policy level? Yeah, good questions. So we're actually on a number of fronts. So grid and energy infrastructure, generally speaking, is one aspect. But we're also very much focused on supply chains, the supply chains that power electrification. So I'm thinking here about critical minerals, but also critical components that go into grids, but also vehicles, well, the transport sector, generally speaking. What we see now is that, okay, Europe is moving towards electrification, which is great, can be great for Europe from an energy security perspective, given that the continent is largely oil and gas poor outside of a couple of countries. But that creates new dependencies, primarily to China, which has a very dominant position in, well, critical mineral value chains, but also batteries, solar, increasingly in wind, which is an area where Europe has historically been stronger. And so these are the dependencies that we need to be aware of. And in order to manage them, we need to be able to protect European industry from Chinese overcapacity in a number of sectors in the sectors that I mentioned before, and also to support them financially, to make sure that we can develop the supply chains, not just in Europe, which is important, but also that we develop ex-China supply chains with other partner countries. And again, all along the value chain from critical minerals to batteries and wind turbines. And that's one area where we call the European Union and European leaders more broadly, and countries, including Norway and the UK, to prioritize, to make sure that we're in a position to Frenchor these supply chains as much as possible. So we're not as exposed to one single supplier like we were to Russian gas, which was not the single supplier of gas to Europe, but the largest supplier, and is still a very large provider of gas to the European continent. So it's all things that European leaders, the European Commission, national leaders, are aware of. But it's very difficult to execute in a context of limited national budgets, higher interest rates, and the era of free money is over, at least for now. And so that means that we need to prioritize strategic materials and technologies that are critical for Europe's energy security and industrial competitiveness. And that's not an easy exercise, but that's something that can and should be done as part of the new European Union budget cycle to invest in the supply chains that will allow us to move towards more energy independence.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-05-27\n==================================================\n\n### How tariff tensions are reshaping China's energy landscape\n**Episode ID:** 5070\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985763\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Energy Evolution, a Platts Podcast brought to you by S&P Global Commodity Insights, where we delve deep into the pivotal moments shaping our energy future. I'm your host, Ikhlavya Gupte, and in this episode, we're focusing on the trade tensions between China and the United States, a topic that has dominated headlines throughout 2025. We will be specifically examining how China's economic policies, energy strategies, and trade approaches are evolving in response to these ongoing tensions with the U.S. The U.S. and China have been engaged in a protracted tariff duel for several weeks. However, the two countries reached a significant agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of goods as part of a 90-day pause in hostilities. This temporary rapprochement does provide a glimmer of hope for easing tensions. But despite these positive strides, significant uncertainties linger regarding how these two economic giants will navigate their negotiations from tariff rates to broader geopolitical relations. To help us unpack these latest developments and their implications for energy markets, we are lucky to be joined by Ivy Yen, our market specialist for energy transition. Welcome to the podcast, Ivy. I know you've been following this tariff drama very closely. Can you please help us understand what are the key impacts on China's policies, especially in regards to their energy markets? Thank you, Eklavvya. So regardless of the final outcome of the U.S.-China negotiations, I think China's overall strategy will become more inward looking in the longer run. For fossil fuels, I think the LNG market is one of China's biggest concerns. As of 2024, the U.S. is still China's fifth largest market for LNG imports. So to enhance energy security, China has planned to boost its domestic production and cut in dependency. Speaking of energy transition, China is the world's largest exporter for lots of clean tech products, such as solar modules, electric vehicles, and batteries. When I talk to China's solar and EV manufacturers, many of them told me the domestic market will become their backbone in the future because of all these external headwinds and uncertainties. However, to scale up the domestic demand, China needs even more ambitious climate targets and a profound reform in terms of their economies to stimulate the domestic consumption. In summary, the impacts are significant, and to mitigate the negative impacts, China needs a sophisticated reform across economic, energy, and climate policies. Thank you, Ivy. And now besides domestic policies and strategies, what is China doing to reshape its diplomatic strategy, especially with regards to trade partnerships as we live in an increasingly fragmented ecosystem? That's a very interesting question. I think the World Trade Organization, or WTO, will definitely be a key enabler to investigate unilateral measures or settle bilateral disputes. Based on China's latest government statement, I think the Chinese leaders clearly want to leverage the WTO as a key platform to resolve all these trade disputes. Another important thing to watch is whether China can still indirectly export to the U.S. markets, counting on third countries as transshipment hubs or intermediate manufacturing hubs. There have been clear political signals as well that China wants to tighten the bonds with these hub countries, for example, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. However, when the U.S. President Donald Trump initially launched the reciprocal tariffs, this was not only targeting China, but targeting countries worldwide. So despite a 90-day pause, none of these proposed tariffs globally have been finalized. So again, there are still huge uncertainties ahead. Thanks, Ivy. That was fascinating. And Ivy was lucky to speak to two experts to learn their assessments on these critical subjects. First, we spoke to Eric Yep from our gas analytics team. During the tariff tensions, Eric has been closely monitoring the energy market reactions and policy developments in China and beyond. Hi, Eric. Welcome to Energy Evolution podcast. Could you please share with us your first take assessment about the current U.S.-China situation? Hi, Ivy. Thank you very much for having me on the podcast and allowing me to share my views on this topic. The decision to pause the tariffs on both sides is quite positive in the near term. And I think the markets have also responded quite positively. So that's a good signal. The 90-day truce is also interesting because the reduction of the tariff seems to be more than what a lot of market participants had expected. And the other thing that's quite interesting is that the decision was taken fairly quickly without a lot of extensive negotiations on both sides. I think that this signals willingness for both U.S. and China to continue the talks and it provides a very strong foundation for future negotiations as well. The current 90-day truce is temporary and there is still a lot of uncertainty in terms of how the negotiations will proceed and what the final outcome will look like. The second thing to note is that the tariff levels are still quite substantial. The U.S. has reduced it to around 30 percent plus for imports from China and China has reduced it to around 10 percent. But these are still on top of the tariffs that were already implemented earlier this year and there is still a very high risk of economic activity continuing to be slow and energy demand also declining. At the same time, there are a lot of businesses who may still be able to find the current tariff levels viable. So for example, if a business is facing about 50 percent tariffs from China, they may be able to spread it across between absorbing it within their own margins or passing it down to the customers or asking their suppliers for a little bit of a discount. So what we could potentially see is these businesses trying to accelerate their orders and shipments from China over the next three months, maybe trying to concentrate a lot of their economic activity within the next three months. So you could potentially see a lot of manufacturing activity and then energy demand concentrated over the next three months and a bit of a distortion in economic indicators as well as oil and gas demand data. The final point here is that in the longer term, there are still quite a lot of uncertainties for companies and businesses going forward. There are companies who are looking at longer term strategies to manage the supply chain risk and potentially risks between US and China decoupling their businesses as well. So for many companies, the 90-day pause may just be an opportunity to fine tune some of these strategies and see how they can re-risk their business in the long term. Thank you so much, Eric. This is very insightful. So my follow-up question is, how will this US-China situation impact Chinese oil and gas companies in terms of their import strategies? I mean, not only referring to import from the US, but also import from other major exporting countries. The current tariff levels both on oil and gas for imports into China, especially for US-origin oil and gas, are still quite high. It's not enough to move the needle at the moment. So for example, Chinese tariffs on US crude oil still stand at around 20 percent, and on US LNG, it's still around 25 percent. And these tariffs are too high at current price levels for the trade flows to resume. In terms of how the Chinese companies are managing this, especially on the LNG side, for instance, is to continue executing swaps for US-origin LNG that comes into China. They are looking at other destinations where they can place US-origin LNG. In the longer term, there is a bit of de-risking involved over here. So we still don't know what the outcome of the negotiations over the next 90 days would be. There is a chance that US LNG could become a bargaining chip within these discussions, which means that a lot of Asian importers, including China, could actually be asked to sign more US LNG contracts or even invest in projects such as Alaska LNG, which has been in the news for a while. So there's a very strong element of US LNG becoming a bargaining chip in the future trade negotiations between the two countries. As far as long-term energy security is concerned, US LNG and US oil currently forms a fairly small percentage of the total imports for China at the moment. So that is not a huge problem. There are a lot of alternatives and replacements that China can purchase in the market at the moment. However, I think for LNG, the big question was what would happen to all the long-term LNG contracts that Chinese importers had signed with US exporters over the last five years. I think there were roughly around 22.4 million tons per annum of US LNG contracts that were signed, which were expected to start after 2025. And essentially, what we were seeing over here is China being the largest growth market for LNG and US being the largest growing exporter for LNG coming together. The big question now is what happens now if there were to be decoupling. And there's still a lot of uncertainty around the negotiations. So we don't quite know where that will go at the moment. So now I want to ask about China's overall energy strategies. Two particular interesting policies in China now. First is China want to boost their domestic gas productions so as to cut import dependencies from foreign suppliers. In this March, China actually launched a series of subsidies to boost domestic unconventional gas production, like shale gas production. So the second policy is China's coal-to-gas switch in its energy transition. Because in the energy system with increasing proportion of renewables, actually natural gas plays a better role in terms of providing the base load, providing the flexibility to cope with the renewables intermittency. So as the US-China relation evolves, and given all those external uncertainties, how do you see China's energy transition progress will evolve in the longer run? I think there are a couple of questions that you have put over there. One is around China's energy security with respect to its own domestic gas production, right? So yes, definitely domestic gas production has ramped up and continues to be at a record high. And it is one of the key factors that is providing China with energy security, at least on the gas side. So we have seen China's dependence on gas consumption come down to less than 45% from imports, including both pipeline gas and energy, right? But the domestic gas production within China is still insufficient. We are still continuing to see growth within the Chinese economy, which requires gas demand on an ongoing basis. We have not reached that level where economic growth decelerates to the point where you do not have any new energy consumption coming in. So that growth is still there. So within that, the role of both imported gas and LNG is here to stay within China's overall energy mix and our mix for power generation. So we are probably going to see some impact on China's LNG demand if the current trade war results in slowdown in economic growth. But that does not have a direct linkage to the role of gas within China's broader energy transition. A lot of China's long-term decarbonisation and energy transition goals are still intact. A lot of that decarbonisation is going to come from the ramp up of large-scale solar and wind projects, which are still in the pipeline. The growth of the power grid within the Chinese energy sector, which is still continuing to meet its targets and set new records, LNG demand does tend to be affected because it is the most expensive fuel source within the various fuel stack that China has access to at the moment. But LNG still has a very strong role to play because it is one of the key fuel sources that can help the power grid meet the intermittency from the increasing amount of renewables and as peaking power. So the role of gas and LNG within China's mix has not really been impacted in a big way so far. Thank you so much, Eric. So my final question is, are there any other macro-level risk factors that we should look at apart from that US-China standoff? That's a very relevant question, Ivy, because I think the current enthusiasm from the market around the latest decision of the trade war or the tariff war is positive, but it does not account for what are potentially a lot of longer-term risks that are faced by the market. And a lot of these are uncertainties stemming from the current Trump administration and how its foreign policy, as well as its trade policy, is expected to shape up. A lot of importers within Asia Pacific are concerned about is the decoupling of businesses and supply chains between the US and China and how much that factors into the negotiations over the next 90 days. There are some very strong voices in the current Trump administration that are pushing for the decoupling to happen and it could be that some form of tariffs remains as a permanent feature within US-China trade going forward. Thank you so much, Eric. Next, we spoke to Henry Gao, professor at Singapore Management University School of Law. Henry is also an experienced advisor working closely with the WTO as well as regulators and institutions across Asia on various projects. Hi, Professor Henry, welcome to Energy Evolution. So my first question is, what's your assessment about the current situation given that US-China seems to have a temporary truce because of the freshly launched Geneva joint statement? Sure, the way things have unfolded since Liberation Day has pretty much followed the trajectory that I expected. So back on April 1st, I predicted that most of the countries would move toward a bilateral deal with the US, while China would try to retaliate at least initially. Then a few days later, on April 5th, I tweeted that I expected China to eventually give in and start negotiations, likely within two months and maybe even sooner. I also anticipated that the global situation should stabilize within a month or so. And that's exactly what happened. So on April 9th, President Trump imposed tariffs for all countries except China, signaling a pivot to bilateral negotiations. After several rounds of retaliation, China and the US finally sat down in Geneva and reached a deal to roll back most of the retaliatory tariffs. So what comes next? I see two major developments on the horizon. First, I think the US will wrap up deals with most major countries by early July. So these deals won't just cover tariff costs. They will also tackle non-tariff barriers and include specific measures to prevent China from supplementing tariffs through transshipment and tariff evasion, as we have already seen in the US-UK trade agreement. Second, even though the US-China deal is a big step, I expect to continue back and forth over deeper issues, especially on non-tariff measures. These are structural issues that are not so easy to resolve. They go right to the heart of China's economic model. So we are likely to see prolonged and difficult negotiations at least for the next few months. Okay, thank you so much, Professor Henry. That is very helpful. So my follow-up question is, as you mentioned, there are going to be lots of bilateral negotiations between the US and other countries, between the US and China, but we always have WTO, the World Trade Organization. I know you're a legal expert for WTO policies and laws, so I want to get your insight in terms of what will be the role played by WTO going forward in this increasingly fragmented world. Sure, my answer might be a bit biased because I am also an advisor to the WTO's WTO Chair's program, and also I have worked for the WTO Secretariat, so I absolutely love the organization. I would say the WTO still matters actually a lot. In fact, the kiosk we have seen recently has made its value even clearer. It's just like air. You don't realize how essential it is until it is gone. So we do need a rule-based global trading system, and I think this is where we can see some silver lining despite all these trade wars. The crisis might be the catalyst we need to kick-start serious discussion on WTO reform, which has been stalled for years, despite a few major players like the US and EU have been pushing for this since 2017. Even the WTO itself has recognized this. The WTO's Director General, Dr. Ngozi, emphasized that we must not waste this crisis, and that a reform discussion on how to reposition the WTO should become the central priority going into the 14th Ministerial Conference of the WTO to be held next March. That said, I wouldn't expect China to lead this reform effort. I would say that the Chinese system, especially its economic system, has many unresolved issues on its own. I would say that the real responsibility lies with the other major players, especially the US and EU. Ideally, Washington could take the rules. It is negotiating bilaterally, for example, not only on tariff reduction, but also on issues such as subsidies, industrial policy, domestic regulation, trans-shipment, and so on, and bring them into the WTO framework to help modernize the global trade rules. And when that happens, I think we would have a WTO 2.0 that would really help to facilitate trade across the world. Okay, thanks, Prof. So speaking of those trans-shipment or indirect export to the US market, I think Southeast Asia plays a very essential role in this to enabling all those Chinese indirect export to the US market. For example, for Cambodia, Vietnam, they're actually the trans-shipment hub or intermediate manufacturing hub for China's solar PV products. And those ASEAN countries are also Xi Jinping's first visit amid that escalating US-China tariff war. So in your view, what will the Southeast Asian region evolve? Will their role remain in this WTO 2.0 era, as you said? Sure. China also has a growing trade with ASEAN and with Belt and Road Initiative countries in general. With ASEAN bond exports rising from 12.8% in 2018 and 16.4% in 2024, and BRI exports jumping from 38.7% to 47.8% during the same period. So you could see that even China realized that Southeast Asia is a key piece in its effort to diversify the exports to the US and they are definitely going to pay more attention to Southeast Asia. And in this exchange with Southeast Asia, China is clearly using both carrots and sticks here, offering economic deals to Southeast Asia, while also threatening countermeasures for countries that align with the US. And President Xi's recent visit to the region, along with some Morfcombe's warnings that they would take immediate and quick measures against any country that tried to follow the US in squeezing China out, shows that China is trying hard to win over its neighbors. But here is a problem for Beijing. These countries aren't exactly eager to side with China. Vietnam, for example, exports just 42% of what it imports from China, and Cambodia runs a huge trade deficit with China. Its trade deficit actually accounts for about a third of its GDP. Meanwhile, if you look at these countries who trade with the US, they all enjoy significant trade surpluses with the US. So when push comes to shove, I would say that their economic incentives align more with Washington than with Beijing. And the US is clearly aware of the potential problem of transshipment of Chinese goods through these countries. So if you look at 2018, the first trade war in the first Trump administration, after he imposed 25% tariffs on China, even though China's exports to the US has been reduced, but exports from Southeast Asia to the US has spiked. Often these are just rerouted Chinese goods. That is why we are now seeing new trade agreements like the one the US just signed with the UK, which include provisions to tackle transshipment, tariff evasion, and even ownership of production facilities. And these are all indirectly pointing towards China. So given how much more transshipment goes through Southeast Asia compared to the UK, I would expect that later when the US signs the deals with Southeast Asia countries, the US would try to push even harder for specific provisions on transshipment and tariff evasion in the upcoming deals with the region. So that would make it even harder for China to transship through the region. Thank you so much, Henry. That is a very interesting conversation. All right, listeners, that is all for this episode.

I'm your host, Eklavya Gupte, and in this episode, we get to hear from SouthPol, which is one of the largest entities in the carbon markets. This company, which is both a climate finance consultancy and also a trader of carbon credits or offsets, has undergone a bit of an overhaul due to the increased scrutiny seen on the voluntary carbon markets in the past few years. The voluntary carbon market has been shaken by a credibility crisis, with the efficacy of many projects and carbon credits coming under fire from both the media and the academia. Concerns over integrity and allegations of greenwashing have led many companies and corporates to retreat from these markets. This has led to a steep fall in liquidity and confidence in these markets, with many buyers reducing their activity, and as a result, prices of many carbon offsets across various project segments have fallen sharply. The industry is now banking on some integrity initiatives led by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Market and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, and many hope that this will bring more certainty and lead to more high-quality offsets. Now SouthPol has been in the firing line as a result of this intense scrutiny, and like the voluntary carbon market, it has had to make several changes to rebuild trust and confidence and to create a more liquid, transparent and effective carbon market. We are lucky to hear from Daniel Clear, who is the CEO of SouthPol. Welcome to Energy Evolution, Daniel. Appreciate you taking your time to speak to us. So my first question to you, obviously, it's been a difficult few years for the voluntary carbon market, but also for SouthPol. So it'd be good to just get an understanding on how has the rebuilding process been, especially since you've taken over just over a year ago? Hi, Klavia. Lovely to see you. And thank you for having me on the podcast. Well, first of all, I think it's important to remember that SouthPol is as old as the carbon market. It's a company that's been created to mobilize large-scale finance for climate action, especially in the global south. That's actually why the company is called SouthPol, really paying tribute to the fact that the majority of climate action and climate justice needs to happen in the global south. And so the company exists for 18 years. It's been a pioneer in the market from the start. It did the first Kyoto transfer in 2007, the first corporate retirement in 2008, the first Article 6 transaction in the world in 2023. And so I feel very privileged to take the company now to the next level. My own background is I worked a long time in financial markets, so I look at the carbon market as a market that needs to build the muscle and needs to get the same structures that we know from other much more mature, much more established markets. And so my main job here was in the first instance to bring the structure, the discipline, the risk management approaches that we see in the regulated markets into a market that has been through many evolutions but is still very young. So if you look at SouthPol, we spent last year quite heavily on refreshing the leadership team. We were joined by Daminger Beale, the former chief executive of Lloyds of London as our new chair of the board. I joined as a CEO and were joined by a number of other new leaders, including a new chief risk officer from HSBC to build out that structure that allows us to move the market to the next level. And then we really, I think, now entered 2025 as a firm willing and ambitious to shape the next evolution of the market. I know we'll talk more about this, but I think it's a market that will look very different, much more driven by compliance, integrity, transparency, which I think will allow this market to move to that next level that everybody expects, which is a level that is 10, 20, 30 times the size of the current market to really mobilize billions and trillions rather than, I think, be stuck somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Thank you, Daniel. And I guess one of the questions also I wanted to ask you was, what would you say are some of the lessons that companies like yourselves and other companies in the voluntary carbon market have learned from the recent few years where we have had a little bit of a crisis? I always use comparisons with financial markets, right? And the banking industry, as an example, is 400, 500 years old. And still every seven to 10 years, we get into a crisis. And I think that's an important mindset because in the banking industry, nobody uses a crisis to question the market. Nobody uses a crisis to make the market better. And I think that's really important because in our industry, we did the opposite, right? We tried to question whether this market actually has a raison d'etre. And I think we all need to agree that it is absolutely critical in a world where we are significantly off track to deliver the decarbonization that we need. We need to preserve and create negative emissions capacity. We need to mobilize trillions into climate action. And the carbon market is not the only tool in there, but it's one of the tools. And so I think the issues we had in the last few years were issues that were necessary to make the market more mature. And for me, there's a combination of three things that are holding back the market and three issues that I think we're collectively solving. One is obviously supply side integrity. That's starting with work that we do internally. We're creating a real second line of defense and independent risk function. The partnership that we have with the rating agencies, and I think the really important emergence of the rating agencies as critical players in the system. And then third, I think the emergence of a real global standard set in the form of ICBCM. I think that helped a lot in reshaping the trust element in the supply side. The second one is obviously the strength and the demand signal, where I think between the emergence of now compliance markets and progress that we're starting to make, I think with SPTI and Green Claims Directive, I think are important to give companies again the confidence to act in a market that has been significantly undermined from various angles. And the third one is I think the robustness in market infrastructure. So efforts that we see now from NASDAQ, from ICE, but also from the registries themselves, is really important to build the robustness of a market that can move to the next level. So I think what have we learned? I think we've learned that the market and the industry needs to mature if we want to reach that next level. And I think you need a little crisis, frankly, to have that wake up moment. And I do feel as an industry, we've made significant progress to now prepare the ground for what is, I think, a really interesting and very different next phase of the market. Thanks very much, Daniel. And as you mentioned, this new phase, now one of the issues we're seeing today is that we're living in quite a different world. And geopolitics and trade tensions are playing a big role on all markets, but especially carbon markets. So it'd be interesting to hear your take on how these markets are ready for what we're seeing currently in geopolitics, particularly. Yeah, obviously, that's the hot potato at the moment, right? And it is very clear that politics have moved on from a world that was very centered around the progress towards net zero to a world that needs to balance growth ambitions, competitiveness, energy security, which is a word that we didn't use 10 years ago. And that obviously is now very much in center of discussion. And so on the back of that, I can paint a very negative and a very positive picture. But the negative picture is there is just no investment there to mobilize decarbonization and carbon markets, adaptation, mitigation at the level where we need to because people have other priorities. But I think there is an opposite view, which is a much more positive view. And from my perspective, there is still a strong consensus in the world that we need to reach something that is close to the Paris Agreement. But I think there's also recognition that the shape to get there is starting to look very different, especially when you think about Europe, where there's a clear response to North America and the tensions that are coming up by investing again in the local economy, by investing in local energy infrastructure, by investing in defense, by investing in infrastructure more broadly to reunite growth and the recognition that you need a market mechanism that allows you to maintain existing nature and other negative emission sources and build them out in the sense of investing in removal capacity. And I find it very interesting that actually very quickly after the new German government was put in place, they endorsed the Article 6 market. Over the past few weeks, we saw that the European Union actually started to come out and says, actually, we still believe in net zero, but it is more and more likely that we will need to endorse a carbon market to get there. And so I think we come back to the place where really the carbon market came from. It is not the only tool and it should never be, but in a world where it is very clear that decarbonization alone will not get us there, you need that mechanism to fund large scale negative emissions capacity, preserve current and build new. And I think COP 30 will therefore be quite an important moment. I had the chance recently to speak to the incoming president for COP, and it was very interesting to hear him talk about this because for them, nature obviously is absolutely key. But what I learned also in that meeting is that they're trying to build a very strong alliance with other emerging economies. The incoming president also hosts the BRICS summit. And so actually bringing China, India, South Africa, and other nations from the global south along that journey would be really important to build that counter narrative and stress the importance of a functioning market. So you hear there are many concerns, but in my mind, the excitement for the next five years definitely outweighs the concerns. And I think what we do as an industry collectively is now more important than ever. Thank you very much, Daniel. And as you mentioned, one of the parts of the market where we have seen a little bit more demand or more activity is obviously in the compliance side, especially in the emission trading systems, but also on Article 6. So it'd be good to get your view on is the compliance market now going to become the next big carbon market? And we're seeing the various hybrid markets merge. So it'd be good to get your outlook on how you see the carbon market evolving. Yeah, brilliant. So I personally, and I think we as a company, look at three main shifts in the market. The first one is a shift that we have already talked about, the shift to more integrity, financial markets like behavior in the industry. And I think everything that we've seen on risk, on standards, on rating agencies plays into that card. So I think that's shift number one. It will not go away. It will only intensify. And the only way to rebuild the market is to lead through trust, integrity, transparency. The second big shift is that shift from what is really predominantly a voluntary market to a market that will be converging between voluntary and compliance, but in our view will be 80% compliance market. Article 6 and the Paris Agreement, Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 markets will sit on top of that. We already see huge activity on bilaterals. And with Article 6.4, you will start to see a market mechanism, but it doesn't stop there. Japan is introducing a market. Singapore already has that blend between a carbon tax and a project market. You have the Australian market. And if the European Union goes ahead with its plan of introducing CRCF, the carbon removal and farming mechanism, you will start to see actually large scale investments into removal capacity, into upgrades, into farming practices in some of the major developed economies to then blend an allowance system and a project system. That will give, I think, buyers the confidence to act. It will set price points that are very different level from today because the reference price will be the EU ETS or the Singapore carbon tax. That would also give the market the structure and the integrity move that I think a lot of buyers really want to see before they return at scale to the market. Then the third big shift that we obviously see is a world that has been dominated by avoidance credits to a world that will be, I think, a much stronger mix between avoidance. And we still believe avoidance has to play a super important role here. But clearly, removals is the topic that excites at the moment, large capital providers. And I think is a lot more aligned with where SPTI is going, where a lot of regulators are going. And I think it's really important to realize that creating removal capacity is a bit like long-term infrastructure investing. And so you need completely new players in this market. You need pension funds, infrastructure funds, large infrastructure developers because building a direct air capture facility or planting a large new forest somewhere is in profile and a capital commitment very similar to building a bridge, a motorway, an airport. And that is a huge shift for this industry that I think has been operating very close to what I would call the non-for-profit world to now mobilize the billions that you actually need in an infrastructure-like environment with 20-year capital commitments, 10, 15% IRR expectations. And that I see happening at the moment. But it's a fundamental change in the way that this industry needs to work if we want to reach the levels of investment that are anticipated. Thank you, Daniel. That was a very good analogy, actually. My next question is to do with Article 6. Obviously, we had some success in Baku at COP29. In fact, a lot of people were not expecting that to happen, but we did see rules, guidance and frameworks around Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 agreed. But since then, as we know, these things take time. But when do we really expect to see momentum growing? So Article 6 is number one priority for us. I think we have the luxury that we see a lot of activity in host countries and with buyer countries. Mind you, a bit more than 750 people in 30 countries. We work across 50, 60 countries with our project work. And so we engage a lot of governments around the world. I think what's happening in a very large number of host countries at the moment is getting the carbon market frameworks into a place where they can actually start to issue letters of authorization and actually get Article 6.2 and later Article 6.4 transactions on the way. And remind you, you also need this for the COSIA scheme and many other compliance schemes. So it's not surprising to me that this market feels slow at the moment. When we did the first Thailand-Switzerland transaction in 2023, we did one of the few follow-up transactions now between Ghana and Sweden. But if I look at our pipeline, it is very rich with the majority of large carbon market countries, carbon hosting countries essentially coming to market and more and more buyers coming. At the moment, you have the famous Sweden, Switzerland, and Singapore of the world. But you start to see a lot more action from countries in the European Union, from other large industrial countries in the Middle East and in Asia. Okay, thank you. And the other question I wanted to ask you about was, obviously, this market has been around for a long time. But one of the things we haven't necessarily seen in the last few years is the demand, the buyer interest. And I wanted to ask you some of your interactions with corporates and buyers in the last few years. What has been their reaction? When do you think this demand will really materialize? Yeah, I think that's the most important conversation to have, right? Unless there is real commitment to invest and make this market happen, we can spend as much time as we want talking about it. But the buyers are important, and you will have the same experience that I have at the moment. If you go to the big carbon market conferences and you ask in the room, who's actually a buyer? You have one hand go up, and that's normally from a tech company on the West Coast. I think that picture is a little bit misleading. If I look at our book, we transacted with probably a thousand corporates last year from all geographies and from all industries. So I think there is an element of green hushing going on. People aren't willing to step up and be seen as a buyer, but actually people are procuring. But very clearly, this needs to change, right? People, first of all, need to be confident that they can talk about this again. And second, they need to have the frameworks around them that they know that if they actually transact in this market, they're buying a product that is making their climate journey better and is not buying them a lot of reputational risk for the future. So I think in the run-up, especially to COP 30, which will be a very nature-centric, carbon market-centric COP, we need to give companies again the confidence to stand up and believe in this market. And the endorsement from large sovereigns and jurisdictional efforts, I think, is critical to give them the framework and the confidence to do so. And one question I had was, what would you say to a detractor, someone who has not been pro-carbon markets? How would you convince them to adopt? Because I think one of the main issues as well on this market has been it's quite divisive and quite polarizing. So what would you say to someone who was anti-carbon markets? How would you try and convince them otherwise? Yeah, for me, there are two responses here. One is the rational response. So at the moment, all evidence that we can see points to the fact that actually people that are engaging in the carbon market are also the ones that are much more active in changing business practices. And so the fear that offsetting is used in replacement of decarbonization isn't evidenced in data. The more general statement for me is, I think we're at a point in history where we need to endorse every tool that exists. We can spend a lot of time arguing, I think, with the current trajectory of emissions, the fact that we have just passed the 1.5 degree mark. It makes it so clear that we just need to do everything we can. That is a combination of decarbonizing at the pace that we can, keeping in mind all the conflicts and all the competing priorities that we have at the moment, and endorsing one of the most powerful market mechanisms to create the negative emissions capacity that we need to deliver in a net zero world. I think we have spent a lot of energy together to fight the two extremes, rather than recognizing that it's an and rather than an or, and I think we need to endorse that and. It's decarbonizing and creating negative emissions capacity. Okay, great. Thank you very much, Daniel, for joining us on the podcast. We very much appreciate your comments. My pleasure.

I'm your host, Taylor Kirkendall, and today we have a very special guest joining us for this episode, Jonathan Silver. Jonathan's one of the country's leading clean economy investors and advisors, is currently chairing the Global Climate Council at Apollo Global Management. Now, in that role, he guides the investment of $100 billion in sustainability-related transactions. Jonathan was also the executive director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Program Office during the Obama administration. See, Jonathan served as a senior official in three U.S. cabinets as well. That was Energy, Commerce, and Interior, and was an advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury. He recently joined Jigar Shah, who headed the loan office during the Biden administration, to launch a new sustainability-focused advisory firm called Multiplier. Multiplier's mission is to help a select group of high-quality, sustainability-focused companies accelerate their growth and reach commercialization. Jonathan recently sat down with me for a talk on the current clean energy financing landscape. All right, so let's dive into that enlightening conversation with Jonathan. Jonathan, thank you very much for coming on. Welcome to Energy Evolution. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Yeah, so just to kind of start off, I know you've got a new venture called Multiplier. Can you tell me a little bit about what Multiplier does and what you're doing in the work of clean energy startups? We're basically setting up a kind of a boutique advisory services business focused on early-stage companies in the sustainability-focused area. And really what we hope to do is bring an ability to help them make customer connections, grow their business, sort of turbocharge their business, and look to understand what they really have and how to exit most effectively. A lot of companies and a lot of entrepreneurs are building really great products and really great technologies, but they're not all seeing the light of day. And part of that has to do with the larger macro environment. Part of it has to do with the amount of capital they're raising and the runway they're on. And part of it has to do, we think, with understanding what the right and logical exits are that bring the technology forward and are successful for the entrepreneurs. So we'll be working with, it's a very small boutique, it's just the two of us. And we hope to bring our collective 40-plus years of experience in the space to benefit them. Excellent. And backing up and looking kind of broad, you know, we've had a recent change in the White House that means a lot of change in how people are viewing clean energy policies. Can you kind of just give us a lay of the land and what it looks like to invest in a clean energy company today compared to, say, six months ago? Well, maybe it's worth reflecting on exactly what the Trump administration has undertaken in the last 100 days, you know, as the first part of that answer. President Trump signed 20 executive orders on environmental policy alone in the last 100 days. Among them, I'm certainly not going to recite all of them by memory, but he declared a national energy emergency when, of course, there is no prices, and as you well know, fossil fuel production was at record highs. He withdrew from the Paris Accords. He opened up drilling on federal lands. He stopped offshore wind. He sunsetted a bunch of EPA regulations, the most important of which, of course, was the endangerment findings, dismantled the NEPA, you know, process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the larger context in which clean tech, climate tech, sustainability-focused companies now need to navigate. Now, having said that, it seems to me that actually there's a considerable amount of runway. The way the metaphor I sometimes use is of a train, you know, the climate and clean tech train has left the station. You can slow it down. You can maybe even bring it to a halt temporarily, but trains don't go backwards. And so really the only question is, what is the lag time now that the drag on the 20 executive orders has produced? Now, I'm wondering, too, you know, one of the big things that was different between this administration and the last administration is with artificial intelligence, we're seeing just kind of this unprecedented increase in electricity demand. How does that change the conversation? And does that maybe offer some reasons to be optimistic that there's still going to be a lot of like a runway to get some of these clean energy products and simply because we need so much energy right now? Oh, absolutely. I mean, the byword here, of course, is additionality, you know, an additive to the energy mix. And it really underscores the need, in a sense, for an all of the a real all of the above strategy. If you take you mentioned AI and I'll add to that EVs, heat pumps, bringing additional billions of people, energy sufficiency and another billion people, energy at all, etc. But if you start by thinking about hyperscale data centers, you hear a lot of conversation about them potentially being nuclear powered. I'm a big supporter of nuclear, but there's a disconnect there, right? Which is if you think that the AI war is an important war to win, whatever that means. But let's take that as the stipulate. That war is going to be won or lost in the next one, two, three years. But nuclear power for hyperscale data centers is a 10 year undertaking from here. It's that time at a minimum for a utility scale site. We don't have any commercially ready small modular reactors. And even if we did, in order to power a really large data center, you'd need multiples of them. So that knocks you back in a sense to gas, which is certainly a viable solution. But you know, as well as I do, the challenges in the supply chain there and the alternative potential uses for gas, including as exports. So you quickly get back to a renewables and storage may be actually the short to medium term solution for the additionality required through the use of hyperscale centers. Do you think that means that companies can kind of maybe rebrand their message? You know, like instead of talking about climate change, so much talking about this energy dominance theme. I was wondering, can you tell me a little bit about like how you would advise a company maybe to think about its messaging and are there any technologies that might be able to fit into this administration's goals, maybe it's better than some others in the clean energy space? Well, I think the real challenge is not the rebranding, per se, domestically. It's the balancing the multiple kinds of branding companies are going to need to do to sell both domestically and internationally. Outside the United States, the world is not taking the same tack that we're on. There's huge demand for and interest in and support for and financing available to companies working in and around clean tech and climate tech. So I don't know that vocabulary has changed much at all. Internally, of course, you're exactly right. It's funny, though, I don't really think of it so much as a marketing change as it should have been the way all of this was discussed from the beginning. The green revolution does multiple things and easily includes energy security. I don't really know what energy dominance means, but what I do know is we pumped more fossil fuel last year than ever before in the history of the country. So it's not as though we lack for domestic sources of power or our ability to sell any of these things globally. I do think that there are a lot of social ideas, social policy ideas that are being conflated with clean energy and climate change, which really have very little to do with those things. And so you've got to pick carefully. But as always, good products, good technologies and single point solutions pretty much trump, no pun intended, the Gordian knot of policy that the Trump administration has created here. Speaking broadly again, can you tell us a little bit about the important role that the federal government can play in helping along and accelerating these clean energy technologies and then maybe lay out a vision of what you see happening in the next two, three years, how that might change compared to what we saw, say, during the recent Biden administration? I think it's important to distinguish between a photograph and a movie, right? The photograph of today is a federal government aligned against projects and policies that support emissions reductions for a variety of good and not so good and ideological reasons. On the other hand, if you look at this as a movie, we've made an unbelievable amount of progress, often driven by public policy in introducing and expanding opportunities for emissions reductions. Way back when there was no Clean Water Act, there was no EPA, then there was an EPA, then there was a Clean Water Act, then there was a Clean Air Act, then there was a Mercury and Toxics Act, then there was an Endangerment Act, then there was the DOE Loan Program, then there was the IRA, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, public policy has played an important role in moving zero to low emissions technologies forward. I should say exactly as public policy did in earlier times for things like fracking technology was actually invented in federal labs. It was a joint venture with some other private sector entities, but the underlying technology was supported by the federal government. So there's been a long history of government support for emerging energy related technologies. And I think it's easy for people to boil a debate down into like, we want more regulation, we want less regulation, et cetera, but that's kind of what we're simplifying a bit, right? Like one of the things that I remember seeing you written about at one point was the idea that uncertainty was such a bigger challenge, right, rather than the regulation itself. Can you explain to our listeners a little bit about that, why uncertainty is such a huge problem for these companies out there that sometimes need to raise a whole lot of money for some of these projects? Sure. And by the way, it's of course true not just for clean tech, clean energy kinds of companies, but for all companies of all kinds in every field. I mean, the single greatest risk to business growth is uncertainty, uncertainty about public policy, uncertainty about financing, uncertainty about markets, uncertainty about access to markets, et cetera. And of course, the volatile and almost whimsical application and retraction of tariffs and other kinds of policies creating uncertainty in the market is hugely problematic for businesses. In fact, I'm sure you saw the last several days, a number of the larger automobile manufacturers simply tell the investment community, they could not make projections about what the rest of the year would look like. They didn't know how many cars they would sell. They didn't know whether they would open or close plants. They just have no sense of what to do. And of course, in an environment of that kind of volatility, the safest business decision is to do nothing. And you make a good point there about that applying to all businesses. We saw a slew of orders come out on trying to help the US coal industry and depending on how you read them, trying to keep just existing plants around, but maybe like offering some hope for a brand new plant. But I mean, like, do you think that kind of regulatory volatility plays in a decision like that? Do you envision anybody building a new coal plant or significantly investing in existing like coal fleet today based on the idea that we might see a completely new set of approach to the coal industry come three years from now? It's a great question. And obviously, you know, a lot about the coal industry as well, and perhaps more so more than I do, which would be easy. But what I would say is not unlike that train analogy, you can slow something down, but you can't really stop it. The truth is that renewable power and clean baseload power are increasingly economically competitive with and even better than cheaper than coal. And so while federal incentives may create an opportunity set and maybe even a mini boom, it's my guess that the mini boom really just means that fewer coal plants are shuttered over a time period that they were expected to shutter than would otherwise have been the case. But it doesn't stop the underlying trajectory. And the US is so big that it's policy effects, right? You can't really escape to uncertainty just by moving out of the US. I am wondering, do you envision companies say like wanting to put more investment in projects outside of the US right now, just because of all this political instability that we're seeing right now? I would guess so. I mean, the thing that is missing in the president, and there are many things that are wrong with the president Trump's executive orders and decision making, in my opinion. But the thing that is fundamentally missing from the approach is it takes just a minute to set up tariffs and to encourage domestic reshoring of manufacturing. But it takes a decade to actually bring those plants back, get them up and running, build out the infrastructure and the supply domestic supply chain to do that. So there's this chasm between the application of these policies and the realities on the ground of when the reshoring will reach critical mass to be able to produce sufficient numbers of items for domestic consumption. And that gap, that chasm is a giant problem for everybody, for consumers and for small and large companies, for everybody. I want to just to kind of pivot to something a little more optimistic, taking it, we're sitting here in 2025 and you're right, we don't need to, we don't need to talk about the challenges all the time. Let's talk about some opportunities as someone sitting in that space very closely to lots of exciting clean energy technologies. I'm just wondering, what are you excited about in 2025, whether it's a technology or optimism around like a certain policy that maybe we're not paying enough attention to, what are you excited about in clean energy right now? Well I always, I apologize for this, I always have the most boring answer to this question and that is everything and everything we're doing now. I mean, if you look at the opportunity set for solar, for wind, for battery storage, for EVs, just right down the line, all the things that we're already doing, we have just an enormous global opportunity set in front of us, to use a baseball analogy, I don't know if we're in the second inning or the third inning, but we're not in the eighth or ninth inning. We have lots and lots of opportunities. The next time you fly into almost any airport anywhere, look out the window and see if the warehouses around the airports have solar panels on them. Almost to a one, they don't. And that's just a tiny little illustration of a much larger opportunity set. If you're asking me about specific technologies that have maybe been not underrepresented but under invested in and perhaps lost a little bit in the shuffle over the next few years, I think water is just absolutely critical and going to be huge, both from a provision perspective like desal, but also water remediation, water cleaning, et cetera. I think a corollary to that is smart agriculture, where obviously there are folks working, but there's still a long way to go. And of course, we all know the stats about how important methane is there and other kinds of things, just crop yields, et cetera. Overall, as a theme, I think where companies are really just beginning in a meaningful and serious way to tackle circularity in their product design. And I think that's a huge opportunity as well. At the top of our conversation, we talked about multiplier. I'm wondering when you get to the end of 2025, or if we need to go a little further out, I'm just wondering when you look back at the initial months of this company, what would you define as a success measure? What's a big goal that you have for this company that you hope to achieve in say first 12 months? You're talking about multiplier? Yes. Yes. Oh, I don't. That's kind of you to ask. I don't think we have big goals. In fact, I think we have small goals. Really, it's just the two of us trying to work with a select group of high potential companies whose technologies we think are meaningful to where we all need to go, that we can help get there. So, I would describe success as a handful of those relationships with successful outcomes. Excellent. And then this is kind of the last question I asked, and you touched on this already because you mentioned that there are a lot of opportunities and we're early innings, as you say, but I'm just, where do you sit in terms of optimism that we're going to be able to push clean energy where we need to make it to meet global climate goals? And why are you optimistic or pessimistic about that? That's a complicated question. I say that because by temperament, I'm optimistic about this opportunity set. What I worry about these days more than I did before is really not about public policy per se or anything else. It's actually about tipping points in the natural world. If we really start down a sustained cycle of permafrost melt, where we can't really control methane release, if we can't get the fourth wave of coral bleaching under control, which now has already affected over 80% of coral reefs around the world, which of course are home to fish stocks and everything else, and a huge percentage of the world population derives its principal protein from fish, if we can't stop some of the natural cycles or mitigate what we're doing to slow that process down, the melting of the ice sheets so that the salinity of the water changes, so that the circularity of the ocean currents changes. If we can't stop this stuff, we have a much, much larger problem ahead of us. And so the reason to be so concerned about the Trump administration's policies is not just that they are bad for business or they create uncertainty, et cetera. It's that if they exacerbate to some tipping point, these changes in the natural world, then we have a real problem, a real problem ahead of us. And I guess just to follow up on that really quickly, too, we've seen a lot of cuts to climate and scientific research. Do you worry that maybe we won't even maybe necessarily understand some of those potential feedback mechanisms just because we're not spending as much, maybe say, researching these problems? Well, I think the jury is out on that, which may sound like a surprising answer. But what I mean by that is the federal government has played a critical role in scientific discovery and innovation and moving things from the lab out into the commercial marketplace in setting public policy to incentivize reductions in emissions, et cetera, et cetera. It's a given that it's critical. I believe it's so critical that some of the scientific work that the federal government has done will in fact be reinvented and recreated by the private sector almost by necessity. Do I think that's a smart thing to do? Not particularly. Do I think it's a it's accomplishable? I do. And so I'm unclear in my own mind how big a hit this will be in the short term. It's immense. Absolutely. And certainly things are moving fast. And while I keep watching, we're going to be back on the chat again sometime soon in the future.

Brought to you by S&P Global Commodity Insights. I'm your host Ikhlavi Gupte, and I'm thrilled to have you join us for this week's episode. Today, we are joined by a special guest, the Chief Energy Economist of the International Energy Agency, Tim Gold, who gives us his perspective on how geopolitics, economics and trade tensions are impacting the increasingly volatile and multifaceted energy markets. He also talks about how the world is entering a new era of energy security due to the changing nature and multiple dimensions of today's energy markets spurred by the rapid growth of renewables. Founded in 1974, in the wake of the Suez oil crisis, the IEA has long been a cornerstone of global energy security. The agency provides critical policy recommendations, analysis and data to its member countries, mainly from the OECD bloc. However, the IEA has faced significant scrutiny from fossil fuel producers, especially after it released its 2021 Net Zero by 2050 report, which asserted that achieving the Paris Agreement's climate targets would necessitate halting new oil and gas upstream projects. It has also been sharply criticized for some in the industry for its World Energy Outlook forecast that oil demand will peak before the end of this decade. Yet, despite the pushback, the IEA remains resolute in its stance that the energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, heralding the emergence of a new age of electricity. The IEA estimates that global electricity demand will increase six times higher than global energy demand over the next 10 years. In this interview, which was conducted on the sidelines of the Summit of the Future of Energy Security, which took place in London from April 24th to the 25th, Tim dwells deep into some of the pressing issues that the IEA is monitoring as energy markets continue their tumultuous journey. So, without further ado, let's jump straight into the conversation with IEA's Tim Gold. There's always been multiple moving parts in the energy system. But I think it's also true that over the last few years, we've had a pretty turbulent ride in energy markets all the way back to disruptions during COVID. And then after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the price spikes that we saw after, particularly after pipeline gas supply was cut to Europe, and then the reverberations, implications that had for global markets, also for electricity prices, given that gas is the sort of price setting, the marginal source of generation in many countries. And then even today, we're moving into a world of new uncertainties, uncertainties on geopolitics, uncertainties on the rate of economic growth, uncertainties on trade. But I think one of the reasons why we've had an important gathering here at this summit on the future of global energy security is because it was a good moment to bring a really wide range of countries together to map out some of those issues and to talk through what are the areas that countries need to be working together on to improve security in the future. But in terms of our own work, and the difficulty there is to talk about market developments, we in the end, we come back to the data, we try and bring together as many data points as we can, both in terms of the broader economy, but then what is happening in energy markets. And I think when it comes to some near term developments, I look back to last year, we called quite early on that we felt that global oil demand growth could come in at less than 1 million barrels a day. At the time, many felt that oil would grow more strongly, and some felt it would grow much more strongly than that. But as the data came in, and as we went through the year, I think that this approach that we took, the numbers that we were talking about, were vindicated by the way things turned out. But let's be honest about where we start this discussion from. We have some quite significant overall growth in energy demand. It's been driven largely by electricity. So electricity demand last year grew by more than 4%, so significantly faster than the rate of overall GDP growth. And I think one of the things that we're looking out for very closely is what are the implications then of that shift towards a more electricity rich system? What does that mean for policy? What does that mean for security? Because there's a host of potentially new electricity security issues that governments need to be focused on. And again, that's been a really big topic of discussion. Thank you. One of the things Dr. Birol mentioned yesterday in one of his speeches was how you have to look at energy security quite differently now, especially as you mentioned with electricity, but also with critical minerals. So how do you see this sort of landscape changing, and are governments and companies listening to this? And does the IEA have any plans as well? Because obviously you're formed as a sort of bulwark to ensure oil supply security, and could we see more initiatives in critical minerals or electricity, as you mentioned? So definitely, and I think that's a process that's already visible if you look back at the way that the IEA has evolved over the years. We're essentially 50 years old. We were founded in the wake of the first oil crisis, as you rightly say, with a focus on oil supply security, managing the stockholding requirements that we have of member countries, and then making that available to the market in a coordinated way in the case of disruptions. Oil security remains foundational for the work that we do, but there's a lot of work also on natural gas. There's a lot of work, an increasing amount of work, on different electricity security issues around infrastructure, around flexibility, around managing the integration of new sources of electricity, particularly intermittent ones like wind and solar. There's a host of new resource and geopolitical issues around clean energy supply chains. And I think the high degree of concentration that you have in the critical mineral space, particularly in the midstream, so the refining and processing of critical minerals, that's a big topic of discussion here. There's a couple of things that I think we need to be aware of there. One is that it's a different type of security issue from your traditional fuel security discussion, because when there's a price spike for oil or for gas, that affects everyone that uses the fuel. If there's a shortage of a critical mineral or a technology, that can affect the speed at which new technologies or the cost of bringing new technologies into the system. But if you have an existing wind turbine or an existing solar panel, you're not affected by the shortage of a mineral because you've already got that in place. And I think that speaks to some of the paradigm shift that you're seeing in the system as a whole. And you're moving from a world which is highly OPEX-driven, so where fuel costs, those recurring fuel costs, are really a fundamental part of the system, to one that's much more CAPEX-driven, where if you've got the ability to bring some new technologies into the system, then your operating costs for those technologies are considerably lower than many of the incumbent technologies. Now, that process is not complete by any means, and those sort of different elements coexist in interesting ways. But that's quite an important area in which a new type of energy system will be fundamentally different from the one that we've had up until today. Okay. And you mentioned, obviously, critical minerals, where there's a huge concentration, I guess, especially in a place like China. But do you see a bit more progress in other parts of the world? So, again, it's a really interesting question. And I guess the fact is that the high degree of concentration that we see in those markets today, to a degree on the extractive side, but particularly in the midstream, that didn't happen overnight. That's happened over a period of many years. And it's not going to disappear overnight either. And our latest analysis, when we look at all of the projects that have been announced, but also the projects that have been implemented today, is that most of the new supplies of battery metals in particular, but also of rare earths, most of the new supplies are coming from the big producers. So we're not seeing, in most cases, we're not seeing a reduction in that level of concentration. That said, there is a more diversified portfolio of projects that are on the different stages of planning, and some of them are coming to market as well. And there's a lot of efforts to try and introduce a new set of partnerships around critical mineral resource development. And again, that's been a big focus for the discussions today. But when you have a very concentrated market, there are market risks. There are really large market risks for new market entrants. And so one of the really interesting policy discussions is, so what sort of instruments, what sort of tools can governments use in order to allow the market to work, but provide some degree of security then for those investments? And to allow them to get a foothold in a challenging market environment where, to be frank, right now, prices for many of those battery metals are relatively low. Now, just one question, how are tariffs and geopolitical tensions affecting energy markets currently, according to you? Especially, and I know you look more on the investment side, or you focus a lot on the investment and supply side. So it'd be just good to get your view. So I think it's a little bit early to talk definitively about the implications, but I can give you an idea of the sorts of things we're looking out for. So one is, in some cases, you're going to have higher costs for projects in certain jurisdictions. And that is going to affect then the cost competitiveness of some of those projects. It may affect the location, the preferred location for some investments. And so we're keeping a close eye out for those kinds of shifts. But I think there's a few moves beyond the direct implications of higher tariffs. I think there's a broader set of investment issues around just this climate of uncertainty over the prospects for growth and the prospects for sort of collaboration in different areas. And I think if you've got an existing project that you're committed to, then we don't see any signs of people backing away from stuff they're already implementing. But what we're also looking out for, is there going to be any hesitation on new FIDs in certain areas? Or are companies going to adopt a bit of a wait-and-see approach and try to get a bit more clarity on the way that this might play out and the speed at which the economy might grow this year before really committing to big new projects? So those are the sorts of areas that we're watching. Again, we're looking closely at some of the earnings calls and some of the ways that companies are talking about their response to the changed environment. But I think it's still a bit too soon to reach any definitive conclusions on that. And are there particular industries you think are more prone to what we're seeing right now, like renewables or critical minerals or even oil and gas? But some of the fluctuations in prices that we've seen, especially recently, oil again, is it too early to tell? My view is that one of the ones to watch is certainly the US shale patch, because they are quite responsive to changes in price. And it's interesting to see whether the sort of price levels that we have today is going to bring any significant reduction in activity. Again, it's a little bit early to talk definitively about that. But I think that's a little bit of a bellwether for just for the oil and gas side. In other areas, I tend to think that on the renewable side, in particular, these tend to be investments that are less directly responsive to price stimulant. I think as a general rule, companies in the energy sector in particular, they have to think for the long term. And so by and large, when you take a decision to move ahead with a project, you're very likely to stick with it in the knowledge that there are going to be cycles that you're going to be riding through along the way. The IEA has come under some pressure in recent years from certain governments on the net zero agenda. So yeah, how is IEA navigating that? And yeah, just be good to find out how that's worked out. Because obviously, now with the US government, quite different from the previous administration in terms of its energy and climate policy. So I think the let's come back to some sort of some basics for us as an international organization. So we respond to the mandates that are given to us by our member governments. And those are agreed in ministerial meetings, which we hold on a reasonably regular basis. And that then sets the direction of our work. And that's determined also the sort of work streams and activities that we pursue. And we'll have another ministerial meeting next year. And that will do the same thing for the next two year period. But I think within our constituency, within the IEA, there's a strong agreement that energy security is foundational for the IEA. But there's also a very strong recognition that the way that you safeguard energy security in a changing world needs to adapt. And we need to also be thinking about the risks that come from a changing climate, from a changing model of a more electrified system. And so I think there's a broad recognition that those are areas that the IEA will very much continue to focus on as we move forward. And I think there's a couple of other elements. We're in a world of interdependence, as the IEA executive director has made very clear. And we cannot resolve the issues that we face only by talking amongst ourselves within the IEA. So the partnerships that we have with other emerging developing economies, with Brazil, with South Africa, with Malaysia, with Indonesia, with a whole host of countries that are also represented here today, with Kenya, with Senegal, those are fundamental also to our ability to deliver on those mandates. So you can expect to see us very much focused on that broad definition of security, but also then on the broad dialogue with different countries. I think that's it. But if there's anything else you would like to add, please go ahead. No, I think maybe it's worth reflecting on the golden rules, as Fatih mentioned in his speech yesterday about energy security. Because I think there was a lot of speakers then came back to that. And I think we sort of coalesced around these three baskets of issues. So one of them being the importance of diversification. And that obviously applies to your traditional energy sources. And Europe has realized the cost of a high dependence on a single supplier for gas. And I think you can generalize that importance of the importance of diversity also when you think about the clean energy supply chains. And then the second thing is a recognition that in the end, energy security is about investment. And it's about the ability of also of private sector participants to invest large amounts of money in new projects. And they need some visibility on the direction of travel, but also some predictability in terms of the conditions that will apply to those investments. And then finally, he's emphasized over and over again that we're in this together. We're talking about elements of security that are common, that are shared, that can be best dealt with together. Because also when it comes to emissions, they're a common problem. And so there's that fundamental need for countries to come together as we've been doing here. Cool. Oh, that's great.

I'm your host, Taylor Kirkendall, and today we're talking about the challenge of scaling up climate tech innovation. I was recently invited to moderate a panel for the TomTom Festival, and that's here where I live in Charlottesville, Virginia. Well, the festival is this big, broad community event featuring lots of music and art, but it also has sessions on the future of the community and some people gathering to talk about big ideas. See, Charlottesville happens to be home to a few companies centered on energy and the climate, so that was part of the discussion. Essentially, the question at the heart of our chat was a critical question. How do we fund the solutions to climate change? The panelists tackled the complexities of measuring climate impact and the importance of transparency and forecasting. They also emphasized a need to understand the externalities of climate solutions and how businesses can better communicate their value propositions to investors and the public. The conversation also ventured into the future of climate tech, with panelists expressing a lot of optimism about innovative financing structures and the potential for nature-based solutions to be a part of the answer as well. They also acknowledged the challenges posed by fluctuating policies and market dynamics, given today's political climate in the United States in particular, but remained hopeful about the resilience and creativity that can be found within the sector. So first, who were the speakers on this panel? The panelists I was able to speak with at the event included Anne Clawson, a principal of Cascade Advisory, Bettina Ring, the Virginia State Director for the Nature Conservancy, Gilman Colson, founder and CEO of analytics firm Row Impact, and Michael Bobbin. He is the Senior Director of Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory at DNV. Now, since the U.S. election, it's been a pretty volatile and turbulent time in the markets. That makes navigating policy and financing a bit more challenging than usual. Here's Anne Clawson, principal of Cascade Advisory, on some of the challenges that companies are facing now. I mean, I think when we're talking about government funding and government non-diluted funding that's interesting for climate tech, now is probably as unsettled a time as we've ever seen. So I'll use now as an example. What we are seeing is that a lot of companies don't know if they still have grants they've been alerted. They don't know if the various clean energy tax credits are still going to be in place after this new tax bill is done. What we've seen companies do really well is raise awareness about their at-risk funding. So raising awareness with their members of Congress, raising awareness with the presidential administration, with the local community. And the more people know about it and know about the jobs that might be at risk, know about the benefits to the community that might be at risk, the better a chance that something gets solved. I think Tim Cook might be the best example today of that. The big reciprocal tariffs were put in place. Apple, I think, famously flew five jets worth of iPhones over from China in anticipation of those tariffs. And after a few phone calls where Tim Cook explained the importance of those tariff exemptions to the company, one of the three largest in the world, he was exempted from the tariffs. And I think that's illustrative of how being persuasive can really help you overcome these hurdles. There's another significant challenge that Gilman, the founder of Roe Analytics, firm brought up as well. Financial systems often don't align with the needs of new climate innovations. Gilman said there are often mismatches in timelines and return on investment that can slow dollars flowing into this space. One of the big challenges that you've seen, we've been at this for about eight years now. We are constantly advocating for and trying to support new climate innovations coming to market. And one of the big challenges that we see happening is the financial systems and structures that we have aren't well suited in many cases to new climate innovations because of timeline mismatches, ROI mismatches, and just the ways in which the math works out in the Excel spreadsheet. These climate innovations read capital. They tend to need quite a lot of capital. We're talking about real large facility buildouts, new technologies that are having to overcome a lot of hurdles under the R&D. And the payback period tends to be much longer than even the life cycle of a venture fund. We may be talking about a decade before you even expect to see returns and a venture fund is only around for 10 years. And that mismatch has been a very large part of a lot of failures that we've seen where they're trying to find venture capital that it's just not happening. And it's not necessarily because they don't want it to happen, but the math doesn't work out. And so new ways of funding is really important and kind of catalytic capital is a big one. Blended finance is a big one. Having offtake partnerships already in place before you even get into the R&D phases is important. So thinking more creatively about the modes of funding, I think is important. And we have a lot of work to be able to take me a long time to learn that lesson, frankly. So I think that's a big challenge still. Now, adding to the challenge, Gillen warned, is that the full costs and benefits of technology are often not a part of the equation. One of the biggest problems that I still see is that we completely fail to price in externalities into anything. And it's giving a leg up to incumbents, 10 tons out of 10, that makes it much more difficult to seal a new solution to the point where we literally have subsidies for gasoline at the pump globally, a lot of subsidies for oil to be there. And it's incredible to me. We also don't price in any of the externalities around downstream waste. So once a company has shipped something out of their door, it's not their problem anymore. It doesn't matter what's in it, how difficult it is to deal with it afterwards. None of that is their cost anymore. It's society's cost. And I think that's something that I hope we can figure out. I certainly don't have an answer. I just wanted to pose it as until we start to properly price externalities into the way in which we live, we're still in an uphill battle, and it's always going to be slower than we want it to be. And new genuine innovations are always working with one hand tied behind their back. So I hope to see that more in the narrative and more ways to address it. See, forecasting in the energy sector is notoriously challenging, and it's due to a multitude of unpredictable variables, from fluctuating demand driven by economic changes and seasonal weather patterns to the rapid evolution of technology and regulatory landscapes. Energy forecasts have to navigate a very complex web of influences. Additionally, geopolitical events can have immediate impact on supply chains and energy prices, further complicating these predictions. Now, the integration of renewable energy resources, which are intermittent by nature, adds a completely new layer of uncertainty, as their output can vary significantly from day to day. Here's Michael Bobbin, who shares his perspective on forecasting as someone who's done a lot of work as a technical advisory for M&A transactions for renewable energy projects. It's something that a lot of inputs go into from a technical perspective. It can be very difficult. The sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always glow. How do you look at that? How can you model that? So that's a big hurdle that we're continuously doing and which everyone kind of knows a forecast. You're never right. It's just how wrong are you? So we continuously look at that, update our models. And the big thing that we try to do is we try to validate that. So the big way that we try to get around that hurdle and get better at it is you do that energy assessment in a pre-construction phase, development phase. And now, years later, you have to get that data, the actual operational data. You look at that from three, five years. How did it do? How did that do compared to your forecast? And then you go back in, and it's really that tuning the model, that validation, where you're able to get over that hurdle and at least get more confidence, understand what's going on as technology keeps evolving and things keep changing. And that all is the biggest driver in any financial model is really the revenue forecast and the energy production forecast. Even those in the business of forecasting energy will readily admit it is a difficult proposition. Here's Gilman with data analytics firm Roe Impact once again. Every forecast is a guess, period. We just don't know. So it's all about reducing the amount of wrongness you have. One of the things that we fixate on is transparency in assumptions, like what knobs did you turn to get at it? So that you can reliably and repeatedly make the same type of forecast by adjusting the same knobs after you've learned from field data, after you've learned new things and have new inputs. But you're not recreating this model each time to kind of soup the new data. You're turning the same knobs and you have very clear transparency to what assumptions went into it. We live in an imperfect world. We operate on imperfect information. And so it's all about knowing where did you just have to guess and not being afraid to say it. And I think that's something that when you're not used to forecasting, you come into it hoping that you can have all the answers and have a very specific viewpoint on every single input. That's not the case. In climate, I think there is a group that I respect deeply called probable futures. I would encourage everybody to look it up. I've flooded them anytime that I can. Spencer Blendon, who founded that group, has a very important concept in climate that just resonates with me, which is one of the biggest issues with climate change is instability. That's really what it's introducing into the system, right? Yes, there's heat and there's rising sea levels and there are very real problems. But one of the fundamental kind of underpinnings of it is an increased instability. And that makes forecasting very difficult. It's exactly like you were talking about, especially if you're talking about a physical asset that has a 20, 30, 40 year operational cycle. What's going to happen then when we can barely figure out what's happening next year, five years? And so one of the ways that I think climate solutions address that and one of the things that I'm excited about is most climate solutions focus on sustainability. Sustainability through one lens is reducing externalities. So reducing the amount of other materials and other energy and other dependencies that you have. The more that you can reduce that, the more sustainable solution tends to be, if not one to one. So when we're modeling things, we're focused on that. What are the externalities? How can you model them? How certain are you in them? Being very transparent when you just don't know. And if you know with some uncertainty, being very clear about that. Nature-based solutions are also emerging as a vital component in the climate change discussion, offering innovative ways to mitigate the impacts of global warming while enhancing biodiversity. The solutions leverage natural processes to sequester carbon, restore ecosystems, and improve resilience against climate-related threats. For example, reforestation efforts not only capture carbon dioxide, but also provide habitats for wildlife and improve air quality. Wetland restoration can reduce flooding risk and enhance water quality, while sustainable agricultural practices can increase soil health and productivity. I wanted to share a piece of the conversation with Bettina Ring. She's the Virginia State Director of the Nature Conservancy. I wanted to hear a little bit about the work that that organization is doing through a program called NatureVest. So the Nature Conservancy has been around for some time here in Virginia. We've been in place from the early 60s. And so there's a long history of credibility in various places across the U.S. in particular, and then later we evolved to being an international organization. With NatureVest, we also had an opportunity to stand up a mechanism that allows us to do more creative financing and to really start to bring in impact investment for conservation and to have it embedded in some other work that we're doing around impact finance and a larger approach thinking about other ways to ensure that we're bringing business in to the work that we're doing and advancing our 2030 goals. And so what's really exciting, we're very focused on addressing a change in climate and biodiversity loss. And so that remains our core mission in making sure that we're having thriving communities and people across the planet. In the earlier session, there were some questions around people and how you think about that. What's really nice is that, again, that three-legged stool around the social component as well as economic and protecting the environment. With NatureVest, one of the great examples, and I transitioned from being State Forester to Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, one of the Nature Conservancy, was protecting the Cumberland Forest, and that's over three states, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. And it's over 253,000 acres that have been protected, very important lands, through private investment, through NatureVest working in partnership with the Nature Conservancy state chapters in those three states, and being able to have this return on investment, which is really exciting. We're able to protect conservation. We have sustainable forest management on these lands. We also have, we're beginning to put solar on reclaimed minelands, and so continued ways to have that return on investment for those that were early adopters and were in this with us. And it's really exciting to see the evolution of that, and also to see as that community in southwest Virginia gets away from, and in Kentucky, and then the Eduphina Sea, gets away from being dependent upon fossil fuels, and looking at natural resources as being a true asset, and outdoor recreation opportunities. So it's really exciting to be able to work in that place. And it's part of the Appalachians, from Canada all the way down to Alabama, and that's one of four global priorities for the Nature Conservancy, a really important migratory route, and being able to protect that much land, and doing it through creative financing, really sets up the ability to do more of that in the future. So we're reporting out, we're learning from that, and then we're also trying to replicate that in other places. I'm an optimist, so I try to always remain hopeful about the future. We also currently have a climate grant that we're very excited about, related to storing carbon. And we're doing this across four states. It's Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and we're doing that through peatland restoration and acquisition of peatland, as well as restoring those peatlands. And then also bottom line hardwood for us, doing more work in the Appalachians, and very excited about that, as well as wetlands. And so the combination and the fact that we have four states, and it's a very bicartisan sort of collaboration with each of our state governments, as well. We're really excited to move forward with that collaborative effort, and just how we're working together, how we're thinking about that, how we're leveraging private dollars with that, too, and the impact that we're going to be able to have on the ground. And we're not going to be purchasing credits through this. We're doing things a little bit differently. We're working with Duke University and some others, and had some really innovative carbon analysis, and being able to track that over the period of the five-year grant, but also beyond that, for 20 years total. And so building into, learning into, again, all of these projects that we have. And so really, again, thinking about leveraging both public funding, and we know that that may be changing over time, but also with corporate funding, and then private investment, and sort of that impact investment. And being able to also look at blue carbon, and we're doing more of that on the global front, as well as some opportunities here in Virginia with some eelgrass restoration we've been doing, we've been doing also in partnership with the University of Virginia, and with William & Mary. And so more to come on that, but really hopeful about the future, and continuing to think about how do we build relationships, maintain those trust relationships, how do we be true to our mission, and not do off course chasing other funding issues. As we talked about on the show before, the current administration is not in favor of advancing the same energy projects as the Biden administration. Trump's touted oil, and gas, and coal, for example, and made efforts to increase production of each. However, Anne said clean energy projects can still move forward if they're being framed in the right way. Every administration has priorities that they're interested in, and the trick is how do you think about what you're working on, and think about where there's an intersection between your project and the administration's priorities. With the Biden administration, that was very clearly clean energy, and the energy transition. With this administration, that's much less of a focus. Anne said there's a focus on national security, there's a focus on onshore. And so if I take Critical Minerals as an example, in the previous administration, Critical Minerals companies were focused on their value to the electric vehicle supply chain, or to the energy transition supply chain. Now those same companies are saying, okay, that's not important to this administration. What is important to this administration? The answer is reducing the country's reliance on China as essentially a single supplier for the entire flow for Critical Minerals. So this same Critical Minerals company maybe won't be getting that electric vehicle funding, but may find that there's an interest from the Department of Defense in funding for national security purposes to develop a critical mineral supply chain here. And so I think that's an example of how companies can reframe what they're doing. I think another thing I would say that is agnostic of time and place is that you were talking about how venture funding, Gilman, doesn't align with how startups in the clean energy space have experienced their timescales, right? I think there's an opposite problem with government funding. Startups that do get funded are under a lot of pressure to demonstrate success before their next fundraise, demonstrate success before the next fundraise. And so every one to two years, like 12 to 24 months, they need to show results. And the government doesn't work that fast. And so I think what can be tricky is if you're in a startup and you're looking for government funding, but you're only able to focus on what's six to 12 months ahead, it's going to be difficult for you to position for government funding that might be a perfect fit for you, but might not show up in your bank account until two or three years down the road. So the reality is that startups and really anyone who's in this space needs to start thinking about government funding probably a year or two before you think you do. And then you'll be in a much better place to actually get the funding when you need it and put the funding to use. And to do that, you have to overcome that timescale focus and you have to be able to start that work stream a little bit earlier. And that might be a tough adjustment. However, while there are opportunities to address messaging and emphasize that a company also must stay true to its core mission. I feel pretty strongly that an organization is going to do best when it is clear on what its mission and values and objectives are. And I believe that it is ultimately detrimental to the business to chase policy and to chase funding. So if you're changing the research you're doing, if you need to do some research to solve a certain technical objective for your business, and the government wants you to go in a different direction, if you want to get funding, and it's going to mean that you're not going to solve your business objective, so it's not going to help you to go after that funding, you might get money, but it's not useful money. And by the same token, if you are able to say, because most climate tech is both and has a climate benefit, and then it's serving some business purpose, right, it's making some business process better somehow. And if you can talk about that other business purpose to the administration, and not talk about climate, but you're still true to your mission and vision, and you're still accurately conveying what your company does, that's fantastic. I think when you stop accurately conveying what your company does, you run the risk of maybe saying one thing to your customer, another thing to your investors, a third thing to the government, a fourth thing to your mother and father, it just becomes very difficult for you to keep all of these different messages straight. And so the more you can be consistent and truthful and accurate in your message, I think the more successful you're going to be and also because a lot of us here are in the mission driven space, you're going to feel more personally fulfilled, right? So I think there's a way where you can strategize and say, where can I find overlap? How can I get this person, this office, this priority, whatever to resonate with what my goal is, but at a certain point, there may just not be a match and you need to be okay with that. Okay. So let's say you have a great energy transition idea, what's it going to take to attract the attention of investors or a potential acquirer? Michael Bobbin of DMV laid that out for our audience as well. What you do right now, you're looking to get acquired. So you have to have a good business case, you have to present well, of course. So it's all about that business case, it's all about that financial model and how you back that up. You're going to want some polish, of course, and good marketing material. But after you go through that, you have your management presentation or whatever you have. Like what we look at from that technical perspective and the advice I would get is a really well populated what we call a virtual data room. So where you have all of that information about the company. So like, what is your business case? What is your secret sauce? What can you do that nobody else can do? Okay, that's great. And now prove it through the data that you have. So the big thing that we then do is we come through all that data and we say, okay, well, you said that you're doing this. Where are you with respect to industry? And what does that actually look like? And then we'll give that, we'll help with that evaluation and get that information. So a lot of that has to do with things like, okay, you have 50 gigawatts of pipeline in your solar and wind developer, for instance. What does that mean? Is that real? Or is that not? Are those bragawatts you compare? Are they real? Are they real? That's what we call them and what is that 50 gigawatts actually mean? Well, what it means is they talked to a bunch of landowners and they're, you know, 20 gigawatts of that. They have some land leases that are not even, you know, inked yet. So what does that really mean? Or do they actually have interconnection hues? Do they have the permitting matrix that's really filled out and they actually have all their permits ready? Do they have a procurement strategy and what is that? And do they have anything locked up? Do they have solar panels locked up? Do they have the wind turbines, inverters, main power transformers? Whatever that is. So really then just combing through that and like, okay, well, yeah, you have this much that is potential, but that's not actually worth anything with respect to an evaluation unless it actually is material and you can plug it in and it has some sort of value to that investor. Because whenever you're looking at it from either the IPP developer, financier point of view, they all have the finance team, they all have that financial model. And at the end of the day, they're going to make that decision based on however that model looks. Okay. So that gives you a pretty good feel for our panel discussion. It's clear that climate finance is not just a challenge, but an opportunity for innovation and collaboration. While the current political and economic landscape presents hurdles, the resilience and adaptability of those in the climate tech sector continues and there is quite a bit of optimism for continuing to scale up these technologies.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-22\n==================================================\n\n### Charting a new course: The global deal that aims to make shipping green\n**Episode ID:** 5075\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985824\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the Energy Evolution Podcast, where we explore the critical moments shaping our energy future. I'm your host, Eklavya Gupte, and in this episode, we will be discussing the outcome from the recent International Maritime Organization meeting, where parties approved new regulations aimed at charging for greenhouse gas emissions from ships. This move will have a rippling effect on not just the maritime sector and its decarbonization initiatives, but also on global trade and the broader energy transition. After weeks of tense high-pressure talks, with strong opposition from several countries, notably some key oil and gas producers, draft regulations that set a mandatory marine fuel standard and a mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions pricing for shipping were agreed. But getting to this decision was not without contention. The U.S. withdrew from the discussions, citing concerns that the regulations would impose an economic burden. Saudi Arabia, alongside other fossil fuel-dependent nations, also opposed the rules. But the vote ultimately passed with a significant majority, which can be viewed as a triumph of multilateralism. To speak with us in more detail on the complexity of these regulations, we have Max Lin, a senior journalist in our EMEA news team. Welcome, Max. Now, you've been following these IMO meetings for several years now, so it would be great to find out what were some of the achievements from this session and what do they mean for the maritime sector? Thank you, Eklavvya. Yes, indeed, as you say, this is a landmark achievement by the International Maritime Organization because this is going to be a regulation that will be enforced by more than 100 countries on international shipping. And this is the first sector-wide greenhouse gas emission rules on international maritime transportation. So what we are going to see is that shipping companies will need to use marine fuels with lower greenhouse gas emission intensities. And this is because the International Maritime Organization has set decarbonization targets for 2030, 2040, and all the way to a net zero by 2050. And we are going to see the bunker industries struggle to prepare all those low-carbon fuels because right now those low-carbon fuels are very scarce and they cost much more, two or three times more than conventional fuels. So this is a very significant development for shipping and the bunker companies. And obviously, as you mentioned, there have been contentious debates among all the member states of the INOs. And we are still going to look out to whether the U.S. and Saudi Arabia will do something more to prevent the adoption of this regulation in the INO's next meeting in October. Thanks, Max. And some of the reaction so far has been centered around the complexity of the regulations and also on the fact that these regulations will still need to be adopted. So what is your take on that? Yes, I think in my 10 years of reporting on this topic, this is probably the most complex regulation that I have ever accounted. So we are going to have like two sets of greenhouse gas emission standards for marine fuels at any given year. And at the same time, the ship operators that could meet the highest standard, which means if they are burning zero-emission fuels, they will even be able to generate something called surplus unit, which is kind of like a carbon credit for the shipping industry. They can sell those to under-compliant ship operators. So we are going to see the shipping company face a very difficult choice between which fuels to use. And this is something that they've been thinking over for the past few years because they are trying to figure out whether they should stay with oil or they should be shipped to LNG or ammonia or even methanol. So we are going to see the shipping company putting more monies into studying what kind of fuels is the best for them economically. But I think more importantly, we also need to recognize that this is a significant achievement in terms of environmental protection, especially as they are trying to make a move in countering climate change. And this is like a very big change from industry that has been criticized for being a laggard in low-carbon transition. Thanks a lot, Max. And Max and I were lucky to speak to two experts on their reactions from this landmark decision. First, we spoke to Edmund Hughes, the IMO representative at the International Bunker Industry Association. Edmund, welcome to Energy Evolution. So to kick things off, it would be great to get a sort of insider's view into some of the drama that unfolded at the recent MEPC meeting in what looked like quite tense negotiations, but with a successful outcome in the end, some would say. Yes, and thank you very much indeed for inviting me. Indeed, it was tense, but then that's a result of when you get 176 or so member states coming together to negotiate international global rules for international shipping. And really, the two-week process that we had in London recently was the culmination of nearly two years' work following the adoption of the IMO strategy in 2023 that set the levels of ambition, including to reach net zero by around 2050. But the fact is that international shipping and these rules that have been agreed will impact not just shipping, but have a knock-on effect to the production of fuels and technologies to support the net zero goal as we go forward. And this, again, has significant geopolitical issues because trade also has an impact on many countries. So all these were at play, really, in terms of the consideration of the governments who made the decisions. And as I said, I think it really demonstrates ultimately a positive for both IMO and international shipping, but also multilateralism, which is a very good outcome. Definitely, especially in a time where you're having so many geopolitical tensions and the sort of tariff drama that we're seeing unfold. But in terms of the reaction from the shipping industry, I know it's a bit too early to tell, but what have been some of the immediate reactions from the sector? Yeah, indeed. And I mean, the industry itself and individual companies within the industry is very much still digesting the outcome and working out the implications on a company basis across the sector. But I think in general, most players within the sector are very happy with the outcome because, importantly, what it does is give certainty to the future. One thing that many were calling, including myself, was the need for certainty because without the regulatory certainty, whilst we had the goals, they were understood. Without the regulatory certainty, it gives certainty to the investment decisions that are going to be needed, whether it be a fuel producer, an equipment manufacturer, a shipbuilder, a ship owner primarily who are making the investments, but also the investors as well who support the sector and the producers. Ultimately, it was a clear signal to them that we're able to move forward now on the basis of mandatory requirements. And that is a significant difference. And why, again, going back to your first question, why there was a lot on this meeting because those mandatory requirements give that certainty. But if they hadn't been agreed to this session, then frankly, we had real risk of missing not just the 2030 target, but likely the 2040 and the 2050 target. So this is why it was such a big meeting. Hi, Edmund. And I was also thinking, because we have a rather complex regulatory piece, we have two tiers of penalty. We have a carbon trading mechanism. Do you think that bunker companies will also need to adjust their commercial strategies to face this kind of new business environment? Undoubtedly. I mean, I think one of the things that came out of the event, and I represent IBIA, the International Bunker Industry Association at the IMO. And one thing that IBIA's membership is very aware of is the change that this whole regulatory framework will bring to the marine fuel supply chain, in that we're moving away from where we just focused on tank to wake emissions. That is, once the fuel is supplied to the ship, it's just the emissions that come out of the stack of the ship. All the way now, we're now looking at a world to wake governance regime, whereby we also have to take into account the upstream emissions from the production of the fuels and energy sources. And they have to be incorporated into the calculation of the attained fuel intensity for the ship. And that involves, therefore, a whole process of information flowing from upstream through the bunker supplier or the energy supplier through to the ship. That will change the governance regime, not just for the ship owner, but also the supplier of the fuel, but also the fuel producer. And IBIA and its membership, and we represent stakeholders across that whole marine fuel supply chain, are going to have to understand the implications for them, because many of them will have to now be certified by recognized certification bodies for these fuels, for the sustainability aspects of these fuels, and for the ability to provide that information that's going to be needed. So the whole supply chain is going to have to be reconfigured to enable, ensure, and ensure this information can be received by the vessel. And obviously, those new rules are going to be implemented from 2028. So how do you see that between now and 2028, how should the industry start to prepare for these rules? I think at this stage, people are assessing the rules and their implications. We still have a hurdle to overcome in October with the adoption of the rules. And that, I would imagine, will end up with another vote, because that is the nature of these things. We know that it's already been signaled by countries that that's likely to happen. And again, the dynamic slightly changes in October, because whereas this decision was made on Friday, it was by all the members of the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of IMO, any government who was in attendance could vote. When it comes to adoption of these rules, it will only be the parties to the Annex 6, which is where these rules will sit under. And at the moment, there's 108 parties to Mark of Annex 6. And of those parties, you require a two thirds majority for them to be passed, which would essentially means a 72 working majority to get these rules passed. Now, if you think on Friday, 63 governments supported approval. I haven't done the analysis. By far, the majority of them were parties to Annex 6. So there's still a few states short. But then there were a lot of abstentions on Friday, I think about 20 abstentions from the vote. And frankly, it wouldn't take many of those states to, and I fully expect several of them to recognize that this framework is one they can work within in terms of achieving the net zero goal and therefore would support them come October. So that's the first rule next stage. For industry itself, obviously, that then will help provide, again, the signal and certainty that we're looking for, which I've already alluded to, to move forward in terms of investment decisions. And again, this is why I say people are having to sit down now and really understand the implications, because they're going to have to work out a strategy, frankly. If you're a ship owner, you're going to look at your fuel strategy. If you're a fuel supplier, you're going to, it may now enable you to sort of go forward with investments to fuel production. So all these things are over the next few months will come to fruition and we'll see greater clarity. But I think at this stage, people are still just getting over the fact that we've made this great movement forward. Yeah. And thanks a lot. Obviously, like the regulation, it's also involved like two standards of greenhouse gas emission intensity at any given year. Just wondering whether this is also going to make the fuel procurement strategy more difficult, because you don't really know like when can you have achieved the lowest complying cost at any given time. You need to take your precision on any fuel. No, you're right. It's a very good question. And I think this is, frankly, that we're going to move into an age where we're probably going to have to employ fuel managers and strategists to enable sort of understanding. But I think initially, to be frank, we don't have particularly the zero net zero fuels in great supply scale globally. And so for many, it's going to be a case of dealing with the fuels we have today, working with those to achieve optimal compliance. And the reality is there will be costs involved, increased costs, because many ships and many will not necessarily be able to achieve compliance. However, one option, and certainly in the shorter term, is for if you have a ship owner and you have several ships, is for maybe have a ship that's gone beyond compliance, beyond the direct compliance threshold. You can accrue surplus units, which is what the mechanism enables you to do. There's this flexible compliance within it. And those surplus units can be then shared with other ships within your fleet. Or you can take a strategy where you can have a ship that even goes beyond that. But this is to be seen. And so we know that may be one option for companies, particularly if, as I said, they have more than one fleet. There may be pooling as well. That will be happening. That's, again, permitted under the rules whereby ships will share their compliance options. Thanks. It's just great to have you with us today. I'm just sharing the insights from the bunker industry. And this is obviously quite a landmark piece. And we will watch out for how the shipping and bunker industries are going to react. Now we hear from Georgios Kasimatis, the Director of Regulatory Affairs at DNV Maritime, which is a ship classification society, who gives us some more details on some of the regulations that were agreed at the recent meeting. Hello, Georgios. Welcome to Energy Evolution. Thank you very much for joining us today. So obviously, you know, we've had some really big news for the shipping sector. But some of these regulations agreed by the IMO look like extremely complex. So I just wanted your views on that. Thank you for having me here. So I understand that this is a question that people wonder about. And I guess we will go into the details of what we call the net zero framework. So we might as well start with discussing some of the basics of the new measures. We have, as you mentioned, the carbon intensity in the core of a combined technical measure, the GFI, as we call it, which is also linked with an economic measure. So GFI stands for greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel. That's GFI for short. And the GFI gives us a metric for evaluating the intensity of the carbon emission, the carbon footprint, if you want, of the energy used on the ship. But of course, we can foresee that there will be some complexity with respect to operations, with respect to, let's say, administrative procedures, and also the economic complexities around ensuring compliance with the net zero framework requirements. On the other hand, I can also say that the concept itself is fairly simple, perhaps the most straightforward to implement for governments. So it is simpler for governments, perhaps, because it enforces penalties against failing to reach a certain performance, as opposed to imposing a tax on every ton of CO2 produced. That would be the case for the other alternatives that many had anticipated, the levy, as we call it, the flat levy mechanism. And it also creates a more, how can I say, a more straightforward, a simpler, perhaps, signal for investing into new fuels, zero or near zero emission fuels, as we call them, the ZZs. So these are also things we must bear in mind when we think about complexities around the new requirements. But of course, the picture gets more nuanced once we start looking into the details of implementation. How do you think a shipping company should comply with? Because obviously, as you mentioned, there is a high level of complexity involved. There are different sets of greenhouse gas emission standards for marine fuels at any given year. And what's your suggestion for a shipping company? Looking closer into the regulation, understanding which technology fits your compliance strategy best is important. And also bringing the competence of the company up to speed with both technical and operational needs. The administrative and commercial realities related to the GFI, securing enough fuel that is low emission or zero and near zero emission technologies. All these things are important to have under control. Once this is under control, the GFI is designed to make it easier for ships to comply. And there are two elements that help, let's say, the GFI requirement to do this. Namely, there is a two-tier compliance approach and also a built-in flexibility in the requirement itself. Yes, indeed. And especially, I think you just mentioned a keyword, two tiers. So obviously, a ship owner can have a very strong ambition, just go directly to zero emission fuel. You can have lower ambition or you can have no ambition at all and pay a hefty fine. But I mean, it's obviously like, do you think it's actually creating a quite interesting but also complicated fuel procurement environment? Because you can obviously be aware that there are so many potential options there for a ship owner. So the GFI has two tiers of compliance and this is also something that is different from the fuel EU. And then the annual greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel used by the ship is required to meet a base target and a direct target. So the direct compliance target is more stringent than the base one. And we keep in mind that the higher the attained GFI, the worse it is for the ship. So the base target is below the reference line of 2008 and the direct target is even lower. So the lower the GFI, the better. Now, all ships must meet with the direct target, the most stringent target. But there is a difference in how, let's say, the deficits are handled depending on which tier the annual GFI of the ship lies in. So if the annual attained GFI is below the direct target, then the ship over complies. And then, as you said, if we have access to low carbon fuels, then surplus units are generated, or as we call them, SU. If the annual GFI is above targets, but below the base, then the ship has tier one deficits. And then we need to buy what we call remedial units or RUs. And if the GFI of the ship is above base as well, then the ship has a compliance deficit in both tiers. And it has to buy remedial units for both tier one and tier two, or trade with surplus units, as we call them, from over-compliant ships. And it's important to note that the tier one and tier two remedial unit prices are different. So tier one is lower, it's about, or not about, it's at $100 per ton of CO2 equivalent, while the RU for tier two is much higher at $380 per ton of CO2. So you see that then we have different compliance options. And of course, for some, it might be easier to have access to low carbon fuels, but for others, it will be harder. So if you have access to low emission fuels and can go below direct, then you might as well go for it and trade it after, trade the over-compliance as surplus units, or ban those surplus units for using at a later point where the emission reduction requirement will be stricter.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-15\n==================================================\n\n### A dose of realism for Europe’s CBAM\n**Episode ID:** 5076\n**Transcribed:** 2025-08-04 22:59:39.985835\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello and welcome to Energy Evolution, the S&P Global Commodity Insights podcast dedicated to covering the fascinating and ever-changing world of the energy transition. I'm your host, Eklavya Gupte, and in this episode, we will try our best to dissect the proposed changes to the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, or CBAM. We will examine and explore what the tweaked version of CBAM means for global trade. Firstly, for those who don't know much about CBAM, this mechanism essentially imposes a carbon tariff on emission-intensive commodities imported by the EU, including aluminium, cement, electricity, fertilizers, hydrogen, and iron and steel. And the aim is to level the playing field for EU industry by reducing carbon leakage, as most exporting countries do not have a carbon price, especially a price as high as the one in the EU emissions trading system. This carbon border tax is currently in its transitional phase where importers must report emissions embedded in relevant products, but there is no financial penalty. However, CBAM will enter its definitive phase on January 1st, 2026, with bigger implications for many industries. But as we know, the European industry is mired in an affordability and competitiveness crisis, with several EU member states increasingly focused on industrial survival rather than decarbonization, and Brussels has had to pivot and make some changes. The Commission has proposed to tweak the timeline for the sale of carbon pricing certificates under CBAM and move to a mass-based threshold to make this more streamlined and effective. Brussels says these changes eliminate CBAM obligations for almost 90% of total importers, while still covering almost 99% of emissions in scope. So we have several guests today to delve into the nitty-gritty of these proposed changes. To start off, we spoke with Coralie Lorenzon, Senior Director in the Power and Climate Policy Team at S&P Global Commodity Insights. Welcome Coralie to Energy Evolution. Thank you so much for joining us. So to start off, Coralie, can you please give us some insight into what were some of the big changes, the big reasons behind the changes to CBAM, and do you think they can actually make a big difference? Yeah, so thanks, Aklavya. I'm delighted to be here and it's a really topical topic, right? There's a lot of discussion around CBAM. It's an important topic for Europe at the moment. So what happened recently was that the European Commission set out some proposals to simplify CBAM, really simplify as much as possible. And it's important to keep in mind these are proposals, so this needs to be validated by the Council, European Parliament. My view is that it'll be quite simple. We shouldn't expect hardly any pushback, so I would expect most of this to go through as it is. The idea here for the Commission is that it's heard what stakeholders have been saying, which is that this is a really complex instrument. This is a really cumbersome instrument. This is a really, this requires a lot of effort and manpower to comply with. And so what can the EU do? And the EU has replied and it said, well, we can simplify and we can do it with several measures. We can make sure that there are fewer importers that need to comply with CBAM. We can change how default values are calculated so that it's more fair, more respectful of what people actually are emitting. We can give a little bit of leeway about how many certificates you need to have every quarter. So, you know, a little bit of breathing space. And then the main measure was that there's a delay for the first year only in the handing in of the certificates. So you don't need to hand in certificates until end of 2027 for emissions in 2026. So all of that just gives a little bit of breathing room to the importers. But more importantly, what it's done specifically with the change of the threshold is that it has said, well, a huge amount of people who were in CBAM are now no longer in CBAM. So there are much fewer importers that are going to have to deal with this process. So that's the main thing. Thank you. And generally, what has been the response from the solar industry? So the response has been really positive. Industry is welcoming these changes. What they're also saying is that there's more that they'd like to see from the EU. So this is, you know, industry thinks this is a first step. But of course, industry very pleased with the proposal. And you mentioned some of those changes. And, you know, we've heard that they want to sort of add a scope of downstream products. There's various others. So can you give us some insight into some of the changes that we might see? And what do you really expect? What more changes do we expect on CBAM? So this is really the interesting bit. We think that the CBAM is unfinished business. You know, it's a first of a kind policy. It's very novel. No one has done this before. So it really is learning by doing for the EU and unfortunately for stakeholders in this. We expect to see more changes in the coming year. What I find personally striking is that the EU is now considering measures that were completely inconceivable two, three years ago, when this was first accepted and discussed. And you were saying export rebates, for example, the inclusion of downstream products. So all of what industry has been saying are loopholes in the system, the fact that if you pay a carbon cost in Europe, but you export your product to geography where there is no carbon cost, then you're at a disadvantage. So that's what export rebates are meant to solve. And then there's the whole issue of downstream products, which is, well, that's fine. If I import steel, then there is a carbon cost that needs to be associated. But what if I import a product that is made with steel, but not in the list of CBAM products? So all of these discussions are now happening. The EU, you can tell, is listening, is trying to figure out if it can do it and if it makes sense, right? Because it needs to make sense. There needs to be enough of a cost differential for it to introduce this measure to wider products. Thank you. And you mentioned some of these changes. And it does also sound like the Commission is almost becoming a bit more protectionist or CBAM itself is becoming a bit more of a protectionist policy. Would you say that's the case? And especially in the wider context of all these tariffs we're seeing and some of the geopolitical tensions, especially to do with trade? So first of all, I fully agree. That's absolutely the point. The European Union is trying to make CBAM easier to deal with, but it is not weakening CBAM. And I think exactly as you've said, quite the reverse, trying to make CBAM more airtight, more solid, more protective of EU industry. And it's exactly what you were saying. It's a difficult time for Europe. There are global tensions, global political tensions, there are trade tensions. There's a war in Europe, war in the Middle East. There's overall less appetite for a collaborative global effort to solve climate change. And Europe is finding that it's set the bar very high for itself. And the rest of the world is thinking about other things, right? So it's having to think about where does it go from here. And especially because growth in Europe is weak, European industry is not doing well. And as you were saying, it's coming under a lot of competition from countries which may have access to cheaper energy, or where the investment frameworks are more supportive. And of course, Europe feels and industry feels we need to be in a strong place to deliver this energy transition. This is not where Europe is. So if it is going to go forward with aggressive carbon pricing, and remain the premium carbon market for the world, then it needs to be very mindful of how that impacts industry. Okay, no, thank you. Very interesting. So is it fair to say we sort of expect more tweaks, really, of EU industrial and climate policy? Or is it more of a sort of intersection between those two? I think that's the big question. We are starting to see signs, more or less subtle, that Europe may have to rethink some of what it's already agreed and take a hard look at where it wants to go. And let me detail that a little bit. If you look at what member states have been saying, what industry is saying, there are some questions that on the usefulness or the validity or the appropriateness of certain of the fit for 55 package of measures, right? So there are discussions about can the car industry meet the emissions target that it has? There are questions about have the rules for the definition of renewable hydrogen been set appropriately? How do we get to low carbon heat? Because really banning boilers, which the EU several EU countries have tried to do, has not been successful. So you know, there are little bits of tension and various pieces of regulation. And we think that the EU is going to take a hard look at that, or we think that member states will push the EU to take a hard look at that. And the big question is, what does that mean for the carbon market, right? Because the CBAM is the flip side or the other side of the coin of the carbon market. Where is that going to go for Europe? Yeah, and that sort of segues well into my next question, which is, you know, what does this sort of simplification mean for the EU emissions trading system as obviously CBAM was linked with the phasing out of free allowances? And yeah, just be interested to find your thoughts on that. And also maybe an outlook on EU carbon prices. Yeah. So carbon prices in Europe, since the start of the war in Ukraine, have stopped their purely upside trajectory, right? So prices are much more range bound, and the range is quite large, somewhere between 60 and 80, depending on where we are. But it's really hard to see now that prices will surge in the way that there was some expectations they would. We still view that prices will rise out to 2030 and beyond. And that's because we have the assumption that the ETS will stay as it is with a declining cap with more pressure on industry. So our view is that we see 100 euros per tonne in 2030, which two or three years ago, you would have said, well, that's incredibly conservative. And today, you might think, oh, that's actually quite that's a large price for industry. That's something that industry will struggle to deal with, especially in this hyper competitive environment. And I think we're at a place in the European discussion where a very small window is opening for a very hard nosed discussion about the future of the ETS. And how much can European industry take? Because you could argue that the ETS has done its job for power. Power in Europe is largely decarbonized. We've got 50% renewables, roughly, and 70% low carbon, if you include nuclear. And you can see that renewables addition will continue, you can see that the power is on route for a very well decarbonized power mix. So the question is, what do we do with industry? And the ETS's trajectory has always been, well, we are going to bring industry in the abatement story, we're going to increase, or sorry, lower the cap, we're going to make industry reduce its emissions, and that's going to push the price up. And that increasing price signal will push industry to reduce its emissions or to make investments to reduce its emissions further. But now we're in a place where Europe is starting to ask itself, can industry carry that cost at a time when it needs to beef itself up to compete globally? And there are voices saying, should the ETS be softened? Do we need to think about what is the appropriate range of prices? And how do we get there? And what we're seeing is that these are very early stage discussions. But in the economic context, where we are in the global trade context, where we are, it makes a lot of sense. And the team that I am in, we're starting to explore what would a softer ETS scenario look like? How could that play out? What would it deliver? How would it impact industry and power? So that's really interesting. I think, you know, we're at a time where, which is unlike any other in the history of the ETS, really. And I guess one question I wanted to say was, one of the big purposes of CBAM was to A-level the playing field, but also to incentivize other countries and regions to adopt carbon pricing, adopt their own CBAM. And I know we've seen some of these changes, but is that objective still the case? And what are we seeing globally that might help CBAM or might help carbon pricing? So we're definitely, I think CBAM in that respect is a success. It has pushed the adoption of carbon markets globally. There are many countries that are thinking about introducing carbon pricing. So around the EU, I think Turkey is one of the best examples. It has set a net zero target for after 2050. But nevertheless, it's got ambition to cut emissions in steel. It's thinking about the design of its ETS. And all of that is very much ETS driven. And then obviously, the UK is a good example as well. It has a carbon market, it's very similar to the EU market. But it's thinking, you know, should we be joining the EU, at least from a carbon perspective, and at least rejoining the EU ETS. India's thinking about a carbon market and has put objectives to decarbonize steel. And we're seeing investment in Indian steel, right? We're seeing companies looking at electric arc furnaces and steel looking at CCS. So definitely it is having an impact. And that is that is a win for Europe, because one of the ways that Europe wanted to frame CBAM was to say, well, everyone is slowly coming to this idea that carbon pricing is essential. And we're going to introduce the CBAM until everyone has introduced carbon pricing, it'll be a transitional mechanism, but it will push countries along and it will get us all to the place where we need to be in 2050. That kind of thinking where everyone is aiming for the same place in 2050 is no longer seems to be a global priority. But the threat of the flows of money definitely have focused the mind and we are seeing carbon instruments being rolled out much more thanks to, you know, CBAM. Thank you very much for your time, Coralie. Really appreciate you coming to speak with us on the podcast. And now we move to the second segment. And here we're lucky to be joined by two experts, who I would say have been living and breathing CBAM these last few years. And I've been very much involved in the real details around this highly complex, high stakes world of carbon taxes and emissions accounting. We have Dan Malesky from Redshaw Advisors, who is leading the consultancy's EU CBAM research team, and has been working with industrials, governments and various other stakeholders on this issue. And we're also lucky to have Nick Ogilvie, product manager at Carbon Chain, which specializes in the complicated world of carbon accounting, and has tailor made solutions targeting the commodity markets. Firstly, welcome both. Pleasure to have you here. And thank you for joining us in our London studio. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So to start off, obviously, the Commission has made quite a few changes to reduce the impact of CBAM on small importers. But there are still a lot of uncertainties with regards to CBAM. So maybe to start off with, can you highlight some of these uncertainties? And how are the importers of these goods and the various stakeholders handling these uncertainties? Yeah, sure. Happy to start. So I think the sigh of relief for many of the impacted businesses on CBAM has been around the focus on simplification. The key change has been the threshold increase to 50 tonnes, which is tonnes of material or 100 tonnes of CO2 being imported on an annual basis per entity. Now, as you mentioned, this reduces the number of entities in the EU who now have to continue to do their CBAM reporting, quite significantly removing around an estimated 180,000 entities in the EU from that obligation. This will align with the Omnibus changes, the objectives behind Omnibus around simplification of the reduction of the administrative burden for these EU entities. But as you mentioned, there are still some key uncertainties that remain in place, particularly as we move towards the definitive period where really the key focus is on how much is this all going to cost us. And so whilst the reporting burden is reduced, there still remain a number of pieces that are unknown with regards to the CBAM cost. Dan, I don't know if you want to talk a bit about a few of those. Yeah, yeah. Well, firstly, very well said, Nick. And just to point out, the CBAM has always been intended to change as it evolves. I like to say that the CBAM is almost building the plane in flight. And it has to be designed that way. If we take a step back, a policy like this has never been really introduced. There isn't truly a precedent. There has been some theoretical ideas. I mean, if I look at what California potentially looked at when they incorporated a BCA for their power sector, but no one's ever done this. So it's very much understandable that the EU is having an approach of trying to almost have training wheels for itself, as well as industry. But the result of that, of course, is a lack of certainty. And that is one of the main Achilles heels of this policy. If I look at some of the main changes that will likely take place to the CBAM, and not even the coming years, but the coming months, looking at things such as export leakage protection measures, potentially expanding CBAM both to downstream emissions and to new sectors, and a plethora of more changes. And so as much as these changes can be very difficult to navigate, they are required if we want to ensure that this policy stays robust and accomplishes the goals it's set out to be, which is to mitigate carbon leakage. I think one of the big kind of takeaways that people may be interpreting incorrectly is that CBAM has the cost has been delayed, which is not correct. So whilst the payment structure under Omnibus has been shifted, where certificates can now purchase in 2027, the fundamental implementation of a CBAM cost on CBAM goods being imported into the EU still takes place from the 1st of January 2026. So if you are an entity who is importing these goods and you intend to release them for free circulation, and you expect to import above 50 tons in the year, you need to be accruing for your CBAM costs. And something that I think we're going to get into a lot more detail is what are you accruing for? So what is the actual CBAM certificate cost that you are exposed to from the 1st of January 2026? And, you know, you said, obviously, now you only have to purchase CBAM certificates from February 2027. So there's a bit of breathing room. But how are companies having to change their strategy? Or have they had to change their hedging strategy, for instance, or not? And what's the sort of main reason for that sort of 13 month grace period, so to speak? So my clients have not changed their hedging strategies at all. Let's take an example of let's say I'm a steel trader. Let's say I want to sell my steel and import steel from let's say, February 2026. So if I'm looking at how steel typically is traded, that means that contract could be signed in, let's say, August or even July of 2025. So we're talking only a few months. So we're talking maybe four or five, six months until custom clearance, but nevertheless, they will still incur a cost of carbon, it might not be realized until 2027. But it's still being incurred. So actually, the issue is that some folks can perceive this as breathing room, even though realistically, if you look at the financial incursion, nothing changes. Therefore, the folks that we work with, at least, we have to really ensure that they are aware that actually, nothing really changes when it comes to the financial incursion. It's simply when that cost is realized, i.e. cash flow. And so that's one of the issues we're having is actually a perception of what's going on. And there's sort of two variables in CBAM cost. There is the EUA price, which will dictate the CBAM certificate price, and that'll be on a quarterly average basis in 2026. And so, as Dan says, you can establish with the help of good partners, an effective EUA hedging strategy to cover your CBAM certificate costs. But what you don't necessarily know is the other variable, which is on the product emissions intensity. So the way that CBAM certificates are calculated is relative to a CBAM benchmark, another unknown that we expect to hear about in the coming months from the commission. But specifically, you have a carbon intensity of the product that you're importing, you compare that to the benchmark figure, which will be an intensity figure. And then if you're above the benchmark, you have to purchase certificates. If you're below the benchmark, you will not have to purchase any certificates in the same way that there is free allocation under the ETS with regards to the purchase of EUAs. So we're mimicking the ETS system for costing. So with the emissions intensity figure, one of the other challenges is that today, you will not know what that emissions intensity figure will be in 2026. Because the number that you need to use in order to assess your certificate cost is the verified figure based on the calendar year 2026 calculation of that product's emissions intensity, which must be received from the supplier and must be verified in order for it to be used in if you use that number instead of a default value in order to calculate your certificate exposure in 2027 for those 2026 imports. And this brings up a number of challenges for importers because effectively, there is an unknown cost with regards to exactly what that figure will be. However, we will have a default value that unlike in the transitional period where there is what has been a requirement for actual data since July 2024, we will have default values to be used for this cost calculation in 2026. Whether or not you want to use those numbers as a result of the fact that they will be defined to be punitive in the sense that we based either off available data from the country of origin or the 10 worst countries and emissions intensity basis for that specific product. Thank you. And obviously, this creates a lot of uncertainty on costs. So how are traders and manufacturers dealing with this? And how are they changing their strategy? Yeah, it's a very good question. And when it comes to the relationships we've had with traders, the main motif is that they are not a fan of speculation at all. And so as Nick mentioned with all these variables, benchmark default values verification, it's something that traders are not a fan of. And so if I'm a trader, if my entire business model is to lock in a margin by hedging all my variable costs, when I get that contract, I can't hedge or manage that CBAM costs. Well, what do I do? They have a few very limited options and very expensive options at that we worked with some traders to incorporate various option contracts, because again, if the main one of the main variables that they can look at is EUA price, well, maybe they can try and take tackle that. So we can incorporate, for example, some type of option contracts, but that incurs a premium. And again, this potentially can even further erode the profit margins that they still can't even predict because of all this. And so the result of this are traders being very, very frustrated, and I don't blame them. I mentioned earlier that the CBAM is supposed to change, and it's supposed to change to benefit the policy. But if this policy is keep changing, and there's a lot of unknowns, how are people supposed to navigate this, especially when you look at the different types of business models, because an industrial manufacturer and a trader will all interact with this policy different, they'll pass the cost on differently, they can even incorporate different contracts differently. And so the result of that environment that continually changes with this policy is a lot of frustration. And that really is the main emotion that I feel when I'm speaking with my clients who are traders. What are your learnings from some of your sources and clients on this? And are there particular sectors that are coping better with CBAM or are better placed? So just be good to get a wider perspective on how things are currently working. And as the commission, listen to some of the feedback. Yeah, I mean, from from my perspective, if I take, let's take a very simple example of cement. So when you make cement, it's fairly integrated. When you trade cement isn't typically traded more than a 500 kilometre radius. And so if I'm Europe, I'm typically dealing with the same players, unlike steel or aluminium, which is very much global. And especially if I point out steel and aluminium, cement is typically traded when it comes to fairly upstream products, clinker, for example. But steel, that's almost everything. Of course, you're going to see a lot of trade volumes in more upstream products, but they will still trade products that can be further downstream. And so that creates a few challenges. First of all, it creates circumvention, which the commission is very much aware about. But that is still very much a concern for our clients. It also creates a significant more amount of complexity, especially if you actually look at the precursors in how steel can be traded. This is more Nick's neck of the woods. But if I just take my conversations from my cement versus aluminium clients, it really is two kinds of perspectives on this that are quite significantly varied. Yeah, the steel aluminium complexity is certainly yeah, hindered by the fact that there are many intermediaries and there are different processes that these steel products get to market. I think one of the areas that will continue to be an ongoing challenge is where you have distributors, stockholders of these materials, where actually in the same lot, they are combining material from many different mills under the same from different production processes, which have different emissions benchmarks, different emissions intensities. And so the ability for those players to accurately track and then be able to accurately price the CBAM cost is something that will make a significant commercial difference to the viability of a number of these these businesses. So yeah, steel and aluminium certainly continues to be tricky, hopefully with some of the omnibus changes. And when we get an understanding of what the modifications look like around downstream processing, the requirements for verification of simply just allocating precursors to finish good submissions, that will hopefully give more transparency to cost fundamentally, but also to the operational requirements for these businesses to continue to operate on the thin margins that they do. And that's one thing that did surprise me is and you said it right there, a lot of these a lot of our clients do operate in fairly thin margins. And so when you incorporate uncertainty, when you incorporate new risks, when you're already looking at a fairly competitive landscape, it creates a lot of headaches, a lot of issues, a lot of questions of is this market still worth it? Now, it's something that if you really analyze, this is something that could significantly disrupt trade. If I'm looking at export destination markets, and I'm looking at, let's say going to the EU, and there's a significant amount of barriers to even enter that market, it creates very inefficient trade patterns. And that's one of the main things any economist would say about trade is you don't want barriers, barriers create tension, tension creates inefficiency. And that is something that the EU could risk with all these hoops to jump through to even make it to market. And it's again, another one of the many headaches that a lot of our clients are dealing with. It's not just CBAM, it's EUDR, it's the acronym soup. And it's something that they're very concerned about. Maybe just quickly on the positive side as well. I think, you know, our business is focused on carbon accounting, providing the most accurate emissions data that we can to facilitate decarbonization decisions. And CBAM, in many cases has been the first time that businesses have ever done carbon accounting. And generally, you start with carbon accounting through a spend based method, or you look to use a global or a country average emissions factor for the material that you're trading, or producing. And all of a sudden, CBAM is mandating that you have asset specific emissions factors at the product level in many cases, which is some of the most granular carbon emissions data, if not the most granular carbon emissions data that you can have. And so we've seen many businesses with their corporate kind of net zero objectives, look at CBAM as this incredible opportunity for them to translate getting better carbon data into an actual, a really valuable commercial incentive and improvement for their business. So many of the net zero objectives that businesses had and set in the late 2010s, and some cases early 2020s, CBAM coming into effect with 2026, really trying to have actual data, so they're aware of what's going in, what their costs are going to be going into the definitive period, that they've shortened the timelines to getting actual emissions intensity information from their suppliers to facilitate some of those low carbon decisions. So having that carbon price, and a not insignificant carbon price straight off the bat in 2026, is really exciting to see this carbon cost feeding into procurement leader decisions, and then product development decisions. And I think that is, so I moved to Europe from America, because I believe in a very simple saying, which is capitalism got us into this mess, we need to leverage capitalism to get us out of this mess, i.e. capitalism, industrial revolution, create a climate change. But if we leverage capitalism, a market based approach, the EU, ETS, and CBAM, in this case, we can get us out of these issues by leveraging the behavior incentives that a cost incurs. So if I'm looking at the carrot versus stick approach on how I can incentivize behavior, when it comes to climate change, let's say the carrot is the IRA, that's the US subsidizing, trying to incentivize decisions that way. But Europe's taken the stick approach, which is a cost of carbon, and it's created some brilliant results. The EU, ETS, as a result of the EU ETS, EU ETS exposed industrials and utilities have reduced their emissions by 50% since 2005. Now, that's been because they've been forced to do this. Now, it's not just paying for emissions, it's also measuring them. And the saying goes, you can't manage what you can't measure. And so I completely agree with Nick, this is forcing companies to get into that mindset of, yeah, this is going to matter. It's not trivial. This is no longer something I can disregard. And I can maybe market a bit, but I can't really have action. This is forcing them to take action. And that's why I think it's brilliant. And that's why I'm a big believer of the CBAM when it comes to its final goal, but it's going to be very painful. decarbonization will be very difficult for a lot of companies, unless if you look at the bell curve, unless you're an early adopter of these solutions and technologies, unless you're trying to look ahead. Because if you're just twiddling your thumbs, and you're not really taking the CBAM seriously, or the EU ETS seriously, or these costs of carbon, those are the folks to get a hit out of left field in 2026, with some very significant costs. Thank you. No, that's really good to find out some of those, you know, positive impacts, really, from this policy. But you know, and as you and you all have mentioned some of the uncertainty, but we live in a world currently where geopolitics is pretty much dominating every market, US tariffs, there's a US tariff announcement every other day. And maybe the world or policy is becoming more protectionist. So I guess the question is, how does CBAM fit into this? And are we going to see, we're already seeing more CBAMs propping up, but how do you see this sort of moving forward, really, from a policy perspective? Well, the landscape we're in is, I'm going to quote Mark Twain says, history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. If you look at the 1930s, with this early tariff act, the global geopolitical landscape is somewhat copying that very much protectionist, very much isolationist, to an extent in global trade does slow down. It's not just the CBAM. It's again, it's mainly the positioning that a lot of the superpowers are taking, and to an extent, them disregarding the WTO. And so CBAM is not necessarily adding fuel to the fire. But it does fit into the global positioning of a lot of countries, which is to incorporate border adjustments. Now, the CBAM is not a protectionist policy. It's there to manage mitigate carbon leakage, but it's in a realm that's surrounded by countries that have protectionist policies. So the issue of that, though, is countries are going to start seeing CBAM as protectionist policy. So it doesn't matter if the EU Commission has an agenda to mitigate carbon leakage via the CBAM, really, it matters of what what's the eye of the beholder of who's responding to it. Because if I'm America, and if I look at the CBAM, and I say that is a protectionist policy, I shall respond as such. Now, that is an issue. Because again, it's not how CBAM is designed to be, but it is potentially how it's being interpreted. I guess, you know, depending on the way you view the CBAM, the ultimate goal is that really, that there is no CBAM in the sense that there's no cost adjustment. And what we'll see is, and as you mentioned, we're already seeing this, there are growing emissions trading systems being developed around the world with key trading partners with the EU, because they're acknowledging the fact that if they don't do that, then those goods going to the EU, the revenue will be collected by the EU through the carbon border adjustment mechanism, versus them establishing emissions trading system domestically and collecting those revenues through that system. It will also then trigger their realisation that they also need to potentially look at managing their own carbon leakage risk. And you then see more and more CBAMs appearing as a result. The next one will be the UK CBAM, depending on the UK EU discussions this spring summer about the UTS linkages. But really, I mean, it kind of boils down to the fact that we as businesses moving these carbon intensive goods around the world. Today, the matrix looks across variables like price, availability, quality, and then the logistics component. And really, carbon is just going to become another factor within that matrix. And so when we think about where our business is going, and how we're really supporting clients, it's really focused around carbon insights, and being able to enable you to understand that if you're moving goods from two different countries, these are the costs that you're looking at specifically on the carbon intensity side. And then here's how you can look to manage that based on the availability of material at a certain carbon intensity, where you're optimising ultimately around those benchmark intensity figures that will continue to decrease as we as a world look to hit our net zero objectives. If I could add, when I speak with people about CBAM, and if we take the perspective that this is for a course for carbon leakage, which it is, but at the same time, there's also a bit of dilution of what that actually means. So let's take the example of the US automotive industry that has, to an extent, left widely the US to other countries, for one simple reason, which is it's cheaper to do so, because America at that time was an asymmetrical landscape, higher wages, higher variable costs. And so that's exactly what happened in Europe. If I'm making cement and steel, it's just more expensive, in this case, because of CBAM, or sorry, cost of carbon, therefore I offshore. And so offshoring doesn't take place because of cost of carbon, offshoring takes place because it's just more expensive to do business in that jurisdiction. Now, the issue with countries responding to the CBAM with a cost of carbon is they might be reluctant to incorporate that high of a cost of carbon. If I look at a lot of ETSs in the world, I believe there's 38 of them, most of them have a very soft cost of carbon. What does that mean? So it's not actually the dollar amount, what that cost is trading at, it's the underlying structure of that market. EU ETS is an absolute cap, a lot of markets have a relative cap. EU ETS has phased out free allocation quite significantly, no other jurisdiction, well, most jurisdictions have not done that. So not only are they have a softer cost of carbon, but those costs are getting watered down via free allocation, as well as we're not covering the same emissions. Because at the end of the day, a country doesn't want to incur significant costs if that is their USP. If I'm an exporting country, and I'm industrial reliant, my entire USP is either being able to produce something at a significantly lower cost, or being able to produce a lot of it and potentially flooding it by dumping. And so if I incorporate that cost of carbon, if I'm China, if I actually incorporate a cost of carbon that's equal to my European counterpart, and that's taking a break in my economy. And so they're going to be looking at this question, not from a climate change perspective, rather from a fiscal responsibility, should I shoot my USP in the foot? Now, of course, this creates innovation, right? If you create a challenge, a problem, you can hopefully find a reason to solve that. But as a result of this, though, I might be hesitant to look at every country responding to CBIM with an ETS as the same. They're not all apples and apples and apples. A lot of them is apples and oranges, if you look at how these ETSs are structured. But that's those are the conversations we're having with governments and our clients. And that's what their concerns are, especially lately. Thank you both. It'd be interesting to see how carbon pricing mechanisms have to evolve, especially with more turbulence in geopolitics and in global trade. In the next few years, we will keep an eye on this topic at S&P Global Commodity Insights. The Energy Evolution podcast is hosted by me and Taylor Kirkendall. And I would like to give special thanks to our wonderful podcast team members, Camilla Nashut, Dan Testa, Christopher Coates and Karen Villenbrite.

I'm your host, Taylor Kirkendall, and in this episode, we're unpacking a significant development in U.S. mineral production policy that could reshape the landscape of domestic resource management. See, critical minerals are essential to the energy transition because they serve as the foundational components for this wide range of technologies that drive renewable energy and energy efficiency. See, minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements, they're all vital for the production of batteries, which power electric vehicles, and things that store renewable energy resources, but also used in the kind of equipment that we use for solar energy and wind energy. Now, back on March 20th, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that was aimed at ramping up domestic mineral production through the Defense Production Act. Now, this move is part of a broader strategy that aims to reduce America's reliance on foreign mineral supplies, particularly from China, which has long dominated the mining and refining sectors for critical minerals. Now, we have several great guests today to talk about this order. We're going to hear from Francesca Price, a senior analyst in the Metals and Mining Research Team here at S&P Global Commodity Insights. We'll also hear from executives from two mining companies that are working on U.S. projects. We have Mark Smith, Executive Chairman and President and CEO of Nio Quilt Developments. They're building the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project, which is North America's only niobium-scandium-titanium project, and that's going to be located in Nebraska. We also have Pat Reisner, President of SAP32 Marbosa, the only advanced mining project in the United States that could produce two federally-designated critical minerals, that's manganese and zinc. The mine is the first to use this expedited permitting system that we're going to hear more about soon called FAST-41. Finally, we'll hear about some of the environmental concerns about all this mining from Ethan Manuel. He's the Director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program, which works on issues related to public lands, forests, wilderness and wildlife issues. Let's kick off the episode with Francesca Price, Mining Insights, for a breakdown of why the U.S. is taking this action. When we talk about overseas reliance on critical minerals, we're looking at an average of about 50% for the U.S., but that varies massively between commodities and it also depends at what stage of the supply chain we're looking at. So if we take zinc, for example, so the U.S. is a net exporter of mine zinc, so the material that's actually coming out the ground, but because it's got no domestic refining capacity, it's exporting all of that material and then it's completely reliant on the imports of the refined product. This pattern's observed for many commodities, really, and it's not just limited to the U.S. either. So obviously, having the raw material in the ground and the right conditions to extract it is one thing, but if you don't have the midstream capacity to actually refine it and process it into the usable form, then you're still dependent on the countries which do, which is where China has done so well, really, in building out its kind of integrated supply chains. If we think of the projects that maybe exist but haven't been brought online already, or yeah, you refer to the materials are in such high demand, why aren't they online? So there's several factors that come into play when we look at increasing supply and demand is really only kind of one of them and quite a small factor, really. I mean, it's often cited that supply is elastic to demand and if the demand is there, then the market will provide. And while that's true when we're looking at kind of overall trends over the decade timescale, there's so many other factors that contribute to getting a project up and running. So obviously, there's the geological and the geographical constraints to start with. There's the economic environment that we're operating in. Obviously, commodity prices fluctuate, they can be really volatile. We've got environmental concerns as infrastructure, and there's all these other permitting considerations that can take years and years to work through. And then there's kind of a secondary list of barriers to market that critical minerals specifically experience. So if we take out kind of gold and base metals from the list, for critical mineral markets, they typically suffer with kind of a trade-off between the monetary value and the strategic value of commodity, which means that the development of these projects quite often lose out to kind of the gold and the base metal projects. And it also means that the kind of the market dynamics and the supply chains for these materials are generally far more complex, far more opaque, which obviously increases the commercial risk and therefore deters investment. So there's lots of different factors at play as to why these projects aren't getting off the ground quick enough. And so this new executive order from President Trump issued on March 20th, it's trying to take an attempt at turning that thing around and getting more mining and mineral production here in the United States. Can you tell us just a little bit about a high-level overview of what that executive order does, and maybe to what degree we've seen other administrations or congressional efforts to do the same in the past? Yeah, so as you say, this executive order is fundamentally aimed at increasing domestic production of critical minerals. And that's not just the raw material out the ground, but it's also referring to the refined product and also the component and the end product. So what it's really doing is trying to build out these end-to-end supply chains. And obviously, this is all part of the effort to reduce reliance on overseas supply of minerals, but particularly from China. And there's the three main takeaways or actions from the executive order that are really important here. So the first one is identifying and fast-tracking permitting of priority mining projects. The second one is prioritizing mineral production on federal land specifically. And the third one is mobilizing existing capital and existing financing mechanisms to support these domestic projects. So that's utilizing the Development Finance Corporation and also the Export-Import Bank. And this approach isn't radical. Most countries are trying to do the same thing here in one way or another. We're trying to secure critical mineral supply chains. So the EU, for example, they have literally just a couple of days ago released their strategic project list. And that kind of shares a lot of the sentiment behind President Trump's priority project list, which is the expedited permitting. But kind of closer to home in the US, we've, of course, only got to look to a few years ago with the Inflation Production Act. And that shares a lot of the same ideology really to that executive order to an extent, which was the aim to strengthen US supply chains for critical minerals and then discourage sourcing of the minerals from certain parts of the world. So we've certainly seen similar measures taken in the past, both in the US and elsewhere. But this executive order does go one step further by proposing quite drastic changes actually to things such as mining regulation and land use policy. So yeah, it's certainly going one step further than what's been done before. Yeah. So if it's one step further, do you see this having a big impact on the mining sector in the short and the long term? I mean, is this going to change how mining companies start to think about how they're going to invest in their projects? Yeah, certainly. I mean, I think in the very immediate term, I think we're likely to see a kind of a flurry of activity in terms of kind of project PR with mining companies really pushing to make sure that their projects are seen as sort of most favorable and clinching that priority project status. Over the long term, I think it's really tricky to know at this stage. I mean, obviously, this is it's an executive order. It's not legislation. And obviously, Trump's term will be up in four years time, at which point it could be revoked entirely. So it does beg the question as to kind of the long term viability of this and how much can really be achieved in that time. There's some kind of bold statements being made in that executive order. Okay. So now we've laid out some of that groundwork. Let's turn to Mark Smith. He leads NIO Corp. Developments. NIO Corp. is developed in a greenfield underground mining project in Nebraska, focused on four key product streams, niobium, scandium, titanium, and magnetic rare earth oxides. Currently, the US relies almost entirely on imports for niobium and scandium, and imports most of its titanium and its magnetic rare earth oxides. The minerals have a whole lot of applications. For example, niobium plays a role in strengthening steel for automotive and infrastructure safety. Scandium has got potential to enhance aluminum for the automotive and aerospace industries. Titanium is used in aircraft alloys, and rare earth oxides are a necessity for electric vehicles and defense technologies. I asked Mark his first reaction when he heard about the new executive orders from the Trump administration. I started cheering to begin with, because this is a recognition at the highest level of our government that we have a problem and we have to solve this problem. I think that we were very positive with the president's remarks when he said he was going to issue this executive order as well. There is a recognition that we need mining, we need mineral processing, and we need parts production. We need the whole supply chain to be located in the United States. We have not had that recognition at this level of office, as far as I know, for the 66 years that I've been alive. So this was just extremely good news. The issue of permitting is in there. The issue of financing is in there. The issue of having the whole supply chain available in-country is there. I think it's just tremendous that we're recognizing this and willing to do something about it. Yeah. So tell us a little bit more about what's in the order and maybe specifically tell us what you like most about what this order is able to accomplish. I think there's two things. One is the permitting issue. The president understands that when these mining projects, really legitimate projects operated by good companies, get into this thing that we all call permitting hell, that's going to be corrected now. We're going to have multiple eyes on these projects and we're going to make sure that reasonable decisions are made and that projects are moved forward, just not held in limbo forever. So that permitting issue, I think, comes out as very strong to me. Now, I will also say that as important as that is to the industry at NIOCorp with our project in southeast Nebraska, we actually have all the permits in hand that we need to start construction on that. So we're in a little different shape. But the second part of the order that captured my attention was the recognition for financing on these projects. So the president has provided in his executive order means and methods to get debt and equity financing through both the DFC and EXIM. And again, on NIOCorp's behalf, I would also say that we're in a very fortunate situation because we started working with EXIM about two years ago and we are well along the path of hopefully securing a loan for our project here in the near future. So these are things that we kind of understood and took care of. Other companies have not been as fortunate and the president has done a great job of opening the door to taking care of these two issues. And as the private investment industry starts to see the government investment into these projects, I think that you're going to see an opening up of the financing capabilities of these projects. It's been very difficult for many years right now. So those are the two things that I think make the biggest difference. Is there anything missing from the order that you would have liked to have seen or maybe even to take the question in a slightly different route? It is a little uncertain given that there's an executive order versus some of the finality you might have with this as an act of Congress. Can you tell me about maybe what you would like to see being improved upon, whether it's through an executive policy or whether that's through something that we see in Congress that would make it easier to mine here in the United States? It's an outstanding question. And I think my response to that is very simply that I think this is a fantastic start. And I recognize, like you just did, Taylor, that there's much more to be had here. How strong is the executive order? Will it be challenged? Do we need to go to Congress? All of those issues that are going to have to be dealt with as we move forward with this executive order. The one thing that gives me great hope is that in the many, about 10 years that we've been working on the Nile Corp project now, we're seeing support for this whole idea of critical strategic minerals and complete supply chains in the United States. We're seeing support for that across the aisle. There isn't one party or the other that supports it. It's both parties. And so I think the good news to me is that we've got some momentum started here with the executive order from President Trump. And I feel very confident that if we need to get additional congressional support and approval for this, that it will be coming because we're just seeing an across-the-board recognition that this is an issue and something that has to be addressed. I'm confident that this is a great start. It creates good momentum. And to the extent that we need additional details or additional congressional action, I think it will be there. And Mark told me during our conversation that the executive order has already spurred new interest from the investment community. Keep in mind, Mark and I talked just a few days after the executive order had come out. Yeah. And let me talk about that from a real, realistic basis. When the executive order came out Friday, my phone has been ringing off the hook for the last three days now. And I'd count four, but I was busy watching the Colorado State Rams play in the NCAA basketball tournament one day. So I didn't answer a lot of calls that day. But with that aside, because we did lose, my phone has been ringing off the hook with investment parties that are saying, what does this executive order mean? What does it do for NIO Corp? And I'm explaining it to them as thoroughly as I can. We all have a lot of questions, but people recognize that there is going to be government funding available for these projects that need to be here in the United States. Good projects, environmentally sound projects that meet the needs of our critical and strategic minerals that we are literally importing 100% of today. So just based on the three days of the phone ringing off the hook, I think that's a pretty good story all by itself. And I have phone calls the rest of this week on the same subject matter. So it has raised the awareness. Now we're out telling our story about our project constantly. So we have a lot of people that are in the know, but people immediately saw this executive order and they want to talk to us more about this project and what it means to the country. Okay. So let's hear about another project from our guest, Pat Reisner. As a reminder, he's the president of South32 Hermosa, a company that's enjoyed a fast track status for permitting its mining project in Arizona. The Hermosa project is a significant critical minerals initiative featuring one of the largest undeveloped was in deposits alongside a high purity battery grade 90s deposit. With a total investment of approximately $2.6 billion, Pat said the project is currently 40% through its construction phase and they're aiming to begin production in the first half of 2027. Let's hear Pat describe how a program known as FAST 41 makes it easier to build a mine in the United States. FAST 41 is a program that was put into place in 2015, enacted by Congress. FAST is actually an acronym that stands for Fixing America's Surface Transportation. And that's because the program was originally put in place. There was a collection of critical infrastructure projects that were shovel ready and the government wanted to deploy. And the program was to create a more coordinated, transparent, efficient way to get through the NEPA process, the National Environmental Policy Act process for federal compliance. Mining was added as a covered sector under FAST 41 a few years later, but until recently, there'd never been a mining project added to FAST 41. So Hermosa was added as the first mining project in the program in 2023, largely, I think, because of the criticality of the two supply chains for the critical minerals we produce and our reliance on foreign sources, but also to some extent, our proposing to develop the project from a sustainability standpoint and what it does for our host community. But what FAST 41 really does is it has elements to it that address a lot of the common administrative delays that we see with large, complex projects like this. You have to get into FAST 41, there's a certain investment threshold and you have to demonstrate importance or criticality in nation. And so the role of the Federal Permitting Council, which is an independent agency that has oversight of FAST 41 projects, is probably the key. They, as I said, are an independent agency. Their role is to support the lead agency to help with coordination. NEPA is a big coordination process. That's what makes it complex. That's what makes it a bit unwieldy and challenging is your coordinate between a lead agency, a lot of cooperating agencies, tribes, communities, local government, just lots of stakeholders. And so Federal Permitting Council obviously helps with coordination. They help with resourcing to make sure the lead agency is resourced properly, which is also often a challenge. My experience, having been through NEPA on other mining projects before, you often get stuck when there's big decisions that need to be made. Those are put in front of the right people and made more efficiently. It's also more transparent. So there's an end-to-end schedule for the entire process published at the start. You know, Morten, because of part of the critical minerals order that we're talking about from the Health Administration, it was about trying to speed up permitting and solving that long-held permitting issue. Whereas this FAST 41, is it a great model to look at to say, here's how we solve all the problems? Are there some things in that program even that might be able to be improved upon? Yeah, we think it's a good start. We think it's a tool that could be quite effective. We were really pleased to see it called out specifically in the critical minerals executive order because we think there's a lot about it that helps with process and administrative delays, as I mentioned. But maybe the one thing I would clarify, though, that is still required, even if you have an overlay or a structure like FAST 41 to help with the process and address those administrative delays, it does still require collective will and support from leadership within the lead agency, from the federal government, obviously from the proponent. There is kind of a collective will and support still required to shepherd through the process. And that combined with some of the aspects of FAST 41, like the permitting council's role and resourcing, that's what really gets it done. So, I do want to emphasize you still do have to have that support amongst leadership for all the parties involved to get through it. I would say the other thing that still requires some focus is while FAST 41 helps with the NEPA process proper, there are a lot of other regulatory processes that have to run concurrently with NEPA to get a decision, like Section 7 consultations under the Endangered Species Act with Fish and Wildlife Service, Section 106 consultations for National Historic Preservation Act, compliance with the tribes and state historic preservation officers. Those processes have to run their course and get to a decision before a lead agency can issue a record of decision for an NEPA process. So, they have to come along. So, I think that's one of the opportunities is making sure that the agencies and the stakeholders that run those processes are also enrolled and that they're coming along because you can get through NEPA process proper as efficiently as possible. But if those processes aren't keeping pace, then you have the potential for delays. And so, we're learning a lot about that as we go through it. We're still on track, but that's probably something that can continue to get some focus and improve upon. And now fast forwarding to this side, Executive Warren zooming in on that. Tell me a little bit, you know, the mining sector, you know, sometimes has struggled to get a lot of political support, but that seems to be changing recently. I'm wondering on this kind of, you know, this big announcement came out, what was your first reaction? Well, the first reaction is it's really great to see, you know, a renewed focus on domestic mining and establishment of domestic mining. I think many of the average citizens in our country don't understand the national security risks associated with our reliance on foreign sources for many of these critical minerals and materials that we need every day and are becoming increasingly important. So, I think recognition of that importance, recognition that we need to have a domestic mining industry upstream, not just processing and midstream and downstream, but we need to mine the materials here. You know, we think if we want to maintain American standards for worker protection and environmental protections, then it is important. We can do it the right way here. We can onshore these supply chains, eliminate or reduce that national security risk for our country and really benefit communities along the way. So, I think the focus on that, the focus on timelines and permitting, FAST-41 was good to see. I think, you know, there were a few other specific provisions in there that I think recognize a few of the hurdles and challenges that the mining industry's had over the years. So, really pleased to see the focus. And do you think this is going to be enough to be that push that the industry needs to go out there and make new investments in the mining sector? Of course, I said to someone who is out there making new investments in the mining sector already, but I just wonder if you think maybe your peers will also kind of do the same or maybe there are any, you know, further actions you wish this executive order would have taken? I do think there's going to need to be a focus on how we do value the benefits of domestic mining. Certainly, there are other parts of the world where there are challenges around competition and things like that. Other parts of our sector have struggled with financing. We're financing our project off operating cash flows, our $2.6 billion investment. So, it's off the balance sheet. You know, others have to go out and raise capital to develop these projects. The EO addressed that as well. So, I think that's good for further development. But we do need to look at how we onshore the parts of the supply chain that are our customer base. We do need to look at refining for many of these critical minerals. So, I do think it will help and I think it will go a long ways towards promoting more domestic mining. There's probably still more work to do around getting the midstream and downstream onshore in the country as well. Now, of course, with all this mining development, there's concerns about the potential environmental impacts. Ethan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's land protection program, acknowledged the need for some of the minerals that are targeted by this order and says he's also worried about the potential environmental and health impacts if we rush into this mining development too fast. We're obviously very concerned about any kind of uptick in mining, especially the way the Trump administration has talked about doing it. Mining has been a priority on our federal land since 1872. And believe it or not, we are still governed by the mining law of 1872. Ulysses S. Grant was president at that time. And so, we have a very pro-mining legal framework already when it comes to public lands. And we've seen some negative impacts of this priority placed on mining on federal lands, especially in the West, especially around water quality. That's where you've seen the most damage from mining operations where material that leaches or spills out of a mining site when it rains, not so much from malfeasance, but just from regular operations, but then pollute groundwater. And that's become a more and more intense issue as climate change has accelerated a water crisis in the West. And so, our first and foremost worry is damaging precious water resources in the West, and especially when you're looking at proposed mining around the Grand Canyon or places like that that would threaten the Colorado River and that very important water system. But then also, you just see damage to public lands when a mine operates there. These mines have gotten very huge. They're usually open pit mines that do quite a bit of damage to that ecosystem. And so, as you can imagine, when you're doing a building and digging a big hole in the ground, you're damaging the surface, you're taking down trees and damaging ecosystems that are important habitats for species and opportunities for people to recreate. So, you want to see the surface damage from mining, and then you could see some water quality damage too. So, those have historically been the two main reasons. We want to make sure we do mining right when we do some of this stuff on public lands. Yeah. So, I mean, it sounds like you said do mining right. You didn't say necessarily no mining. Tell me a little bit about what it would look like to reform that 1872 mining law. What are some of the things that need to be, I guess, in place before the US does kind of start trying to dig up more of these resources? Yeah, that's a good question because, and I do want to state this, Shareclub is not opposed to new mining on federal lands. We do understand we need some of these critical minerals because we are very invested in a clean energy economy and making that transition away from fossil fuels, and we know that means batteries, and we need some precious minerals that come from mining. So, for us, the most important thing when it comes to an individual mine, so we take most of these issues by case basis. We don't have a one size fits all policy when it comes to mining on federal lands. But the most important thing is for us now is that no mining should be done on any land considered sacred to indigenous people. And again, that kind of holds true when you look at the Grand Canyon and some proposed uranium mining there, they have a Supai and other indigenous groups in Arizona have historically opposed that because of the threat to water quality from uranium mining. And they've had that in the past. They don't want to see that in the future. So, for us, the most important thing is to make sure that indigenous sites are protected from any further mining. Same thing in Arizona around Resolution Copper, a mine that would damage natural forest lands that are important to a lot of local Apache groups in Arizona. So, job one for us is to avoid sacred sites for indigenous peoples. But number two, we need mining companies to have more responsibility for cleaning up and mitigating that they operate in. And there's almost no mitigation for that. And so, we want to see a lot more done to rehabilitate abandoned mines and abandoned mine lands and have companies themselves pay for that. Right now, historically, because we haven't had much of a regulatory framework to do that, states and the feds almost always pick up the cost for cleaning up an abandoned mine. We want companies to do that. That's the second biggest one. And the third one is making sure that there is a lot more community involvement before a mine is permitted. Again, the 1872 Mining Act doesn't really have a lot of public consultation engaged in that. Other laws can be applied to that, but we need to amend the 1872 Mining Act to engage with the public and, again, especially local indigenous groups. Yeah. And do you think that can be done? I mean, a lot of the talk about this is the long permitting lag, right? I mean, is it fair to say, is there a path forward where the mining laws can be reformed, meet the kind of requirements you just mentioned that the Sierra Club would like to see, but also get these permits out faster than what we're seeing right now? Yeah, short-term, probably not. This is just a sticky issue politically. There's no consensus, I think, on either side as to moving something forward. And a couple of years ago, the late Representative Ronald Grijalva and Senator Martin Heinrich introduced a whole suite of reforms to modernize the 1872 Mining Act. And it ran into a lot of opposition from more conservative members of Congress and even some Democrats who didn't want to be seen as standing in the way of mining. And again, these weren't measures to block mining, just to increase oversight over their operations and, again, do a lot more of that abandoned mine cleanup issues like that. So it just shows you how intractable this issue is and that this law has fundamentally not changed in more than 100 years. It's incredible how it hasn't changed, it hasn't been amended substantially, again, in more than 100 years.

I'm your host, Eklavvya Gupte, and in this episode, we will discuss a topic with significant implications for both geopolitics and energy security, the prospects of Russian gas. Now, recent peace talks over Ukraine between Russia and the US have sparked speculation about the potential return of large-scale Russian gas flows to Europe. Many are wondering whether Russia will ever return as an integral energy supplier to Europe. So to start us off, we have our correspondent, Kamila Nashad. Hello, Kamila. Hi, Eklavvya. So, as we know, Russia was once a major supplier of gas to Europe, but that obviously changed with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. And despite ongoing peace talks led by the US, the European Commission has doubled down on its commitment to completely eliminate Russian gas imports. However, as we know, the story is evolving rapidly, and recent years have shown us that energy markets can be very unpredictable. Yeah, that's right. Before the war, Russian gas made up over 40% of pipeline deliveries into the European Union. And that's partly because of geographic proximity, but also a belief by major buyers such as Germany that these economic ties would ensure political partnership or at least prevent hostilities. And in the early days of the war, the EU launched its Repower EU plan to wean itself off Russian gas. And that involved a sharp increase in LNG imports and a reduction of gas consumption in the EU. Now, since then, new partnerships with gas suppliers have been established, not least one with the US on LNG imports. And in 2023, the share of Russian gas in the EU mix dropped to 8%. At the same time, as you mentioned, efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have intensified in recent weeks. And that brings the question to the forefront, is there any way back for Russian gas into the EU system? Now, while no one can predict the future, we are very lucky to have an expert guest on the show today who can explain the possible scenarios for us. And that is Laurent Roussekes, Executive Director for Global Gas at S&P Global Commodity Insights. Laurent, welcome to Energy Evolution. Thanks for having me. Now, maybe we can start with the EU's current policy stance on Russian gas. Since the war is very much still ongoing, what is the EU's position? Are we seeing any openness to restarting higher imports? Short answer is no, we're not seeing it publicly. But to go back to your introduction, and Repower EU laid out the goal that is still the goal, which is to phase out all Russian gas by 2027. But we have to keep in mind that that goal was a soft goal, it's not binding. And it didn't really have anything to do with the decline in Russian pipeline deliveries to Europe in 2022. What happened is that Vladimir Putin cut off the gas, Gazprom manufactured a phony crisis with the compressors driving gas through Nord Stream 1 to Germany, and essentially over the course of August 2022, shut off the gas in an attempt to push Europe, to force Europe to back off from its support for Ukraine. And there were never any sanctions on Russian gas, it was Putin shutting off the gas. So that is in the background of European policymakers when they think about that. From a policy point of view, which is not the whole story, the view is, we have to still wean ourself off Russian gas, and we still have this what I would call a soft target of 2027. And as the policy side, what about company buyers? Do you have a sense on whether European gas imports have any qualms about Russian gas, irrespective of policy, maybe when it comes to reliability, as you just mentioned, or even reputational risk? I think that there's certainly, in the context of an ongoing war that Russia has launched against Ukraine, there's obviously reputation risk. The only buyers who were continuing to buy Russian gas are the handful of contracts that were still valid, the biggest ones in Slovakia, and in Hungary, which are two countries that are compared to the rest of Europe more aligned with Russia. But I would say that, look at it in two different ways. Number one, Gazprom had 20 to 25 long term contracts with European counterparties as of the beginning of 2022. So most of those contracts have been probably suspended. We don't know exactly. Some have been formally terminated. So there are these latent contracts there from 2022. Some will have expired during the intervening years. So that's one issue. Second issue, and I would focus really on Germany here, is a sense in German industry that energy prices, which means natural gas prices, and then wholesale electricity prices, which are heavily driven in most of Europe by gas prices, are still too high. Prices actually got back to almost normal levels at the start of 2024, and then rose over the course of the whole year and put us back to where we are now in the sort of low 40s euros per megawatt hour. And that's a level where you have some German industry, I think, quietly saying, if there is a peace agreement, maybe we should look at least temporarily bringing back Russian gas to bring down prices. Now, part of this picture is obviously the infrastructure. And you just mentioned Germany, two of the flagship pipelines, Nord Stream 1, which was of course destroyed in the early days of the war, and then Nord Stream 2, which was never actually commissioned, are potentially still open questions. You hear different perspectives from different industry players to what extent there's any route back for these two pipelines into operation. What do you think about that? What will happen with Nord Stream 2? And are there any expectations that Nord Stream 1 would ever be repaired? Well, the prerequisite is a balanced and sustainable peace agreement in Ukraine, which we can come back to later. So that's the starting point for any of this. Were there to be such an agreement, I think there are four, each of those two projects, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, each consists of two strings, which 27.5 BCM annual capacity apiece. Three of the four strings were blown up in late September 2022, about four weeks after Putin had cut all gas flow through Nord Stream 1. One string of Nord Stream 2 is still there, but that is under US sanction. And that also was never certified, as you noted, by the German government or by the EU. So Nord Stream 1, the two lines that were destroyed, could more easily, without regard for US sanctions or anything like that, be brought back online. But that would require some non-insignificant spending on the part of the shareholders, which is 50% Gazprom and 50% a number of European companies to reconstruct that. That's an idea that is sort of, I think it's sort of out there a little bit, but there's nothing definite right now. And again, it would depend on political climate being appropriate for that. Laurent, there were recently headlines about a potential prospect of someone buying out Nord Stream 2 out of bankruptcy. Do you think that is a realistic idea? Well, Nord Stream 2, which is 100% owned by Gazprom, is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings in Switzerland. And there was a story in November 2024 in the Wall Street Journal with some entrepreneur with experience in Russian American saying he was looking at buying the assets, which includes one pipeline that was not destroyed out of bankruptcy. And then more recently, there's been some reporting, both in the US and in Germany, that this plan is kind of still on the table and that the Trump administration, people in the Trump administration are aware of it. So this, in Germany, certainly is stimulating a lot of speculation for sure. I think it's pretty unlikely. And it's kind of, I think it's very hard to understand what is going on here and what's happening to trigger the very good reporting that's been done. But basically, I don't think it's very likely that in that sort of circumstance that the Nord Stream 2 existing line could be used. And obviously, the political climate includes the US and the US, as I mentioned in the intro, has stepped in to the void by sending more LNG to Europe since 2022, often fetching very attractive prices. So how do you think the US administration is thinking about a future return of Russian gas into Europe when it comes to their interests? Well, I think there's been a change in the way that I and a lot of other analysts perceive this important question. If you go back to right after Donald Trump was reelected, but before he had taken office, I think the conventional wisdom was Donald Trump doesn't like Russian gas. He's on record criticizing Germany bitterly for being, quote unquote, completely dependent on Russia because it was importing a lot of Russian gas. And he said, you're giving Russia billions and you're asking the US to defend you. So the view there was that Trump had the stated goal of stopping the war, but that he would try to do that in a way that that maybe kept Russian gas tied up, which would be beneficial in general for US LNG exports. I think now the conventional wisdom is, and there's evidence to back this up, is that Trump is very focused on getting a deal, being the person who, as he says, the only person who could bring peace to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. And that in this context, he's willing to deal and he's willing to consider gas. There was Steve Whitkoff, his envoy who went to Moscow a couple weeks ago and spent unbelievably three hours with Vladimir Putin, came back last week and did an interview and said, one of the things we could be cooperating with Russia on is exporting LNG together. Nobody knows what he meant, but it's obviously on the table that something could happen. And it's quite clear that the Trump administration does not strongly oppose any return of Russian gas in the context of whatever ceasefire President Trump is trying to achieve. And I'd like to jump in here and ask how the gas market's really reacting to these big changes that we're seeing on the geopolitical front. Prices are still fairly volatile, especially Dutch TTF gas prices are still quite high. So are there any sort of indicators that suggest a shift in market sentiment? I think the gas market has been overreacting to the news flow since February 12th, when Trump and Putin had their first publicly known phone call with regard to the situation in Ukraine. And I think in the gas market, they sort of look and they think, well, something's happening. There could be a ceasefire. There could be a peace agreement. By the way, those are two different things. And then Russian gas could come back to the market. And so the news flow on almost a daily basis or weekly basis is you can see it in reactions and in TTF, as you mentioned. I mean, I think, in fact, that we're not really, in my view, headed in a direction toward the type of ceasefire peace agreement that would provide a political context for where Russian gas could return by pipeline to Europe. So I think those odds are much, much lower than commonly believed. But there's no question that the news flow about this is driving the market on a sort of intraday volatility basis. So we mentioned in the beginning that, you know, these peace and ceasefire negotiations are ongoing. And I guess the most important question and the foundation for any talk on Russian gas returning to the EU is whether there will be a fair, real peace deal, as Ukraine calls for. I think there's, broadly speaking, there's two ways this negotiation could go. The US as a broker in between the two sides, Europe, which has to be part of the solution and is obviously critical in any solution where gas returns at the table. I think that's what in people's minds in Europe when they think maybe Russian gas could come back. A real peace agreement accepted by Ukraine with Europe at the table as part of the negotiations. And then we could start to think about Russian gas coming back in the context of a peace settlement. What's happening, I think, instead, and we've seen this pretty clearly, is that what you really have is a bilateral US-Russia negotiation with Ukraine playing a secondary role. So the fear, I think, from the Ukrainian side is that US and Russia will agree to terms and sort of impose those on Ukraine. And Europe, by the way, is not really at the table. So that's the kind of context where, you know, if that were to happen, you have a settlement sort of imposed on Ukraine that's not very beneficial to Ukraine. I don't think Europe is going to feel very secure. I don't think Europe is going to feel very comfortable about its relationship with a emboldened Russia going forward, with the Trump administration less committed clearly to defending Europe in the context of NATO. So I don't think that's one where European politicians would be comfortable going back and saying, okay, let's restart gas supply from Russia. I think the first question we have to ask, are we tending toward US-Russia bilateral discussions with Europe on the outside and Ukraine sort of being pushed to accept whatever terms are agreed? And I think that path leads toward very low likelihood of gas coming back. So I think we really will need to see if we want to start thinking there's a higher percentage of a deal in which Russian gas starts flowing through pipelines to Europe again, is something where things change completely and Europe is at the table. And Ukraine and Russia are seen to be both kind of equal in the eyes of the US negotiators, which has not been very visible so far. So that's the basic picture. Then there's the side issue of Arctic II LNG, where no matter what happens or whether it's a fair deal or an unfair deal or a sustainable deal or not, regardless of what Europe thinks of it, the US can unilaterally lift the sanctions it has placed on Arctic II LNG, which would then flow. I don't think the EU could, even if it wanted to, would be very able to substitute EU sanctions to keep that project sort of bottled up. So that would add over time about 10 million tons per year of LNG or about 14 BCM per year onto the market. So that would be significant in and of itself. Okay. And staying on the sort of gas market front, if you are Australia or Qatar or some of the big sort of gas supplies, how are you viewing the current market and what's your strategy in the coming years, especially with maybe more gas coming online in the years to come? Well, that's absolutely right. So, I mean, if you just take, put Russian pipeline gas to the side for a moment and just look at the global LNG supply demand balance, you have a lot of LNG coming online later this year, 2026, 2027, from a variety of sources, but mainly from a number of U.S. projects and then also from Qatar. And so our view is that in 2026 and then into 2027, especially, this supply surge will start to bring prices down from their elevated levels. And this affects both TTF in Europe and then the JKM benchmark for Asian LNG. So that's the picture people are looking at. We hosted the Sierra Week conference in Houston a couple of weeks ago, and this was a lot of companies were saying, look, we're in LNG for the long term. We're very bullish about the long term of LNG. We understand it's a cyclical business and we understand there's probably a period of lower prices ahead. So that's the broader context. If you had a substantial amount of Russian gas returning, we've been focusing on pipeline gas to Europe, but this could also mean Arctic 2 LNG, which has been stymied by U.S. sanctions. Maybe if those sanctions were lifted, that's a non-negligible amount of new LNG on the market that could bring forward and make deeper this lower price environment that is probably coming anyway. Okay. Now, very interesting. And maybe just a question on sort of energy infrastructure. I know Camilla referred to that earlier on, and we've seen a few, some of the talks right now are focusing on energy infrastructure or a ceasefire around that. So how is the gas market viewing that, considering a lot of the gas and power facilities and oil refineries, for example, have been sort of the main targets? Well, the last thing that happened in this regard was, I believe it was last Friday, the gas metering station where some of the pipelines that until January 1st of this year were delivering Russian gas through Ukraine to Europe, that blew up. So and obviously some above ground pipelines filled with gas blew up because there's a huge fireball you can see in videos people posted on Telegram. So this means that, I mean, Slovakia in particular had been pushing to keep Russian gas flowing through Ukraine after January 1st, which was the expiry of the five-year transit agreement signed in late 2019 between Russia and Ukraine. So there's nothing to talk about now because without that facility, which is right at the Russian Ukrainian border getting repaired, you can't flow Russian gas or anyone else's gas through Ukraine to Europe. But look, in the context of the best case scenario of a peace deal, obviously that just gets fixed. It's not a long term problem. Thank you both. That was a fascinating discussion. And I know the market is sort of eagerly awaiting all the drama and curveballs that we might see in the coming days and weeks. The Energy Evolution podcast is hosted by me and Taylor Korkendahl.

I'll do that. I'm joined by our correspondent Camilla Nasrik. Hey Camilla Hey Taylor. Hey, so, can you bring us up to speed? Why is this issue such a priority for the EU? Yeah, so there are obvious economic challenges for European companies We've talked about competition from China in the past on on the show You know things like high rates of import of solar panels into Europe those have really forced many local manufacturers to close and While the energy crisis now is behind us energy costs are still elevated for many consumers especially if you think about energy intensive industries who are really struggling to compete and that obviously raises the specter of risk around employment and industrial decline and You just mentioned the US new trade tensions are rising as well with tariffs announced by President Donald Trump Those are expected to be bad news, especially for car exporters Including those who make EVs now a bit all of this the European Commission says it's focusing on shoring up competitiveness for industry to prevent companies from relocating to regions with cheaper energy or more generous subsidies and the most recent Legislation on this was presented in late February under the name clean industrial deal Okay, so I knew you wrote a story on the clean industrial deal at the time, but just remind our listeners what's in that policy? Yes, so one of the main aims is to reduce electricity costs for industries and especially the volatility of energy bills The EU wants to do that through power purchase agreements and contracts for difference for renewable energy Now as part of that the European Investment Bank will support this plan with 500 billion euros worth of counter guarantees There will also be 100 billion euros mobilized to support EU made clean technology manufacturing This money will come from state aid from the European Innovation Fund and from additional revenues from the carbon market ETS So today we'll be diving deeper into the current trade and investment numbers when it comes to clean tech things like solar panels batteries EVs and Whether a plan like the clean industrial deal will be enough to entice companies to invest in Europe We'll also compare it to the US inflation reduction act Well, that's obviously many times more generous in terms of subsidies that may actually not be all that matters All right, let's get into it Let's hear from Ben McWilliams affiliate fellow at European policy and economics think-tank Bruegel He specializes on energy and climate policy and has co-authored a recent report on the clean industrial deal With a focus on trade and investment All right, Ben. Thank you so much for joining us on energy evolution Maybe if you want to start us off with explaining why we're here why we're having this conversation at this moment in Europe Can you explain to our listeners why you think it's so important for Europe the European Union? To focus right now on showing up the industrial competitiveness via clean tech at this specific time Hi Camilla many. Thanks for the invitation to come on the podcast the European Union has So far in my opinion, and I think many people's opinion being very successful and Perhaps world leading in both passing policies to achieve Carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emission reductions and also actually achieving greenhouse gas reductions over the last 15 years There have been Substantial emission reductions in the EU and there is now a policy suite in place Which was passed during the first term of President von der Leyen which sets a credible pathway for the EU to achieve a 90% emissions reduction by 2040 and full carbon neutrality by 2050. Now Ursula von der Leyen when she announced the Green Deal called it Europe's new growth plan or words to that extent and For the political and social sustainability of the Green Deal and of carbon emission reductions in the EU it is imperative that it actually is Europe's new growth plan and Specifically now what we will be talking about today is that Europe must ensure that decarbonization does not occur alongside relative Industrialization, that is to say that decarbonization isn't simply achieved by energy intensive and carbon emitting industries simply Relocating abroad and you're importing such products Now the EU has the carbon border adjustment which looks to prevent this from importing dirty products But what we will discuss today and what is key is that there's a sufficient framework in place Inside the European Union to make a business case for industries to make investments in new green value chains, which will create new green jobs in Europe and new green industries in Europe and occur alongside this decarbonization process and for the political and social Sustainability of this that's really key particularly with the the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy price of 2022 with pressures from China and increasingly pressures from America over the last few weeks. This has only risen up the political agenda. You just mentioned America China and I guess that is part of this competitiveness idea that Europe wants to build up its own industries and support the manufacturing locally of technologies like solar batteries EVs, etc And I know you've done research on the trade Elements of these clean tech technologies So, can you give us an overview of what the trade picture in Europe currently looks like on things like solar EVs and batteries? this is not occurring in a vacuum this push for Europe to develop leadership in clean tech industries and energy intensive industries and The narrative of the last 10 years or so has been that China has really been a first mover in this space And China has developed strong competences particularly along battery and electric vehicle value chains with this sense of panic now in Europe and I think also in in North America that They need their own industries to develop and be able to compete with the Chinese and then from a European perspective what really kicked off this discussion with America was the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act a couple of years ago now which gave and continues to give very generous subsidies for manufacturing in the US and that's also Part of the cause of some work at Bruegel we now perform with rhodium to compare investments and trade in the EU and in America So far we've our ambition is to cover all clean techs and also energy intensive technologies So far we've looked particularly into solar and batteries and we're currently in the process of looking into electric vehicles What we see so far if we begin with solar is that the EU is a net importer I mean imports into the EU of solar panels are significant and exports are almost negligible Essentially all solar imports come from China. We saw a peak in 2022 2023 Following the energy crisis when price of solar slightly peaked and solar imports reached something like 2 billion monthly That's now fallen to something closer to a billion monthly the other significant clean tech imports into the EU are batteries Again, these are dominated by China not to the same degree as solar imports are there's a little bit more of a diversified pool Of importers, but China is still key and these are roughly around 2.5 billion euros monthly so about double the import of solar panels in terms of value on the export side that the main Clean tech which Europe exports are electric vehicles These are about 3 billion monthly exports about a billion net So Europe is a net exporter of electric vehicles, which I think often is as a fact lost in the debate The largest recipients of these exports are the US and the UK Which makes the recent tariffs from Trump and this discussion on tariffs on vehicles It highlights the concern here for the EU because not only exporting Fossil vehicles to the US, but also there is an industry growing in Europe based upon exporting electric vehicles to the US And on the import side on electric vehicles again, China is important But perhaps another fact to to straight is that I think sometimes the role of Chinese electric vehicle imports Into the EU is slightly overplayed There's this sense that China has already run away and is dominating in exports into the EU That's not quite the case. China has big advantages and has a big domestic market but roughly one in five electric vehicles in the EU are imported from China and Roughly one in five vehicles in the EU are electric So you're looking at something like one in twenty one in twenty five Vehicles that are on the road that are registered in the EU is an electric vehicle imported from China So it's good to monitor this and it's which is what European leaders are doing It's good to monitor this and keep an eye on it But it's certainly not the case in electric vehicles that China Already dominates the trade into the EU like it doesn't solar panels and there's still substantial space here for European companies to grow and Dominate the electric vehicle market domestically. I also wanted to touch on investment trends I mean we're speaking today on the day where Swedish battery maker Northvolt announced a bankruptcy. So one major Hopeful European player may be no longer on the scene at least in the same way. You just touched on solar there. We've seen manufacturers closing down in in Scores in the last couple of years due to this high rate of imports from China So, how can we look at this market for investments in clean tech in Europe? How has that evolved and maybe you can even zoom into certain markets where you see? More happening than elsewhere from our our investment tracking the sectors that we've particularly covered so far The solar sector the battery sector and we're in the process of updating the electric vehicle sector The solar sector as you mentioned is not a case for much investment in the EU This sector is dominated by imports in China and investments in the EU have really struggled I mean, I'm not seeing there are some cases, but there are not really serious investments into solar panel manufacturing in the EU The battery case is different in batteries. We're actually seeing significant growth in investments in the EU from somewhere around 1 billion euros quarterly in 2021 to closer to 3 4 billion euros quarterly as of the last quarter 2024 So we're seeing pretty strong growth in European investment into battery manufacturing This is also translating into pretty significant capacities that are available in Europe it's somewhere between two-thirds and all of domestic demand in the EU can be met with Manufacturing in the EU and if we look at final investment decisions and projects in the construction That roughly that trajectory is going to be continued over the next few years As you mentioned in the question there are threats to the closure of Northvolt Final investment decisions projects in the construction can be cancelled, but the case in battery manufacturing I would argue is reasonable for Europe Not like the US again comparing our investment data with investment data from the rhodium group in the US We're able to see that US investments into battery manufacturing From a similar position as Europe in 2021 have grown substantially quicker to something like 12 billion Dollars quarterly. So again, that's compared to about 4 billion in Europe So somewhere on the order of three times larger in the US so that they're certainly larger and but in Europe we're seeing significant battery manufacturing investment and Then finally from electric vehicles as I say this is work that we're currently doing but so far the signs are that there are pretty reasonable investments into the electric vehicle manufacturing chain in Europe. One thing to point out is that These value chains are fed with earlier inputs things like lithium refining Producing cathodes which are the key ingredient for a battery and in these earlier value chain stages That's where Europe has almost none or very limited competencies. These earlier value chain stages aren't particularly Important from a pure economic standpoint. There isn't really a lot of value added a lot of jobs attached to these value chain stages but the key concern to keep in mind for Europe is Not having excessive dependence on one country e.g China for these early value chain stages and ensuring that you have diversified supply It's really interesting So I know you looked at this as well and maybe you can say a few words on Where are the the geographies within Europe where most or much of these investments are happening and why? That's a I mean a really key question and a controversial one I mean, we're seeing a few competing trends. There are the industrial legacy bases For example in Germany and the Ruhr Valley Etc where we're seeing investments happen and this is driven likely by The agglomeration benefits and being close to legacy fossil industries, for example Automobile manufacturers when they roll out a new electric vehicle manufacturing facility often do this Inside or adjacent to an existing fossil car manufacturing facility likewise for certain other industries So we see this one driver of investments, which is that they're close to Or they're driven by existing fossil bases and kind of where big industries are today I think a second driver which we're slowly starting to see in the data and it's not yet clear how strong this effect will be is a slight renewable pull so this notion that When you have particularly energy intensive value chain stages They locate in places with abundant sun or abundant wind or abundant hydro resources a good example of this is the Hydrogen bank auction from the european union, which was six months ago or so now where Most of the winning bids were from countries like spain portugal with good solar resources And also from countries in the nordics with good wind resources good hydro resources and also a lot of available land So that's that's two driving factors And probably the final one which I would raise is Maybe I would call it the hungary case Which is that there are a lot of battery manufacturing investments in hungary Part of this is a welcomeness to foreign direct investment, particularly from china The biggest project if it reaches full capacity under construction in hungary is in the area called debrecen From cattle the big chinese battery manufacturer and there are also other large Investments going on in hungary and particularly in central eastern europe. It's really interesting and I Was really struck by the figures you named around the differences between us versus european Investment trajectories. So saying explaining you're explaining how much faster Investments have grown in the us and i'm presuming that it's partly due to the More supportive incentives there and that brings me to my final question Which is of course the clean industrial deal that the european commission presented two weeks ago now essentially trying to match this trying to ramp up the existing Proposals and concepts that are out there for increasing investments in clean technologies Now that you've had a chance to kind of analyze the details of this Legislation how impactful do you think this will be? so to begin on the comparison between The us and the eu The us in the last couple of years has definitely been more successful in attracting clean technology manufacturing investments And this will translate into larger operational capacities. I do think one risk to to highlight here is that the Inflation reduction act subsidies are so generous That they also likely lead to perhaps some Overinvestment or some investments that aren't so efficient in the us because of these attractive government subsidies I think I remember a statistic for solar manufacturing that the The subsidy per panel or per watts in the us the subsidy volume alone from the government Was larger than the cost of producing the total cost of producing panels in china So this is a very generous subsidy scheme, which is is great in terms of stimulating investments But when comparing these european and american numbers there is also the risk that american numbers are essentially inflated by the fact that Investments that perhaps aren't always as viable a business case go ahead That being said the clean industrial deal, which was released by the european commission a couple of weeks ago Now is the latest attempt from the eu to outline Its strategy for how green industry can thrive in a decarbonizing europe This is not out of the blue. It's not the first strategy here There was the net zero industry act about a year ago now, which also laid out another set of rules and guidelines For how the eu wanted to achieve this as with all european commission communications It takes a little bit of time We need to wait a few weeks and months to see how negotiations go on the topic how this is implemented in actual countries and particularly For example, there's this commitment for somewhere on the order of 100 billion euros for a decarbonization bank It's never exactly clear Where this money comes from and we have to wait and see if it will really materialize if it does materialize 100 billion euros to be distributed at european level For decarbonizing industry is a very exciting proposition And if this money could be distributed in a sensible manner perhaps learning from the eu's hydrogen bank with this double-sided auction that tries to really Reduce the the volume of subsidy needed in order to make one euro go as far as possible I think this is very exciting and you know Greater disbursement of funds at european level which takes advantage of the whole geography of europe and puts funds to where they can Go to most effect is exciting. I think that's that's key. I think now for european industry is this commercialization this helping industries The eu has the innovation fund under the ets and has very strong universities strong researchers Good development of patents and really is leading or not leading But it is a strong force in the early stages of innovation of these products I think what has been missing and what needs to be the focus now is how you take these early stage innovations and ensure they materialize into value chains that are present in europe and that really commercialize and grow production to produce Serious volumes of for example, green steel of batteries, etc Brilliant so yeah, lots of great perspectives there on this crucial question of green industrial competitiveness Thank you so much ben for sharing those insights and some of the research that you and the team at brugel have done Thanks for joining us.

I'm Eklavya Gupte and we've just wrapped up an exciting few days from CERA Week in Houston, Texas. And my co-host, Daler Kirkendall, still has a few more interviews to share from the event. That's right, Eklavya. Today I'm bringing you the last three interviews from our talks with folks at CERA Week, one of the largest energy business gatherings in the world. We're wrapping up coverage of the conference with some discussions centered around public funding for energy projects in the United States, particularly as we see these differences start to unfold between the Trump administration and the Biden administration. Our guests today include Ernest Moniz. He's the founder and CEO of EFI Foundation and was the former US Department of Energy Secretary during the Obama administration. We're also going to talk to Vass Energy CEO Craig Wood and Plug Power Chief Strategy Officer Sanjay Shrestha. See, Vass is a concentrated solar company and Plug Power is developing hydrogen fuel cell systems and both companies have benefited from DOE programs in the past, so I think it's gonna be interesting for you to hear how they're thinking about this change. Let's dive right into our interview with Ernest Moniz from the sidelines of CERA Week to hear the perspective of someone who once led the US Department of Energy. Ernest, thank you for joining the show. Pleasure to be see you again. And welcome back. I believe you might hold the record for the most appearances on the podcast. Always a great guest. Really appreciate that. Told people a few more, a few more visits, I think, from co-host status. But I'm just wondering, you know, it's a completely different political environment than the last time you and I spoke. I'm just wondering, what can we do to make sure that, you know, clean energy projects still look appealing to investors, even if maybe, you know, we're not seeing big promises of things like the Inflation Reduction Act or maybe a more supportive, you know, US government? Well, first of all, of course, we've always had challenges for investors in the sense that we still feel that there's a lot more capital available right now than there are final investment decisions being made. But clearly the environment has changed. I do want to say that if we go back to President Trump's first administration, there were various actions taken that were viewed as counter to addressing clean energy transition dynamics. But on the other hand, frankly, we as a country kept moving forward. A large part of that was what was happening in the states and cities. Another large part of it was that the private sector, you know, recognized where we are going, perhaps at an unknown pace and scale, but that the destination was fairly clear and that the kinds of long-term capital commitments made in the energy industry were not going to deviate strongly from that. I believe both of those dynamics remain in place on the plus side. On the other side, I think an important dynamic in the first Trump administration was that Congress continued to have very, very strong support for the, let's call it the innovation agenda. Innovation, though, all along the innovation chain, from early stage to some demonstrations and deployment support. That, I think, is much more in question today. Not the inherent bipartisanship. I don't believe that has actually changed fundamentally. And that includes a lot of the pressure one is seeing today for continuing at least many of the IRA incentives, a number of the infrastructure law programs. The Science and Chips Act is a subject of some contention within the Republican caucus, for example. But on the other hand, I think the new dynamic that does change the equation is the enormous fiscal pressure that is the case now, that I would argue was nowhere near as severe in President Trump's first administration. The reality is, you know, COVID happened. That was one of the factors leading to inflation. The reality is that in the last year, the cost of debt service, $900 billion, the deficit double that, $1.8 trillion. Basically, the deficit, the annual deficit, was about a third of federal revenues. The national debt, if you include public and privately held debt, well beyond the annual GDP. So these fiscal pressures, look, they're real. I think they were going to have to be faced by anybody. And I think they cannot be ignored entirely much longer. So now, of course, we hear, and the President has said, well, Social Security is off the table. Medicare and Medicaid are off the table. The mandatory outlays, the debt service is whatever it is. The national security is off the table, maybe even getting an increase. Well, the reality is, you cannot find appreciable savings on the scale of our deficit from the remainder of the budget. It just isn't there. So we've got a reckoning coming, and among the victims of that could very, very well be a number of the energy programs. So it's a long way around, coming back to your question, but I think that's the reality, that the fiscal pressures are going to come down hard, I think. Yeah. And as you're well aware, climate change is a global problem, right? And those require a lot of international competition. At the same time, we've got a President kind of throwing around these, you know, lots of trade actions on people that we see as our allies. I'm wondering, in your kind of experiences, you're out there, like, talking to people around the world, how are they thinking differently about partnering with the U.S. on clean energy projects, whether that's with the U.S. itself or, you know, private companies here? Well, I think there's no doubt that uncertainty has been put into the, injected into the system in ways that are not easily reversed. Even when some of the actions maybe are reversed or not implemented in the first place, the very discussion of them has caused tremendous uncertainty. And certainly, if there are major trade actions, impediments lifted, the effect on prices on American consumers will definitely be there. Now, maybe there'll be some positive outcomes there, such as more manufacturing ultimately moving to the United States, which will be viewed, at least domestically, as a positive. But there'll also be the negatives, where others who depend upon our supply, our role in their supply chains, say, well, we also have to make our supply chain more resilient. And I don't think anybody knows how this will play out, only that it is a huge dynamic that we have not gone through before. Yeah. Number two, as we see this change in the political economic environment, do you see any change in the ways that maybe investors or financial institutions or politicians are thinking about in terms of, are there certain sectors of the clean energy economy that are more investable, more bankable, more bipartisan than other sectors of the clean energy economy? Well, look, I think the issue is that there's a lot of uncertainty right now, especially around essentially capital costs. If inflation returns or inflation does not subside, commodities continue to get more expensive, lumber, steel, you name it, that projects can get priced out of implementation. I think we've already seen a lot of that in the last years with offshore wind, for example, where costs went up and purchase power agreements, which had been entered into prior to the cost rise, no longer looked viable for the developers and they canceled projects. And that's a reality. So I think that the financial world is holding their breath, waiting to see how things play out and what the implications will be for things like commodity prices. People forget that, you know, the price of steel, the price of copper, et cetera, really matters in building a project, the price of concrete, you know, et cetera. On the other hand, areas where there may be less impact would be on the integration of various information technologies into energy systems. AI, of course, is right now the poster child for that, a lot of opportunity. And I think that companies with really good ideas there, ideas that don't take many years to come into reality, that may not require the kind of permitting challenges that some physical infrastructure does, those probably are less impacted by the uncertainty right now. But we can't build a new energy system just on soft technologies, if you like. Thank you so much for joining the podcast again. Pleasure. You're live at Sarah Week with the CEO of Vast, Craig Wood. Vast is a leader in concentrated solar thermal power. But just to get us started, tell us what we mean when we say concentrated solar power. Sure. So concentrated solar thermal power is different from solar photovoltaics. What we do is we use mirrors that are curved to capture and concentrate the sun's energy. And rather than store that as chemical energy, like you might in a battery, we actually store it as thermal energy in the form of heat. That's an important distinction because thermal energy, when it's built at scale, is actually far cheaper and more effective than chemical batteries. So if you need to provide, for example, nighttime solar, 12 to 20 hours of storage, it's far cheaper to do that if you're in a sunny location using solar thermal than what it is to do it with a combination of photovoltaics and batteries. The other interesting point about solar thermal is that we can provide electricity because we can take the heat, create steam in a turbine. But we can also use that heat directly. And it's extremely efficient and hence very cost effective to use the heat directly. So if you wanted to, for example, have an e-fuels plant to make avgas for aeroplanes through green methods, it's about 60 percent the cost to do that using solar thermal technology because of that combination of heat and power versus what it would be to try and do the same thing using PV, wind and batteries alone. Tell us a little bit about the history of concentrated solar power. I know that there's been some some hiccups along the road to getting that off the ground. And tell us what happens for our listeners who aren't familiar with it, but also what makes Bass differ. Yeah, sure. Look, it's an interesting story. And actually, U.S. companies and U.S. technology, U.S. investment through the DOE has been a really important part of that for more than 50 years. So the technology itself has sort of gone through, we think about it in three ways. The first of those was a technology called parabolic troughs. And there were some plants built here in the U.S., very large plants built in the 80s that are actually still running and just in the process of being decommissioned now. That technology, the parabolic troughs, it's what they call a line focusing system. And what was pioneered here in the States has actually now been built at sort of gigawatt scale. There's about seven gigawatts globally, a lot of it in Spain, Chile, Morocco, China, basically everywhere where it's sunny has had generation one of the technology built. The challenge with that generation one was ultimately it's proven to be too expensive. And the reason for that is the temperatures that are achieved in the line focusing system are limited to just under 400 Celsius. So people tried to move to generation two systems, which are central tower systems. Again, the U.S. was one of the early adopters there. Ivanpah, which has been in the news, was a version of that. There's another plant called Crescent Dunes, again, built out in the West, that was one of the early plants. The challenge with that technology has proven to be really a reliability issue. What happens with the central towers, you've got a sort of 750 foot tall central tower, and you've got about a thousand suns focusing up on that point up in the sky. And the issue with that is that when clouds come and go, you get very big changes in the amount of energy received. And for a bunch of pretty sort of deep technical reasons, that's proven to be very difficult to manage. So what's happened now is, and really what my company has done, is pioneered the third generation of the technology, where what we've done is we've taken the modularity and the controllability of the generation one technology, the parabolic troughs, and we've coupled that with a modular tower design, so we still have the point focusing and the high temperature benefits of generation two. So that modular tower design, which is, you know, in our case we use liquid sodium metal to link the towers together as a heat transfer fluid, that's really the big innovation that Vasta's pioneered for now nearly 15 years. Ivanpah is the elephant in the room, right, and it's received a lot of media coverage. I think it's important to understand what Ivanpah was. So if you wind the clock back nearly 15 years, which is when construction first started, solar thermal was actually by far and away the cheapest option for turning solar energy into electricity. And Ivanpah was conceived as essentially an industrial pilot for what was envisaged to be a whole series of solar thermal plants that were built across the US. Now a couple of things have happened in the meantime. Most importantly, sometime around the late teens, so 2018-2019, the investment in the supply chain in photovoltaics meant that all of a sudden they came way down the cost curve far quicker than anyone expected. And so, you know, in hindsight sitting here in 2025 it's kind of easy to say, oh well PV's so much cheaper, what were they thinking 15 years ago? But the reality was solar thermal was cheaper back then and Ivanpah was all about making that superior technology back then even more cheap so that it could be, you know, do the heavy lifting in terms of energy supply. The other thing that is important to understand is that Ivanpah, when it was built, did not have intrinsic storage. So it's a direct steam system where the sunlight actually creates steam in the receiver and then they run turbines directly. If you look at what that delivers you, basically it delivers you energy at the same time as when the sun's shining, which is exactly what PV does. So again, in a straight shootout you lose on cost every day of the week. If Ivanpah had storage it would be a different proposition because, unfortunately for the fans of PV, there is this fundamental issue that we have called night time and the ability to shift bulk energy from day to night is something that solar thermal is actually very well equipped to do. You can use batteries to do a little bit of that, like an hour or two, maybe four hours around the edges, but if you want that 12 to 20 hours of dispatchable energy for the grid overnight, solar thermal is still an excellent answer. So, you know, Ivanpah, from what I understand of its operating history, it's actually been a very well-performing plant. It hasn't had financing issues, it hasn't had operating issues, it's actually done very well, but it is, you know, the perception of it now, with the benefit of 2020 hindsight, is that it wasn't a very smart investment. I think it was at the time quite a clever play to try and get technology down the cost curve very rapidly and it just turns out that one of the other technologies beat it. And that was DOE's supported effort, right? Is there something to be said there about those lessons to be learned that the DOE's role maybe in some of the early investment in some of these technologies? Look, if you go back and look at any technology, oftentimes it's required support from government, whether it be through the military or through the DOE, whatever. You know, photovoltaics were exactly the same. If you go and look at, there's a particular type of PV technology called PERC cells, a lot of the fundamental research and development for that was actually done at UNSW, University of New South Wales in Sydney. Now it turns out that that R&D ultimately has ended up being, you know, used by manufacturers all around the world, primarily China. And so, you know, Australia is re-importing technology, photovoltaic technology, in the form of panels from China, using stuff that was invented in a lab in Sydney. So those sorts of, you know, government supports, military supports, you know, sometimes it's large companies. That's just the nature of actually getting these technologies through to maturity. So, you know, in the case of Ivanpah, yes, the DOE was involved. As I said, as I understand it, the financial performance has been good. So I don't think that, you know, the DOE's necessarily had financing issues with it. But ultimately, you know, the DOE was betting on PV, and they were betting on solar thermal, and they're betting on a whole bunch of other technologies. Sometimes those bets work, and that's great, because you have whole new industries like PV and batteries and wind, and sometimes they don't. I'm wondering too, because you mentioned the DOE getting some of this technology off the ground. We've always had a big change in what the DOE looks like now under the administration change. Do you worry about what that means for the energy transition and innovation in that space? Look, it's certainly interesting times, and there's, you know, there's a lot of concern and a lot of, you know, speculation as to what it's all going to mean. If you take a longer view, you know, the technologies that are going to be needed to ultimately transition us away from fossil fuels, most of those have been in development for 50 years. So there's already been ebbs and flows in the political cycle, you know, different different, you know, party in Washington might want to do something versus another one that gets the keys next time around. Ultimately, it's physics and economics that are going to determine which technologies are required and which ones win, and how that mix is actually put together to allow us to win ourselves off fossil fuels. So, you know, we're reasonably sanguine about about what we're doing because it makes sense. You know, for the record, we also think that gas makes sense and we think it's a really important transition fuel. So some of the comments that have been made here at Sarah Week, you know, we're supportive of, we're pragmatists. Yes, we have a renewable technology, it's dispatchable, it produces heat, but the sun doesn't shine all the time, and it's not always windy. And so there's going to be a need for transition fuels like gas. And then ultimately, I think it's probably some form of hydrogen derivative for a long time to come. Yeah. And can you tell us a little bit about the investment environment out there is like for projects like yours, but also maybe renewable energy more generally? Has it changed a lot since the change of administration? Are people more hesitant to invest in these sectors? Or do you have to change how you approach them or talk to me? It's sort of, it's sort of cleaved into two parts, I think. So the, you know, the more mature technologies, PV, wind, batteries, I think, well structured projects, from what I'm hearing, are still getting financed. You know, there again, there's uncertainty around, in particular elements of the Flush Reduction Act, and how all of that's going to play through. But, you know, from the conversations that I've been having around the edges of the conference, it seems that those well-structured projects are still getting done, which is great. You know, I think the reality is, we're going to need more of everything, right? Fossil fire generation, but also renewables. And so it's important, I think, that those markets continue to deploy technology, because ultimately energy demand's going up, driven by data centers here in the US, driven by, you know, general economic growth in other countries around the world. For our technology specifically, the challenges that we have, it's really driven by, I think, where we are in terms of our level of maturity. It's pretty easy to do little stuff, you know, whether it be labs or demonstration plants. Where VAST is at, we're right at the cusp of actually building our first utility scale plant. So there's a significant financing challenge there, and we should have some pretty exciting news on that front coming out in the very near future. It's not easy, though, right? These technologies, there's not that many that we still need to bring through to maturity. Solar thermal that's cost effective and reliable is one of those that I mentioned earlier, that the ability to provide very cheap green heat coupled with dispatchable power really does create opportunities to provide a primary energy source into important markets that don't currently have good answers from a green perspective. So it is important that we get our project done, and we're certainly working hard to take FID on both our 30 megawatt project with eight hours of storage, solar thermal, and then ultimately our green methanol plant as well. So when you're talking to potential investors, what are the concerns you're hearing from them? What are the obstacles you had to overcome as you're trying to get some of these projects funded? Is there anything specific that jumps out constantly? Look, there's probably a couple of different buckets. So there's always a question about, you know, how is the technology new? How have you proven it? And there's a bunch of engineering answers to that. And really, it's just about taking people through that journey and educating them. So that part's doable, takes a fair amount of time, but it's achievable. The other part is more linked to just the nature of what we're doing. So the reality of these technologies I mentioned a moment ago is that Vaast has been in business for 15 years, and we've progressively developed the technology, you know, you design it, you prototype it, you build it, you operate it, you turn it off, you start again at a bigger scale, you do that again and again. So it's a very long development cycle. As we sit here today, you know, we're closing in on FID on our two projects. But ultimately, it's a two to three year build to actually get them to the point where they're operating. And it's only once those are operating, that we really get to then move into doing multiple projects in parallel in multiple markets and really start to make some money. So from an investment perspective, it's challenging, right? It's challenging to have that duration that we need to fund. And frankly, unless the market was big enough, that you were confident that at the end of it, there was a nice prize waiting. It's probably not something you'd be looking to do. Excellent. Craig, thank you so much for joining us on Energy Evolution. Thank you. Hi, I'm here live at Sarah Week with Sanjay Shrestha, the president of Plug Power. It's an American company, they're at the forefront of developing hydrogen fuel systems. This is designed to release traditional batteries and various equipment electric vehicles. Sanjay, did I get that right? Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about Plug Power before we dive into the interview? Well, of course, Taylor, thank you for taking the time.  To meet with us. Look, I think when we think about Plug, what is the mission of the company, right? We're really building a clean hydrogen economy on a global basis. That's really how we think about ourselves, right? In terms of our product, our hydrogen plants, the hydrogen fuel that we supply to our customer. It's really about creating productivity gain, making things easier for them in terms of their operations and things along those lines. So that's really who we are. And we're heads down, focused on our mission and keep driving the company forward from not only the top line growth, but from margin expansion, focusing on reducing our cash burn and really taking the company, you know, every day a step closer to that path of profitability. Excellent. Now, a couple of years ago, two years ago, we were saying we were talking last, it seemed like then that hydrogen was bursting onto the scene, maybe having its moment. I know it's an older technology we've been talking about for a while and new things have developed, but I'm just wondering what's evolved over the last two years. What's, what's, what's, what's gone on in hydrogen? Is it still that hot commodity that it was then? Well, well, Taylor, it's interesting, right? I think it's pretty typical for energy industry. You go through the cycles, if you would, right? There was some excitement at times. There was a bit of a realization at times, but at the end of the day, the role of hydrogen in terms of creating energy security from a domestic standpoint, just hasn't changed, right? Things that hydrogen can do, you know, other sources aren't going to be able to do, right? So I'll come back to the macro in a second, but let's talk about what Plug has been doing and what we have done, right? So since last two years, we've made tremendous progress in terms of really, you know, focusing on releasing our cash burn, number one. Number two, we've built the world's largest liquid green hydrogen plant here in the state of Georgia, in the US, right? So it's a 15 ton liquid plant using 40 megawatt of Plug PEM electrolyzer, 15 tons of liquefaction, you know, plant has been running now since the beginning of 2024. So it's well over a year. So that's a big accomplishment, right? And then beyond that, you know, another thing we've done is we now have installed our electrolyzer product in five different continents. And that is the business where we have now essentially got, you know, over eight gigawatt of front log, you know, when you really think about it. So that really gives a lot of visibility in terms of growth potential for that business. You know, and I think as a company, we're also laser focused on continuing to improving our technology, continue to drive the cost down, continue to improve the reliability at the end of the day, really provide that total cost of ownership for our end customers so that we can continue to grow. So I think when I, you know, when you think about macro, and maybe a change in the sentiment for hydrogen versus what we're doing at Plug, not only is that we did also receive the, you know, final approval for our loan guarantee program with the Department of Energy, you know, for almost $1.7 billion. And first of the plan that we're going to build out of that facility will be our plant in Texas, again, 45 tons per day liquid hydrogen plant, creating tremendous job, again, another piece of energy security puzzle here from a US standpoint. So look, we've been at it. And I think, you know, when you are a sort of the pioneer, if you would, in the industry, there is always going to be, you know, some navigation you're going to have to do, right. So when you're a trailblazer, you're going to run into some challenges, you know, you maneuver through that, and you keep pushing things forward, because hydrogen, but then taking maybe one small step back, so when you just think very immediate term, if you would, right, so given everything that's going on in the world, some level of uncertainty, frankly, from a macro perspective, we as a company, you know, we talked about it on our last earnings call, where, you know, we're even getting sharper in and laser focused on key areas that are more important from a near term standpoint, rather than even from a long term standpoint, right? Longer term price of hydrogen hasn't changed. But from a plug perspective, what are the steps we need to take to get the company to that cash flow break even and closer to that path of profitability, we're really honing in on our material handling business, which is what we've been doing for a very long time after having created the first viable market for hydrogen fuel cell as a turnkey solutions provider. Second biggest focus for us is our electrolyzer business based on what has told you about our front log activity we got going on our Gigafactory in Rochester, you know, largest PEM operating electrolyzer in the western hemisphere in our plant in Georgia. And then look, hydrogen is a pretty important piece of the puzzle to support our customer in the material handling industry. And our focus is to keep driving the cost of that hydrogen down. And the way we can do that is by things like getting Georgia online, getting our plant in Louisiana, which is a partnership with Olin online, which we expect that plan to come online here in this month, right. So in Q1, as we've always said, and then we are continuing to also focus on some of the other areas like our tanker and trailer business, which has been very profitable, generates cash for us that can actually move hydrogen, store hydrogen, and even move some specialty gas along the way. So that's really what we're focused on here in the near term. And I think when you then fast forward, you know, another four to five years, we see that demand for hydrogen is going to continue to go up, you know, and in the near term, demand for hydrogen is likely going to come from displacing gray hydrogen with green hydrogen in areas like refining areas like ammonia, methanol, right. And then I think you start to see a demand, you know, see bigger uptake from products like stationary fuel. So at some point, you should think about long haul trucking and the mobility market as well, really adding that multiplier effect for that hydrogen, if you would, you know, but I think that's probably four to five years out in terms of how that all unfolds. But here for the next 12 to 18 months, that's really what we're focused on. Totally makes sense. So you've been pretty busy, it sounds like since we last talked. I'm just kind of wondering, you know, we, you mentioned the DOE loan, I'm just wondering if we could kind of just, can you speak kind of broadly about where you see the role of the DOE and kind of encouraging newer technologies and coming in and out and, and how that might change as an administration that seems to have some different priorities, especially around climate and energy. Look, we're cautiously optimistic about this, frankly. Look, from our perspective, the most important thing here is we did get the loan guarantee approved. Obviously, the administration, like I guess, any new executive that comes into the office will take three months to evaluate what's right, what's not right. So and look, I think this DOE loan guarantee is supporting our project in Texas, obviously a pretty big Republican county, right? It's a, obviously, needless to say, it's the state of Texas, right, where there's a lot of energy industry. So the way we look at it, I think, you know, look, we're looking forward to working with the new administration, help them understand the importance of hydrogen from the energy security perspective. You know, from the U.S. market standpoint, it can be a fantastic source for a lot of ammonia export and things along those lines. So look, I mean, we continue to have the dialogue, continue to find a path forward. And, you know, as we've said, it's probably not till fourth quarter of this year that there is a clarity in terms of exact disbursement and things like that. And that's kind of the timeline in mind that we have in terms of when we think we will get remobilized with our project in Texas. Yeah. And when you look at the landscape, I mean, do you think you guys have an easier lift than, say, a wind project or a solar project might be trying to get up? Seems like hydrogen does kind of fit more of a bipartisan niche than maybe some of these other technologies. Look, you said that a lot. I think hydrogen's always been a bipartisan topic. Right. It's always had the support from the both side of the aisle. But look, we're trying not to even look at it from that perspective. Right. I mean, let's think about energy and let's think about energy dominance as the country. Right. And if you think about it from that perspective, hydrogen has to play a very critical role. Right. I mean, obviously, the, you know, the climate change benefit, right, sort of the environmental attributes of hydrogen, frankly, is an added benefit. Right. I think. But when you just look at it as like, what is the role of hydrogen in energy from a long duration energy storage standpoint as a source of energy carrier? Right. The way to stabilize the grid with a lot of renewables that's already in the grid. Right. So we which is why we do what we do. Obviously, we believe in this. Right. And, you know, from our perspective, you know, this has a much bigger role to play as a, you know, energy security vector. And look, and we think hydrogen is going to be a much bigger market. And I think, Taylor, when you think about energy does this. Right. I mean, you've got to take a long term view. While I just said we're laser focused on really getting to that cash flow break even here in the next 12 to 18 months, that's a blocking and tacking for the company. Right. To do what you've got to do. Yeah. But from the macro and the energy industry perspective, you know, look, I mean, it's a long term cycle. You've got to take a long term view and not just a view that is six months, eight months or even two to three years. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to do obviously a lot of uncertainty around the political environment, but that's to be expected every four years. Right. I'm wondering if we also forget that that's also definitely trickled out into the private sector and in capital markets. What are you seeing in that space? Is there is are people still excited to go out there and make investments in new energy technologies? Are people say maybe wait and see? Are you seeing investors say like, oh, I'm not so sure now I want to give me a couple of months like what's that look like? Well, I mean, look, I've, you know, so certainly spent a lot of time also meeting with the investors. Right. I think folks are doing the work or they're trying to figure out when is the right time to maybe get even more involved than the way they are. And I think it depends. Right. Well, what are you looking at? You know, if you have a project that has good return, regardless of the administration, I think you're going to find capital. If anything, in a way, this will weed out things that probably shouldn't have moved ahead, frankly. Right. This will create a level of abnormalization in the industry. And every industry needs to go through this. Right. There are projects that make sense. There are projects that actually doesn't probably make sense. Right. So it will really, I think, kind of normalize the industry in terms of moving the projects that have financial merits. And if you have a good return profile, if you have a good, robust project that have gone through a proper development cycle, getting into a final investment decision. Right. So you will see those projects continue to move ahead. But looking at it from plug perspective, though, you know, you're absolutely right. Given this macro environment from policy, trade, every single perspective. Right. So could there be a bit of a slowdown in some of our electrolyzer business or some of the other things that are hydrogen related here in the U.S. in a very immediate short term? Yeah, probably. Folks will look probably for some better clarity before they really start to jump in with the both feet. I think they're testing the water right now to jump in with the both feet. It might take some time. But from our perspective as a company, we have a lot of presence on a global basis, specifically as it relates to our electrolyzer, that eight gigawatt of front log that I referred to, eight out of the ten projects in that is outside of the U.S. Right. It's in Europe. It's in Australia. So the diversity of that model should continue to be OK for plug. But look, we are cautiously optimistic this new administration is very pro-business. So if anything, maybe we will see some things, even from the Inflation Reduction Act or the Section 45V, where maybe they'll say the three pillars actually didn't make any sense. Maybe they'll get rid of that. Right. And I think if anything, given the importance of hydrogen and the role it can play without thinking about or color coding of the hydrogen from green, pink, blue, clean hydrogen has a role to play. And if anything, right, it might be a controversial point to make. But this new administration's pro-business attitude might actually end up playing out in favor of the hydrogen industry and not the other way around. We talked about a lot of hurdles today. So let's also let's maybe wrap up on what you're most optimistic about after. Tell me what you think your biggest challenge is this year. Look, I think there's a lot of noise out there. Right. And that noise can create unnecessary confusion on a short term basis. And, you know, so I think that is not very helpful. And I think it's really probably a bit more of a macro situation. What happens to the overall, you know, are we headed into a recession? Is it a stagflation? Is it an inflationary environment? That, frankly, is not easy to navigate when you really think about it. Right. And that actually plays a very big role in terms of your financial planning. You know, so you have lots of different targets. Right. There is a target that you can accomplish if the world is in a normal environment, if normal is such a word we want to use, you know. So, you know, if there is a lot of chaos and if the trade situation, geopolitical situation becomes more challenging, what does that mean? Right. So the projects that were ready to move, can they get pushed out by six months? Can they get pushed out by three months? Can they actually, can there be some kind of a pause? Right. So this macro noise is obviously a challenge, but I don't think it's a plug specific issue, frankly. Right. I think it's something that we're all navigating through. We're all trying to figure out. But look, at the end of the day, I think we'll all figure out what it looks like. Right. I'm sure we're all hoping that there will be some level of stability here in terms of what the outlook is, what the view is here in not too distant future. So it's really the macro uncertainty is something I think is a challenge, not just for plug, but for everybody. Right. That can impact so many things, including, as you just pointed out, investor appetite, access to capital, cost of capital, all those things. Right. But look, that's why we believe we've taken that into consideration and been thoughtful about how we're thinking about our financial outlook for 2025. Excellent.
