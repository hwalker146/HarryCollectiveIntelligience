### Why It’s Taken Until Now for the U.S.’s First Coast-to-Coast Rail Operator

A mega-merger creates America's first coast-to-coast rail operator. Plus, why utilities and technology companies are at odds over who should pay for the electricity costs in the unprecedented data center build-out. Utilities have, for a long time, been increasing rates to make the investments needed to stabilize the grid at this time. And in some places, the sheer amount of demand coming from data centers specifically adds another layer of stress. And how one of the biggest credit card deals ever could bring JPMorgan Chase and Apple together. It's Tuesday, July 29th. I'm Alex Zosola for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Union Pacific has agreed to acquire Norfolk Southern in a $71.5 billion deal, which would create the first company to control coast-to-coast rail shipments, joining 50,000 miles of railroad tracks that span from the Jersey Shore to the ports in California. The union would create a single company controlling coast-to-coast rail shipments for the first time in U.S. history. The deal still requires regulatory approval from the Surface Transportation Board. Esther Fung covers transportation companies for the journal and joins me now. Esther, why did we not have a coast-to-coast railway operator before? The reason why we don't have one single coast-to-coast rail operator before is largely due to regulators. In the past, when there were mergers between major railroads, there were lots of traffic snarls and service disruptions that occurred because some of these railroad executives admitted that they were overconfident in their ability to combine networks that had hundreds of thousands of freight rail cars. And the resulting service meltdown spooked shippers and made regulators very wary of approving such mergers again. So when big railways in the past have merged, what kinds of issues have resulted? When these major railways had merged, some of the big problems that have occurred was they laid off too many people at once and in key positions, but then they realized there were some issues and the right person to resolve these is no longer there. And then the bottlenecks happen. That is something the regulators do not want to see again. And Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern took pains this morning during the announcement and investor call to say that the networks are running well. They took pains to say that they will have a buffer of staff, locomotives and other resources to manage this transition. The truth is we don't know until it happens. Are we likely to see more consolidation within the transportation industry? Analysts expect further consolidation because this single line railroad would have competitive advantages that the other two, BNSF and CSX, would struggle with. So it's about maintaining their competitive edge. That was WSJ reporter Esther Fung. Thanks so much, Esther. Thank you. It's been a pleasure. The International Monetary Fund said today that the road ahead for the global economy has turned brighter this summer. The risks from the trade war remain. The U.S. and China saw some of the most significant upward forecast revisions, largely in recognition of a tariff truce the two countries reached in June. The IMF projected that the U.S. will also get a boost from the budget deal President Donald Trump signed earlier this month, with the biggest benefit flowing from better incentives for corporate investment. The Commerce Department's report on second-quarter U.S. growth is due tomorrow. Meanwhile, American consumers' economic mood improved this month, but remained clouded by concerns about tariffs and the labor market. That's according to the Conference Board, a research group that runs a monthly survey. The group said today that its Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 97.2 from 95.2 in June. About 30 percent of consumers said jobs are plentiful, up from June. But the number who said jobs are hard to get grew more, rising to 19 percent from 17 percent a month earlier. Major U.S. indexes were down today. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, ending its streak of record highs. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4 percent from yesterday's record, while the Dow dropped half a percent, or 205 points. We're exclusively reporting that JPMorgan Chase is in advanced talks to take over Apple's credit card program. That's according to people familiar with the matter. Discussions between the country's biggest bank and Apple accelerated in recent months, with Apple telling JPMorgan it is the tech giant's preferred choice to replace Goldman Sachs as its card partner. Still, the deal hasn't been signed, and there are chances that talks could unravel because of a number of challenges associated with the Apple program. For more, I'm joined by WSJ banking reporter Anna Maria Andriotis. Anna Maria, what would be the significance of this deal? We're talking about one of the most popular credit cards that's attached to one of the largest tech companies in the world, and that could potentially go to the biggest bank in the U.S. So we're talking about a program that's very popular, and the companies tied to it, or vying to be tied to it, are among the largest and, quite frankly, the most powerful from the tech and financial side. What would this mean for Goldman? If this program actually finally does move, this would be the final step in Goldman's exit from consumer lending. Goldman several years ago entered into consumer lending with a plan to become big on Main Street. The credit card launch with Apple basically cemented those ambitions of Goldman. That's pretty much all done right now. Goldman has offloaded pretty much everything having to do with lending to consumers, with the exception of Apple and this credit card program. So as we reported, the deal has not yet been signed, and there are chances that it could unravel. But as of now, the two sides have advanced significantly. That was WSJ reporter Anna-Maria Andriotis. Thanks Anna-Maria. Thank you. Shares in Novo Nordisk plunged as much as 30 percent today, at one point wiping out almost $93 billion of the company's market capitalization after the Danish drugmaker said headwinds for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wigovi would cut its sales growth for the year. Novo has lost its lead in the booming market for weight loss drugs, opening the door to competitors such as makers of knockoff versions of Novo's drugs and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. It's the latest in a series of challenges facing the once high-flying company, which also today named a new CEO. Coming up, as artificial intelligence demands a lot more electricity, a debate is raging about who will pay for it. That's after the break. With a major selection of the looks your kiddos love, starting at just $4 in the Walmart app, a new school year means a stylish new them. Who knew? Find skater skirts and Crocs that say, I'm casual but cool. Sparkly sneakers that say, it's my classroom, you're just learning in it. And preppy polos that say, I'm the teacher's pet, even if they're mommy's menace at home. Find their favorite styles starting at just $4 in the app. The Walmart you thought you knew is now new. Technology companies need an extraordinary amount of electricity to power data centers at the core of the artificial intelligence race. Now across the U.S., utilities are asking tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to pay more to connect their new data centers to the power grid. I'm joined now by Katherine Blunt, who covers power and utilities for WSJ. Katherine, why exactly are tech companies being asked to pay more? A number of places around the country, utilities are becoming concerned that the enormous cost of the new infrastructure that they need to build to serve a really significant buildout of data centers could ultimately be borne by regular customers if tech companies don't ultimately need all the electricity that they say that they will. So for example, if a utility spends a billion dollars to build a power line, largely to serve a data center, and the data center packs up and leaves in five years, it's possible that the remaining customers on the system would have to pay for that particular infrastructure. So utilities are asking tech companies to pay more to take on the financial risks that other customers won't have to. So what are tech companies saying about this? To be clear, tech companies aren't saying we don't want to pay our fair share. They say that they do. They say that they're committed to doing that. But in some cases, they say, look, we don't want to have to pay substantially more for this particular upgrade because it also serves other customers, not just us. The grid is a network, right? So if you add more transmission or you add another power plant, it does benefit customers other than the data center. And so basically, they're saying we understand the risks of so-called stranded assets, but we also don't want to take on more risk than necessary. And I'm curious what local communities are saying about this. Like a lot of communities where you see a sudden influx in demand from data centers, concern among regular folks that they ultimately end up subsidizing the build out of this infrastructure, right? Because power costs have been going up substantially in a lot of places for a while now. And the idea of having to pay more for something that they didn't necessarily ask for is not necessarily a palatable idea. That was Wall Street Journal reporter Katherine Blunt. Thanks, Katherine. Thank you. For many years, workers and bosses had an understanding. Entry-level employees work hard for lower pay, while employers provide training and experience to give young professionals a foothold in the job market. WSJ reporter Lindsay Ellis, who covers workplace and careers, told our tech news briefing podcast that now artificial intelligence threatens to completely break that contract, which was already weakened. Some of the sectors that we've been pointed to are information, tech jobs, finance, insurance, technical services. For example, Grindr CEO said that they would rather hire more seasoned engineers instead of junior coders straight out of school. One recruiting firm told me that typically they would have high-volume demand from marketing agencies to hire entry-level staff. That work has totally vanished. One company I talked to, the CEO basically said, typically we bring on a summer intern. For years and years, we've done that, especially for social media. This year, instead of coaching a summer intern, I'm just going to talk into ChatGPT and it's going to clean up the copy and those posts will be ready for airtime. To hear more, listen to today's episode of Tech News Briefing. And finally, the gunman who killed four people in a midtown Manhattan skyscraper yesterday accused the National Football League in a suicide note of concealing the dangers of the sport on players' brains. That's according to a New York Police Department official. Police said that 27-year-old Shane Tamura used an M4 rifle to kill an NYPD police officer in the lobby of the building, as well as a security guard, an executive of financial firm Blackstone, and a real estate firm employee before shooting himself in the chest. Police say Tamura, who lived in Las Vegas and had a history of mental illness, played football in high school. A spokesperson for the NFL referred a request for comment to the NYPD. And that's what's news for this Tuesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bien-Aimé with supervising producer Michael Cosmidis. I'm Alex Ossola for The Wall Street Journal. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening.

### Famine Unfolding in Gaza, Experts Say
**Episode ID:** 2614
**Date:** 2025-07-29 09:54:00+00:00

With a major selection of the looks your kiddos love starting at just $4 in the Walmart app, a new school year means a stylish new them. Who knew? Find skater skirts and Crocs that say, I'm casual but cool. Sparkly sneakers that say, it's my classroom, you're just learning in it. And preppy polos that say, I'm the teacher's pet, even if they're mommy's menace at home. Find their favorite styles starting at just $4 in the app. The Walmart you thought you knew is now new. Food insecurity experts say Gaza is now in a state of famine. Plus a shooting in the heart of New York City leaves a Blackstone executive and several others dead. And how the Trump administration plans to raise $1 trillion in just three months. Treasury Secretary Scott Besson has been very open in talking about this. He calls himself the country's top bond salesman. It's Tuesday, July the 29th. I'm Azhar Soukri for The Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Famine is now unfolding in Gaza. That's the most dire assessment of the enclave's deepening hunger crisis since the start of the war. An interim report released this morning by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, found at least 16 children under five have died of hunger-related causes since mid-July. Journal correspondent Margarita Stancati says it's the first time the UN-supported group has described the food crisis in such terms. Food security experts are saying that all areas of the Gaza Strip are experiencing rapidly deteriorating food insecurity. So when it comes to extreme food shortage, you know, most households are saying that they regularly are not having food to eat of any kind and that often people go to bed hungry. Acute childhood malnutrition is getting much worse across the enclave and particularly in the north, and hunger-related deaths are increasing. So these are the three criteria used to measure famine conditions. And the IPC, in its update, said all three things are getting worse. The situation has become so severe that even President Trump weighed in on it yesterday. He referred to images he's seen on TV and he said, you know, some of those kids, that's real starvation stuff. And his comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, you know, there is no policy of starvation in Gaza and, in fact, there is no starvation in Gaza. Today's assessment is not an official declaration of famine, which happens rarely and is very politically sensitive. It's now up to governments and senior UN officials to declare a famine based on the IPC's assessment. A lone shooter has killed four people, including a police officer and an executive from financial firm Blackstone in a midtown New York building. The gunman then turned the gun on himself. Speaking last night, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tish said the shooter was 27-year-old Shane Temura, who had driven his black BMW across the country from Colorado, double-parked on Park Avenue during the evening rush, and began shooting as soon as he was inside the building lobby. 35 Park Avenue is a commercial office building whose tenants include the NFL, Rudin Management, KPMG and Blackstone. Four innocent victims are dead. Among them is NYPD police officer Deedarul Islam, 36 years old, four years on the job. The NYPD said the alleged shooter had a documented mental health history and that his motives are still under investigation. A fifth person remains in critical condition. We are exclusively reporting that the Trump administration is considering a plan to raise tens of billions of dollars with a new fee that would transform the patent system. That's according to people familiar with the matter. It would be a radical move that would likely get pushback from businesses. The People's said that Commerce Department officials are discussing charging holders 1% to 5% of their patent value, a shift that could dramatically increase fees. A Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment. And in another exclusive, we're reporting that premiums for Medicare drug plans are set to increase sharply next year. That's mostly due to rising costs, regulatory changes and cutbacks to a subsidy programme. That initiative has largely shielded seniors from rising monthly bills in 2025. According to a Medicare official, the subsidy programme pumped an extra $6.2 billion of federal payments into so-called Part D plans this year. The Trump administration is set to cut spending on that programme by about 40% in 2026. Mars, the maker of M&Ms, Skittles and Kind bars, will invest more than $2 billion into US factories over the next 18 months, spanning its snacking, food and pet care businesses. Mars has already invested about $6 billion over the past five years, which it said added 9,000 jobs in the US. The company, one of the world's biggest family-owned and privately-held firms, said that 94% of its products sold in the US are now made in America. And kicking off a busy day for earnings, Spotify said that it added about 12% more premium subscribers in the second quarter, topping its own guidance. The streaming platform expanded access to its audiobooks and personalised music offerings around the world. But the company still swung to a loss of about $100 million amid higher personnel and marketing costs. This morning we'll also get results from UnitedHealth, Merck, Procter & Gamble and Boeing, with Visa and Starbucks reporting after the closing bell. Coming up, Wall Street is bracing for a deluge of Treasury bills as the Trump administration moves to shake things up in the dusty government bond market. But more on that story after the break.

The Trump administration is making government borrowing exciting again, or as some investors might see it, more unpredictable than it has been in decades. Enormous tax and spending plans mean the administration is having to issue a load of short-term bonds to finance its deficit. Sam Goldfarb has written extensively about the U.S. debt market. Sam, we learned yesterday that the Treasury expects to borrow more than a trillion dollars this coming quarter. That's a huge leap from previous estimates. How did we get here? Yeah, so basically the U.S. government has a fairly large gap between the revenue that's taking in in taxes and the money that it's spending on everything from Medicare to defense. And this predated this latest Trump administration, but he's extended tax cuts that he passed in his first administration, and that's sort of like locked in this fiscal trajectory, which just means that the government has to borrow a lot of money to make sure that it can meet its spending obligations. Yeah, so clearly a lot of debt is about to come to the market to finance that big, beautiful bill. Is the Trump administration doing anything to shore up support among investors? Yeah, so it's kind of interesting. In the past, presidents and Treasury secretaries have really not waded too much into this issue about exactly how they're going to borrow. But Treasury Secretary Scott Besant has been very open in talking about this. He calls himself the country's top bond salesman. And Trump himself has said, we're going to go very short term, wait for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to have his term expire, and then we're going to get rates way down, and then we're going to go long term. And that kind of talk is just unusual because in the past, administrations felt like that we should just basically not talk about this, sort of have investors not think about it, and then just come up with a mix of debt that could kind of last for the long term. Right. And the administration is due to provide a formal update about its borrowing plans tomorrow. That's usually a fairly run-of-the-mill announcement. But investors seem to be watching more closely as to which bonds are being issued. Am I right? So basically, the base case is that nothing will change, that they'll just keep issuing notes and bonds that mature two years to 30 years at the same pace as they've been doing. Now that suggests, in some ways it sounds like, okay, so nothing's changing. But if they just continue to do that, as the borrowing needs grow, that means that they'll have to do the additional borrowing with short-term debt, with bills that mature in a year or less. So just maintaining the status quo, in some ways, over time, will amount to a policy change. Because if you just are issuing the same amount of, let's say, 10-year notes, but the borrowing needs are getting bigger, you have to issue more short-term debt. And with the Fed's latest rate decision due tomorrow, there will be a lot to sift through, not least any indications of when a rate cut could be expected that might send the interest and all that debt down. Sam Goldfarb is a Journal Markets reporter. Thank you so much, Sam. Thank you. And that's it for What's News for this Tuesday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bark and Kate Bullivant.

### What to Make of the U.S.-EU Deal That Averted Trade War
**Episode ID:** 2570
**Date:** 2025-07-28 21:02:00+00:00

This episode is brought to you by Charles Schwab. Decisions made in Washington can affect your portfolio every day. Washington Wise from Charles Schwab is an original podcast that unpacks the stories making news there. Listen at Schwab.com slash Washington Wise. The US-EU trade deal averts a potential trade war as President Trump seems set on tariffs. It goes to show that Trump has zero intention on removing these tariffs entirely, that they're going to be part of his negotiating strategy. And it's a real clear signal for other countries coming to the table, they're not going to do away with these tariffs one way or another. The deal marks a victory for Trump but faces pushback in Europe. And why companies are touting workforce reductions to Wall Street. It's Monday, July 28th. I'm Sabrina Siddiqi for The Wall Street Journal, covering for Alex Ossola. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic breathe a sigh of relief that the US and European Union have averted a bruising trade war with their agreement on tariffs and investment. Now attention is shifting to assessing the deal's winners and losers. The deal would impose a 15% baseline tariff on most European goods, while the EU has also agreed to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of US energy products and invest in the US. Brian Schwartz, The Wall Street Journal's White House economic policy reporter joins me to discuss. Brian, this is the most consequential agreement Trump has announced thus far. How did we arrive at this deal? Well, this was weeks in the making. There was a letter that was sent out by President Trump recently, basically saying that the EU was set to pay a 30% tariff. But then things quickly changed when the president decided to meet with the leaders of the EU in Scotland. That ratcheted things up very, very quickly, and it led to the deal that was announced. And his presence, according to everybody we talked to, really did make the difference to push this thing over the finish line over the last few days. What does this agreement mean for the US? Well, frankly, the deal seems to give more of a benefit to the United States than it does to the European Union. We're talking about the European Union guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars in investments into the United States. That's a big deal. I don't remember a trade deal featuring the European Union that had those types of details. And on the other hand, the 15% tariff, although less than the 30% that the president originally said he would put on the European Union, is significant because it goes to show that Trump has zero intention on removing these tariffs entirely, that they're going to be part of his negotiating strategy. It's a real clear signal for other countries coming to the table, they're not going to do away with these tariffs one way or another. And what has the reaction been like here at home? The stock market overall has been pretty happy about this. The White House has, of course, been pushing out how big of a deal this is. Listen, this was one of his wills for the president and his team. And in the end, they managed to get this done. How has the deal been received in Europe? When I read things from expert analysts on this stuff, a lot of people think it really isn't a great deal for the European Union, that they gave a lot of way in order to avoid the president's wrath. A lot of analysts think that the EU gave away kind of the barn here a little bit. That's the thinking out of fear that the president was going to unleash the tariff juggernaut on them. So the deal has been agreed to in principle. What are the next steps? Just like any other trade deal, it's not going to be something that happens automatically. You know, these are hundreds of billions of dollars of investments over the time span of a couple of years. So you're not going to see something jump out in the next week where you're going to see this company come out and immediately be able to build a plant somewhere in the United States. But if it pans out the way the president wants it to pan out, that is going to be pretty significant for potential job growth here in the United States. Brian Schwartz is a White House economic policy reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Brian, thank you. Thank you. Following President Trump's trade deal with the European Union, the euro sank against the dollar. In U.S. markets, the Nasdaq edged 0.3 percent higher, while the Dow Industrial slipped 0.1 percent and the S&P 500 wavered. A majority of Americans support President Trump's goal of cracking down on illegal immigration, but they say his approach has gone too far. That's according to a new Wall Street Journal poll, which found that just over half of voters approve of Trump's handling of illegal immigration, a centerpiece of his agenda. 62 percent of respondents favored deporting people who came to the country illegally. But 58 percent of voters opposed two steps under Trump's mass deportation push. The first is detaining and deporting people believed to be in the U.S. illegally without them seeing a judge or getting a hearing. The second is deporting immigrants to prisons in other countries, such as El Salvador and South Sudan, where they have no personal connections. Speaking in Scotland today, President Trump said he would shorten the deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine or face more economic pressure from the U.S. I'm going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today. No reason to wait. There's no reason to wait. It's 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don't see any progress being made. Earlier this month, Trump had given Putin 50 days to agree to a peace deal or threaten that the U.S. would unleash a tariff package on Russia's trading partners. Today, Trump voiced frustration with Russian attacks on Ukraine intensifying despite what he thought were positive talks with Putin. It was not exactly clear what actions Russia would face if it didn't end the fighting by mid-August. The president also said the U.S. and Europe would launch a program to deliver food directly to Palestinians in Gaza as a deadly hunger crisis grips the territory. Speaking in Scotland with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump described the food crisis in Gaza as a terrible situation. The initiative's details are unclear, with questions arising over whether it is a new effort or an expansion of an existing Israeli-backed program. A White House spokeswoman said further details of the plan would be forthcoming. Trump's announcement comes amid growing pressure over Gaza's food crisis, which has rapidly deteriorated in recent weeks. The United Nations says thousands of children are being treated for malnutrition. Its medical partners have reported that more than a dozen children have starved to death this month alone. Coming up, CEOs are shrinking their workforces and they couldn't be prouder. That's after the break. How businesses connect with customers defines their brand. Sierra is the AI platform for building better, more human customer experiences. Fast answers. No canned responses. No hold music. No frustration. Visit Sierra.ai to learn more. Big companies are getting smaller and their CEOs want everyone to know it. Gone are the days when trimming headcount was a sign of trouble. Companies are openly touting workforce reductions to Wall Street, marking a shift from more careful language in the past. Smaller workforces, influenced by startups and the use of AI, are now viewed by many executives as an asset. For more, I'm joined by Wall Street Journal reporter Chip Cutter. Chip, what is behind the shift in how corporations are talking about staff reductions? Part of it is a cooling labor market and this desire among many large companies to really embrace AI and to wring costs out in the process. So we've gone from a point where CEOs used to talk about employees as the talent, as their greatest assets, to now many CEOs thinking that these employees are almost an impediment, that large teams might be holding them back from progress. And so we've seen a really dramatic swing now in the ways that companies are talking about this. They're almost bragging about the ways that they're able to cut headcount. Just to give you a little flavor for what we're seeing out there. The CEO of Wells Fargo recently said that the bank had been able to cut headcount for 20 consecutive quarters. He said that the bank was using attrition, quote, as our friend. The CEO of Verizon, meanwhile, boasted to investors that the company had been, quote, very, very good on headcount. He noted that it's going down all the time. We're expecting the latest monthly jobs report on Friday. What does this smaller workforce trend tell us about the labor market? I think it just shows that we are at this moment where companies are thinking really critically about whether to add white collar jobs or not. This is all affecting the corporate positions, the higher paid, knowledge-based jobs that are out there. And so what companies are doing is they're starting to blur roles, they're keeping jobs unfilled, they're holding back on hiring. So it's not that we're typically seeing large scale layoffs yet, but it's companies sort of really evaluating whether they need to add jobs to grow going forward. We've heard, for example, companies talk about a product manager being blended with that of a software engineer. There's been other examples of that, of companies saying, we're going to use more technology to then ensure that we no longer need to add headcount in this area. Perhaps it gets redeployed elsewhere, or perhaps we just don't fill those positions. Chip Cutter is a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Thank you, Chip. Thank you. The latest food trend to take over TikTok feeds and convenience store treat aisles? Dubai chocolate, a confection that typically involves a shell of rich chocolate filled with pistachio cream and a shredded dough known as kataifi. Some of the biggest food companies in America are picking up on it while considering whether the Dubai chocolate flavor might endure as a future classic, like a pumpkin spice or salted caramel. My colleague Alex Osela spoke with WSJ reporter Owen Tucker-Smith and asked him about the challenges these companies are facing as they are looking to incorporate Dubai chocolate into their products. So the list of ingredients in Dubai chocolate happened to be difficult to procure. Chocolate has already been a problem because cocoa prices are remaining so, so high. And so chocolate has actually been a product that plenty of food companies have been backing away from recently. Pistachios are also a traditionally expensive nut. And some companies have even been skeptical about including more pistachio desserts because it hasn't always traditionally sold well. And then the kataifi is a lesser known product in the U.S. and you will all of a sudden have all these companies from across the world trying to get a hold of it at the same time. And when those things happen, there's a supply chain bottleneck. Prices go up, supply goes down. And it means that you have to really deploy a lot of resources in your company to make it happen at an affordable level, at a high quality level, and in the short timeframe required to get it out while this is still a hot trend. Given these challenges, is this likely to become a long-term staple in terms of flavor profile? That is the question for all these food companies these days, is there's a new TikTok trend every week that's hyping up a new flavor profile, a new food, and oftentimes you don't want to chase those because by the time you get the resources together, it's already over. And one of the examples we say in the story is whipped coffee, which for a moment during COVID felt like it was all the rage. But if you had pivoted your business model to chase something like that, now it wouldn't be good for you. But at the same time, another trend is that we're seeing a faster emergence of long-term flavor profiles, meaning that there are trends that might look like a fad at the moment, but are actually very quickly becoming competitors to some of the staples like salted caramel. And so that's the bet that these companies are making, but you'll never know if it's going to be a long-term thing until it stands the test of time. That was WSJ reporter Owen Tucker-Smith speaking with Alex Osela. And that's what's news for this Monday afternoon, additional audio in today's episode courtesy of Reuters. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bien-Aimé with supervising producer Michael Kosmidis. I'm Sabrina Siddiqi for The Wall Street Journal. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.

### U.S., EU Strike Biggest Trade Deal So Far
**Episode ID:** 2571
**Date:** 2025-07-28 10:16:00+00:00

How businesses connect with customers defines their brand. Sierra is the AI platform for building better, more human customer experiences. Fast answers, no canned responses, no hold music, no frustration. Visit sierra.ai to learn more. The US and European Union reach a landmark trade agreement. It delivers stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Plus, Samsung and Tesla agree to a multi-billion dollar chip supply deal. And Israel pauses military activity in Gaza to allow in humanitarian aid. It's Monday, July the 28th. I'm Azhar Soukry for the Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Uncertainty in uncertain times. That's how European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement the world's two biggest trade partners reached yesterday. It is the largest deal President Trump has announced so far as he tries to remake the global trading system. We are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15 percent. In return, the EU has agreed to buy US energy products and invest $600 billion in the US. Our Brussels reporter Kim McRael has been following the talks. Kim, explain to us what has been agreed and just how consequential this deal is. So I think the basic framework for this idea, and I have to mention, we don't have anything in writing at this point. So really all of what we understand about what was agreed to is based on what the two leaders, President Trump and the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen, said last night. So they both say that we're looking at a 15 percent tariff on most European goods that are exported to the US. Crucially for the EU, that includes autos, that includes the automotive sector, which is something that the Europeans were very concerned about, especially because of the German car industry, which is currently facing the 25 percent tariff that Trump issued for the world. And what's really important about this is that the EU is the biggest regional trading partner of the United States. So the bloc has 27 member states. They all have a common trade policy. And when you take them together, they are the US's biggest trading partner and the biggest source of foreign investment to the US. So when you think about it on a daily basis, the two sides exchange more than $5 billion worth of goods and services each day. So what are the US and the EU getting out of this? From the EU side, they have sort of agreed to cementing quite high tariffs, much higher than ever before. So previously, tariffs for European goods exported to the US were less than 5 percent on average. We're looking at a jump to 15 percent for most goods. So it's a huge shift and something that is expected to have a negative impact on the European economy. On the other hand, moving to a point where businesses have a sense of what level they should expect gives the kind of stability that a lot of European business leaders and business groups have been saying they really could use to try to plan for the future. On the American side, it reinforces Trump's interest in having baseline tariffs that are quite high compared to previous years. He hopes that that could allow for some reshoring of industry in the US. The other thing that the US can get from this is the pledges that the EU made in terms of additional investments in the US, as well as pledges to purchase more from the US, especially on energy, liquefied natural gas, I think is something that we'll probably see when the details of the agreement come out. We'll probably see a big focus on that. How does this trade deal then compare with some of the other deals that Trump has been reaching, especially ahead of the August deadline as he tries to remake the global trading system? Yeah, so what we see with the general outline of this deal is that it looks quite similar to the agreement that was announced with Japan last week. So both of them got the 15 baseline tariff, both had it applied to the automotive industry as well. And I think what that tells us is that we're starting to see 15% shake out as the likely level of minimum tariffs on most major US trading partners. So it is true that the UK, which did a deal earlier on, did get a 10% level. At this point, it looks like most others are likely to see 15% or higher. It puts some pressure on other countries that don't have a deal yet. And I'm thinking, for example, of South Korea, to try to get something similar, because the situation you may have now is those that have a 15% tariff, or in the UK's case, a 10% tariff, they may end up having a competitive advantage over other trading partners that, for example, are facing those 25% tariffs on cars that Trump put into place. Wall Street Journal, Brussels reporter Kim McRyle, thank you so much for your insights. Thanks so much for having me. And Trump will continue his trade efforts when he sits down with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer today to iron out final details of the UK agreement. US and Chinese officials are also set to meet in Stockholm today and tomorrow to discuss extending their trade truce beyond the current August 12th expiration. Turning to Gaza now, where Israel has announced a tactical pause in military activity to allow for safe routes for humanitarian aid as deadly malnutrition spreads across the enclave. The announcement follows growing pressure from Arab and Western officials over what residents and humanitarian workers say is the worst hunger crisis in Gaza since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. The World Food Programme, or WFP, said yesterday that it welcomes Israel's commitment to humanitarian pauses and corridors and hoped new measures would improve conditions on the ground. However, the WFP's country director for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Antoine Renard, says this shouldn't be a one-off. This is long overdue and we need still to reiterate how important is the ceasefire. So now we see this as a proper way for us to increase the assistance into Gaza, but it will not be within, you know, one single day that we can actually change the current level of salvation that you have currently in Gaza. In a sign of how desperate the situation has become, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan resumed airdrops of aid overnight and this morning, parachuting loads including flour, sugar and canned food into the enclave. Coming up, a major win for Samsung as it signs a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture semiconductors for Tesla. And in the face of rising temperatures, Europe is taking notes from the US on air conditioning. That and more after the break. Samsung Electronics will make chips for Tesla in a $16.5 billion multi-year deal, marking a major win for its foundry business. In a post on X, Tesla boss Elon Musk said Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to making the EV maker's next-generation AI6 chip. The Journal's Korea Bureau Chief Tim Martin says the deal is crucial for Samsung and comes at a particularly sensitive time for the US and South Korea, who are yet to hash out a trade agreement. This is one of the largest chip deals we've ever seen. This represents 7% of its overall revenue and that includes Samsung's divisions with smartphones and televisions and appliances. This is just a massive amount of money, but it comes at a very vulnerable moment. These chips will be made at its new facilities in Texas. And appeasing America, helping the US revive its semiconductor industry is a core concern for Samsung and many global companies. There is a big push that started under President Biden and now certainly is the case under President Trump that foreign companies need to do more of their business and core technologies in the US and perhaps no industry is more vital than semiconductors. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison says it's in talks with a BlackRock-led consortium to include a strategic investor from China as part of its plans to sell ports on either end of the Panama Canal. CK Hutchison didn't identify the Chinese company. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that China was pushing for state-owned Costco to be an equal partner and shareholder of the ports. This, as earlier moves to put the ports into US ownership reportedly angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping. President Trump has identified the ports as a security concern due to their Chinese connections. And Citigroup is launching a new premium credit card aimed at frequent travellers. It's the latest salvo in a high-stakes war among banks to win over affluent customers. With a $595 annual fee, the Strata Elite card is Citi's answer to JP Morgan Chase's Sapphire Reserve and American Express' Platinum cards, which offer a bevy of rewards but charge higher fees. And seeing as we started the show with a major transatlantic deal, we thought we'd end on another important change of heart, bringing Europe closer to the US. Because it seems that searing summer heatwaves may be softening Europeans' long-standing resistance to air conditioning. And that's kicked off a new political fight about the wisdom of installing the technology everywhere, as climate change reporter Matthew Dalton reports. This year what happened was that the heatwave came particularly early. At the end of June, beginning of July, before people had a chance to get out of the cities and go on their extended European vacations, people were really feeling the heat. So that prompted a lot of criticism, generally from the right, from politicians in France and the UK and Spain, where the heatwave was particularly ferocious. There are two sides to this. There's one side where if it gets too hot, people can die. The flip side of that is that a lot of Europeans don't like air conditioning that much. They don't like the feeling of being in an air-conditioned room for extended periods of time. And then I think a lot of Europeans are concerned about the energy usage from air conditioning. And there are also some industries that depend on cooling to keep their products good. You know, I mentioned in my story a vineyard that air-conditions its wine vats to keep them from turning to vinegar. So there are some cases where air conditioning really is a necessity. And that's it for What's News for this Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bach and Kate Boulivant. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhoff.

### Is the U.S. Ready for a Nuclear Energy Boom?
**Episode ID:** 2572
**Date:** 2025-07-27 10:00:00+00:00

This episode is brought to you by Charles Schwab. Decisions made in Washington can affect your portfolio every day. Washington Wise from Charles Schwab is an original podcast that unpacks the stories making news there. Listen at schwab.com slash washingtonwise. Hey What's News listeners. It's Sunday, July 27th. I'm Alex Osala for The Wall Street Journal. This is What's New Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news by reaching out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. On today's show, startups are aiming for an audacious reboot of America's nuclear energy program. The sector is receiving unprecedented private support and enthusiasm from the Trump administration. Could the U.S. be seeing the dawn of a new nuclear age? We'll get into what this would look like and what it would take to get there. U.S. electricity consumption reached an all-time high last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And as A.I. continues to take off, that demand is only expected to grow. Recent executive orders from President Trump aim to quadruple nuclear power generation in the next 25 years. It's a challenging prospect. For many Americans, memories of meltdowns like Three Mile Island in 1979 and Fukushima in 2011 still linger. Due to factors like competition from cheaper energy sources, the number of new nuclear plants in the U.S. has declined since the 1990s. And traditional nuclear plants can cost tens of billions of dollars to build. Enter small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs. Though designs vary, these small reactors can be built in factories at lower costs than a whole new plant, and shipped to where they're needed. But questions remain, like what it will take to make them cost-effective, and whether they will be enough to meet America's energy needs. To talk about this, I'm joined by Clay Sell, CEO of Xenergy, an SMR reactor and fuel developer, and WSJ Renewable Energy reporter Jennifer Hiller. Jennifer, let's get a sense of where we're at now. How is nuclear power different today than, say, the 70s? In some ways, it's kind of like the 70s still. We have a lot of large reactors, and that's what was being built in the 70s and 80s. But there is just a lot more talk right now than what seems to be action beginning, where we're looking at what could be maybe a next era of construction, where we might see a variety of kinds of reactors built. And Clay, how are reactors different now on a technical level? The technology is not the same. Fission is the same. The fissioning process is the same. But the reactors that are emerging today, including the technology we're developing at my company, Xenergy, is very different. These are reactors that are intrinsically safe. In the case of our reactor, it cannot melt down. So when you think about what happened at Three Mile Island or what happened at Chernobyl, we have developed a technology where it's physically impossible for that to happen. So these are very different machines that we're bringing to the marketplace and that we'll be bringing online in the early 2030s. Jennifer, what do we know about the safety record of these designs? Some of the designs are meltdown proof, and the regulators are the ones that will approve those designs. And some of the SMRs are going the path of doing sort of a smaller version of our existing reactors. So those would maybe have the potential, but we haven't had a lot of accidents in the U.S., and so there's a fairly good safety record. It seems like nuclear is having a bit of a moment right now. What has changed to enable this? A few things have changed. If you look at maybe 10 or 15 years ago, people were talking about building a lot of reactors, and that didn't end up happening, basically for market reasons. Today there's a lot of new designs, there's a lot of tax policy support, there's a lot of government support for trying to start some new projects. So that's new, and you really need some level of government support to get things off the ground essentially in this industry. And on top of that, I think one of the things that looks fundamentally different this year versus even just two years ago is that you have a customer, and that you have a customer in the tech industry potentially that is willing to help bear some of the capital risk of trying a new project. There's a lot of state interest in doing these projects, but you have an off-taker customer that is willing, in some cases, to put some money on the table. Clay, I'm curious, which of the factors that Jennifer just talked about are making the biggest difference for your company? It is really the tremendous increase in demand for electricity that is largely and most popularly being driven by the hyperscalers and the big data center operators that have to operate 24-7. And most of the new growth in generation in the United States over the last 20 years has been in wind and solar, but they are not 24-7. And it just so happens that in the last five or 10 years, nuclear power has scourged in popularity. Last March, Gallup released a poll showing that 61% of Americans favor the use of expanded nuclear energy. And so nuclear is popular. The need for 24-7 clean power is clearly evident. Political support from both Republicans and Democrats has materialized in a very aggressive set of policies to promote the industry. And all of those things have come together to create a very different environment for nuclear power in 2025. Coming up, what would it take to make this nuclear future a reality? We talk through the obstacles and the possibilities after the break. Schwab Trading is now powered by Ameritrade to give you a new, elevated trading experience tailor-made for trader minds.

Public opinion on nuclear power in the U.S. has become rosier in the past few years, but there's still some wariness. Clay, what are you hearing about how communities are thinking about safety and the possibility of nuclear accidents? There's a generational change that is happening. People that are older than me, and I'm 58, they kind of have a very old and I would argue stale view of nuclear power from the last generation. They're children of the Cold War, they saw the China syndrome, they have views. But the younger generation, 50 and below, have a very different view. They have concerns about the health of the globe, they have concerns about climate change, they recognize that nuclear is a very safe form that makes no air emissions, and they also recognize that no technology is a 100% solution. Everything has pluses and minuses, but when you electrify things, you need more and more electricity. And if it's coming from a coal plant that is belching carbon emissions and soot into the air versus nuclear power, which by independent data is the safest form of generation that has ever been deployed at scale. Jennifer, I'm curious what you make of this. A big portion of the people who are supporters of nuclear energy just are looking at how much wind and solar and battery can you add, and that you need some sort of baseload resource to complement all of that. And people landed on nuclear as this large existing asset. It's a backbone to the grid, essentially, it provides this stable resource. And I think just the further away in time that you get from something like Three Mile Island in the US, opinions change a little bit. And I think these are probably not going to go into communities that don't want them. Generally, places that have nuclear plants like their nuclear plants, and would probably not be opposed to adding another reactor or adding some SMRs. That said, there's always going to be some level of opposition to any projects and people who are concerned about the potential for an accident or just what happens to the waste. I don't think that you're not going to have any opposition at all. There's going to be that for almost any kind of energy project, including this kind. Jennifer, is the grid actually able to handle the amount of power that we're talking about here? Yeah, there's a big debate about that going on. Because when you look at the demand projections, they're pretty startling. And they would imply that we need to build a lot more of the wires and poles kind of transmission infrastructure to move power around, and also a lot of new generation. And if the demand projections are anything in the neighborhood of what is being forecast, you're going to have to build out the grid more. And then you also have kind of an aging grid. And so a lot of equipment is also needing to be just replaced and repaired. Fundamentally, the grid will just have to handle it, but it can be a slow process in some places. And so you are already seeing instances where potential customers are being told in different parts of the country, we cannot connect you for electric service for five years, six years, seven years. There's an interesting opportunity with the grid as it relates to nuclear power. A lot of the transmission that's been built in the United States, as difficult as it is to do, has been built to move wind power from places that people generally don't live to the load centers where they do live. And the great thing about nuclear power is the geographic flexibility to side it relatively close to the load. So for example, the first project that we're building, we're building for Dow Chemical. It is literally behind the meter at their plant in Cedric, Texas. So tell me about Xenergy's plans beyond the one that you just mentioned to scale, to have reactors across the U.S. I understand that there aren't currently any, right? You're right. This new generation of reactors are in development. In some places we've begun construction, but none of them are operating today. And they won't come into operation until the early 2030s. Last year, Xenergy announced a major collaboration with Amazon, and we agreed to work together to deploy up to 5 gigawatts, 5,000 megawatts of power for them in the next 15 years. We are working on a plan to build up to 12 units at a site in Washington State. That project has already begun in collaboration with Utility Energy Northwest. Amazon is putting hundreds of millions of dollars of the project capital into that project to make it happen. And that news was a major game changer in our industry. President Trump's recent executive orders aim to quadruple nuclear power generation in the next 25 years. What will it take to hit those targets that he's laid out? So number one, we have to get started. The industry has to get moving immediately. Number two, we have to recognize that it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital. And so the programs in place that the government is providing, loan guarantees, tax support, these first-of-a-kind programs for the nuclear sector, those are very important to reduce the capital risk. And the third thing we have to do is we have to rebuild our supply chain enterprise to build nuclear power plants. We largely got out of the business of building nuclear power plants in the United States. So that's a generation of workers that have gone away. It's plants, it's suppliers of nuclear equipment that have shut down. All of that has to be built back. That was Xenergy CEO Clay Sell and WSJ reporter Jennifer Hiller. Thank you both so much. Alex, Jennifer, great being with you. Thank you. And that's what's new Sunday for July 27th. Today's show was produced by Charlotte Gartenberg with supervising producer Michael Kosmedes and deputy editor Chris Zinsley. I'm Alex Ozola, and we'll be back tomorrow morning with a brand new show. Until then, thanks for listening.

### What’s News in Markets: Meme Stock Frenzy, Chipotle Stumbles, Toyota Rises
**Episode ID:** 2573
**Date:** 2025-07-26 10:00:00+00:00

How businesses connect with customers defines their brand. Sierra is the AI platform for building better, more human customer experiences. Fast answers, no canned responses, no hold music, no frustration. Visit sierra.ai to learn more. Hey, listeners. It's Saturday, July 26th. I'm Francesca Fontana for The Wall Street Journal, and this is What's News in Markets, our look at the biggest stock moves of the week and the news that drove them. Let's get to it. Earnings and meme stocks. That is what comes to my mind when I think about this past week, as investors digested a slate of quarterly reports from tech giants, airlines, restaurants, and more. And yes, you heard me right. The market has fully debuted meme stock season two. The first season, I'm sure you'll recall, being the frenzy that surrounded stocks such as GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond. So what stocks are getting memefied this time around? Well, I'm going to leave you in suspense for a few minutes. First, let's zoom out. How'd the indexes do? Well, this week started strong, with Verizon's earnings helping boost the S&P 500 to a new high on Monday, and the index just kept on rallying. On Friday, the S&P notched its 14th record close of 2025, and the Nasdaq notched its 15th. And on a weekly basis, the Dow rose 1.3%, the S&P rose 1.5%, and the Nasdaq rose 1%. All right, where was I? Meme stocks. You guys, the Redditors are so back. This time around, they have dialed in on stocks like retailer Kohl's, donut chain Krispy Kreme, and online house flipper Opendoor. Some of them may seem a little goofy, but they all have some common ground, right? Meme traders are seeking out the cheap, beaten down, heavily shorted stocks. And just like we saw last time, we saw some big jumps this week. Let's see. Kohl's on Tuesday more than doubled at the open and then closed 38% higher. And Opendoor's also been on a tear, and its shares jumped 43% that day. And the craze just continued into Wednesday. GoPro, you know, the company that makes those cool cameras and stuff, its shares jumped 57%. And Krispy Kreme rose 20%. Of course, with this kind of volatility, it's not surprising to see some pulling back and pushing forward the rest of the week. But on a weekly basis, Kohl's still gained 34% and Krispy Kreme gained 41%. Earnings season has been pretty strong so far. But two companies that disappointed are Tesla and Chipotle Mexican Grill. So we're talking electric cars and burrito bowls. Elon Musk's EVmaker posted earnings late Wednesday, and its sales sure could use a jump start. It posted a 12% drop in quarterly revenue and an even steeper fall in net income. And the next day, we saw Tesla shares fall 8.2%, and on the week, the stock fell 4.1%. Then there was Chipotle. Now, as we know, people are tightening their purse strings and we're seeing restaurant demand pulling back. But usually, Chipotle's customer base is steady since many of its fans tend to have more disposable income and will still swing by for chips and queso and all that, even as menu prices go up. Not this quarter, though. On Wednesday, the company posted its steepest quarterly drop in same-store sales since the 2020 slowdown in restaurant demand. And that took a sizable bite out of its share price. On Thursday, Chipotle shares dropped 13.3%, and for the week, the stock dropped, oh wow, that's neat, 13.3%. Now, it wouldn't be What's News in Markets 2025 if I didn't talk about the trade war, right? Yes, that's what I thought, too. So let's talk about Toyota, the Japanese carmaker whose U.S.-traded shares jumped on Tuesday's trade deal between the U.S. and Japan. Fun fact, Japan is the third-largest auto exporter to the U.S. after Mexico and South Korea. Under the deal, President Trump said on social media that he'd set his so-called reciprocal tariffs at 15% for the country and that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. And so, U.S.-traded shares of Toyota jumped 14% on Wednesday, and on a weekly basis, they gained roughly 12%. And now you know What's News in Markets this week. You can read about more stocks that moved on the week's news in The Score, my column in the Wall Street Journal's Exchange section. Today's show was produced by Zoe Kolkin with supervising producer Talia Arbel. I'm Francesca Fontana. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you next Saturday.

### Corporate America Is Picking Up the Tab for Trump’s Tariffs
**Episode ID:** 2574
**Date:** 2025-07-25 20:48:00+00:00

How businesses connect with customers defines their brand. Sierra is the AI platform for building better, more human customer experiences. Fast answers, no canned responses, no hold music, no frustration. Visit sierra.ai to learn more. American corporations are footing the bill for Trump's tariffs, as hopes rise for a trade deal between the U.S. and Europe. Plus, banks are getting pickier about who they want to hold their credit cards. It shows that banks are cautious. The economy continues to be really, really strong, but there are some concerns. So they are hedging a bit by focusing on customers that they see as safer. And how the Trump administration is looking to strike deals with universities like it did with Colombia. It's Friday, July 25th. I'm Alex Zosola for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. The U.S. has collected an additional $55 billion in tariffs this year. So far, corporate America has largely shouldered the bill. Now, who's making that first payment isn't much of a mystery. Tariffs are typically paid by importers when goods reach U.S. ports, so it's usually a manufacturer, a logistics or a customs broker, or a retailer that ordered the shipment. But economists and others have been watching for signs of who will ultimately bear the cost. For more, I'm joined by Wall Street Journal economics reporter, Jean Whalen. Jean, what is the strategy for businesses to be shouldering this cost right now? Well, businesses, so far, they're paying the higher tariffs when goods arrive at port or when they buy the goods from some other company that has imported them. And the strategy is mostly they don't really know how long these tariffs are sticking around, and so they don't really want to go through the hassle of raising their prices before they're sure that the tariffs are permanent. They also don't want to raise prices quickly if their competitors are not doing it yet, so they don't want to get out of step with the competition. And in the minority of cases, they're probably concerned also about raising the ire of President Trump, who has attacked some companies, including Walmart, for announcing price increases because of tariffs. And a fourth is many of them also stocked up on a lot of goods, and so some of them are still making their way through that pre-tariff inventory and therefore don't need to raise prices on that inventory yet. Will these costs eventually get passed on to consumers? Eventually, most economists expect companies to pass this along to consumers in one way or another. The most obvious way would be to raise prices to match the tariff level. Another way companies pass on the pain to the rest of us is they don't hire as many people. They may fire people. They may not introduce as many new products that maybe we all want. They may decide that importing something is too expensive and they're not really able to charge enough to make it worth their while. What role are foreign suppliers playing in this dynamic? Broadly, foreign suppliers are not cutting their prices. So that means foreign companies are not footing the bill, and so that leaves U.S. companies and consumers to absorb the cost. At the same time, we haven't really seen consumer inflation go up very much yet, which means the rest of us are not paying too much of the cost yet. So really, it's U.S. companies so far that have been on the hook to absorb it. That was WSJ economics reporter Jean Whalen. Thanks, Jean. Sure thing. And hopes are rising for a trade deal between the U.S. and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said today that she had a good call with President Trump, and the two had agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations. According to people familiar with their thinking, European officials are optimistic that they're nearing an agreement on an outline deal that could see the European Union accept 15 percent baseline tariffs on most goods. But the people have emphasized that any agreement would need Trump's approval and could be upended if he pushes for significant additional concessions. A deal with Europe would be by far the biggest of several recent such agreements as Trump seeks to redraw international trading rules. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose today to fresh highs following a busy week of tariff updates and earnings. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent, ending the week with its fifth straight record close, its longest such streak in over a year. The Nasdaq rose about 0.2 percent, and the Dow added more than 20 points, or about half a percent. Meta platforms said it would stop political advertisements from being displayed on its social networks in the European Union starting in October, citing an incoming law designed to tackle misinformation and foreign interference in elections. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement follows a similar move from Alphabet's Google, which last November said it would halt political ads in Europe. The biggest name in Jeffrey Epstein's 2003 birthday book was a past president rather than a future one. According to people involved in putting the gift together, Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was keen for Bill Clinton and other boldface names to submit letters. In the end, she was successful. The leather-bound album, assembled before Epstein was first arrested in 2006, included a page with a single paragraph in Clinton's distinctive scrawl. A spokesman for Clinton declined to comment on the birthday message, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He referred the journal to a previous statement that the former president had cut off ties more than a decade before Epstein was arrested in 2019 and didn't know about Epstein's alleged crimes. According to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the former president was among five dozen people, including Donald Trump, Wall Street billionaire Leon Black, fashion designer Vera Wang, and media owner Mort Zuckerman, who ended up with letters in the 2003 book. Black has said he regretted having any involvement with Epstein. Zuckerman and Wang didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2023, Wang had told the journal that she regrets ever associating with Epstein.

Total new credit card openings across four major lenders fell 5% in the second quarter. That's the first decline in more than a year. But it's not affecting all customers equally. Amani Moiz, who covers personal economics for the journal, is here now with more. Amani, who are banks targeting for new credit cards? Banks really want the big spenders. People with high credit scores, people who are going to charge maybe $4,000 a month on a card and pay it off. That's who they're really going after with ads right now. If you have a lower credit score, you're probably not seeing as many credit card off piling up in your mailbox. About 80% of credit card offers in the most recent study that I saw went to people who are considered to have exceptional credit. So that means a credit score above 780. Why are they doing this? It makes sense if you're a bank to focus on this segment because they went in two ways. Big spenders, they spend more money and banks earn revenue every single time you make a purchase with your credit card. That's called interchange fees. And on the other side of it, these customers are more likely to pay off their bill in full every month. So they're less of a credit risk. What does this show us about how banks are thinking about the economy right now? It shows that banks are cautious. So overall on earnings over the past few weeks, banks said that the economy continues to be really, really strong. But there are some concerns about potential rising unemployment or how tariffs and trade tensions are going to translate for the consumer's pockets. So they are hedging a bit by focusing on customers that they see as safer. How big of a shift is this really for lenders? It's like a faucet. And they increase the flow and decrease the flow. Right now they're slightly decreasing the flow, narrowing the customers that they want to focus on. But when times are good and they think that they can make money off of more people, they're going to twist it in the opposite direction and kind of open the floodgates for credit, which we saw in 2021. That was WSJ personal economics reporter Imani Moise. Thanks, Imani. Thank you. The White House is seeking fines from several universities, it says, failed to stop anti-Semitism on campus in exchange for allowing the schools to access federal funding. That's according to a person familiar with the matter. White House correspondent Natalie Andrews joins me now. Natalie, earlier this week, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million to the federal government. How does that fit in with what the White House is asking of these other universities? The case with Columbia is going to be seen as the blueprint for how the other schools get access to their federal funding again. Cornell, Duke and Harvard are key. We know they're in talks with the administration. And this is the higher echelons of the administration there. We're looking at all sorts of agencies that deal with the Civil Rights Act and education are in talks with these schools. What have the schools said about these talks? For many of the schools publicly, this is a no comment type of issue. A lot of these schools are doing a delicate dance of wanting the funding from the administration. This is federal funding that they rely on for research, for grants. And with also their alumni, many of them who may be for more liberal leaning schools, you do not want to see them so-called caving to the administration. So it's a delicate dance for a lot of these schools who are trying to please their alumni, their faculty and also get that federal funding back. I'm curious how the deal with Columbia is going over at the university and the broader higher education community. It is not exactly what you would call something that universities love, this idea that they are going to settle with an administration. But on a wider scale, this is an issue that was very popular for Donald Trump and his campaigning. And a lot of people feel like the universities have become too liberal. So while in campus community, this may not be favorable, definitely there are audiences where it does play very well. That was WSJ White House correspondent Natalie Andrews. Thanks, Natalie. Thanks so much for having me. And police are searching for a suspect after a shooting at the University of New Mexico campus today left one person dead and another injured. The university in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said on social media it was sheltering in place following the shooting in a student apartment building early today. Adding that the shooter had a firearm and might still be on campus. School officials haven't named the shooter or the victims. The university said the surviving victims' injuries weren't life-threatening. And that's what's news for this week. Tomorrow, you can look out for our weekly markets wrap-up, What's News in Markets.
