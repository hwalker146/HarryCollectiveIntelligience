**Full Transcript:**
Talking tough, President Trump throws down a challenge to his Russian counterpart ahead of their high-stakes summit in Alaska. It's a war that should have never happened. If I weren't president, in my opinion, he would much rather take over all of Ukraine. But I am president and he's not going to mess around with me. Plus, could the US government take a stake in Intel? We report on another possible departure from business as usual under Trump. And Apple brings back blood oxygen monitoring to some of its watches. It's Friday, August 15th. I'm Azhar Soukri for the Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. President Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will arrive in Alaska today with two very different goals in mind for how to end the war in Ukraine. After initially playing down the summit as a way to feel out Putin's position, Trump in recent days has said he would urge Putin to accept a ceasefire, seeking to jumpstart long-stalled negotiations. For Putin, the aim when the leaders meet at an airbase outside of Anchorage will be to stay in Trump's good graces while still trying to reassert Moscow's dominance over Kiev. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he wants to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into the talks. I think it's going to be a good meeting, but the more important meeting will be the second meeting that we're having. We're going to have a meeting with President Putin, President Zelensky, myself, and maybe we'll bring some of the European leaders along, maybe not. I don't know that it's going to be very important. We're going to see what happens. And I think President Putin will make peace. I think President Zelensky will make peace. We'll see if they can get along. And if they can, it'll be great. But while Trump is aiming to move quickly to bring an end to the war, journal correspondent Thomas Grove says Putin will be happy to play the long game. One of the most important things that this does for Russia and Putin right now is that it prolongs peace talks. It basically extends the amount of time during which Russia can show that it's being a good partner in peace talks and that it wants to move forward towards peace without getting sanctioned. Trump has threatened sanctions more and more in the past as he's become visibly frustrated with Russia. For Trump is ultimately showing the United States and the rest of the world that he was able to clinch a very hard to attain peace between Russia and Ukraine. He's telegraphed that his own expectations for that may be low. When it comes to Russia, they want to see relations normalized as much as they can be between the US and Russia. They want international recognition for the gains that they've made on the battlefield and continue to make on the battlefield. And coming up later in the show, we'll look at how the military situation on the ground may force Ukraine to reluctantly give up territory to Russia in exchange for peace. In Washington, Attorney General Pam Bondi has tapped Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the so-called emergency police commissioner to lead the city's Metropolitan Police Department. Bondi said in a directive that the local police must receive approval from Cole before issuing any orders, leading city officials to reject President Trump's latest move to tighten his grip on DC's local police force. Responding to the order in a social media post, Mayor Muriel Bowser said there was, quote, no statute that conveys the district's personnel authority to a federal official. Trump sent the National Guard to the city for at least a month, while Bondi has also opened the door for ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to take a more active role in the capital. Intel and the Trump administration are discussing the possibility of the US government taking a financial stake in the troubled chipmaker. That's according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, Trump called for CEO Lip Bu Tan to step down, describing him as being, quote, highly conflicted. That was a reference to Tan's web of investments in Chinese technology companies. Journal reporter Stu Wu says the deal could advance the President's America First manufacturing agenda, while relieving political pressure on the company's beleaguered chief executive. Stu, what do we know so far about this pretty unusual proposal? So President Trump discussed this idea during a meeting at the White House on Monday with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan. And that's according to my colleagues reporting. And these talks are in really early stages right now. They could still fall apart. If it did happen, it would be unprecedented, the US government taking an active role in a private company. Why is Trump describing Tan as being conflicted in this case? Lip Bu Tan is known as Mr. Chip, but that's not because of what he's done in America. He was a venture capitalist who invested in a lot of chip companies that have become some of the biggest and most important in China. So that's number one. The second thing is that, more recently, he spent 12 years as CEO of a silicon company called Cadence. And a couple weeks ago, Cadence pled guilty to selling illegal technology to a Chinese military university. And that happened during Tan's tenure. And so Trump is implying, hey, Intel is one of the most important chip companies in America. Can we trust this guy to lead it? Intel is definitely one of the most important companies in America, as you say. Trump has been far more interventionist in the tech sector than his predecessors. Tell us more about that. So I think there are two things happening here. The first thing is that the US government believes the military battles of the future are going to be won via artificial intelligence. AI helps design nuclear weapons, fighter jets, missiles, things like that. And the thing that powers the best AI are cutting edge computer chips. The issue is that the US really doesn't make its own computer chips right now. Intel is their best shot at doing that. So they really want to ensure that if something happens to America's trading partners, that they can produce the best computer chips in America itself. So that's number one. The second thing is that Trump has just taken a more active stance in the matters of private companies. So he recently got Nvidia and AMD, two other chip companies, to pay the government 15% of their sales to China in exchange for exporting these really coveted chips. He also approved a recent deal between a Japanese steel company buying an American one. But the US government has a golden share. They have some say into how it operates. So the US government under the Trump administration is really saying, hey, these things, steel, advanced computer chips, that really matters to American national security. So we wanted to have a say as to how you run your private companies. Journal reporter Stu Wu, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today. Thanks for having me. Now here's a bit of good news. If you're an Apple Watch user and have been missing its blood oxygen feature, it's back. Nearly two years after Apple removed the capability due to a bruising patent dispute with medical tech firm Massimo, the US giant has reinstated it in some models. Apple said users of some models of the Watch Series 9 and 10, as well as the Ultra 2, would be able to use the redesigned feature following a software update. A spokesman for Massimo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Staying with Apple, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold shares in the iPhone maker during the second quarter, further reducing its stake. That's according to a regulatory filing by Berkshire yesterday. At the same time, the Omaha, Nebraska company added Insura United Health Group to its portfolio. Coming up, with Ukraine on the back foot militarily in its war with Russia, we look at how the Trump-Putin meeting could affect prospects for peace. That story after the break. Now, as we heard earlier, one of the main sticking points in today's summit between President Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is likely to be the issue of Ukrainian territory. As the Journal's South Europe bureau chief Marcus Walker says, a ceasefire remains a long shot despite the meeting. That's because Putin is demanding that Ukraine retreat from strategically vital regions, a demand that Kyiv and its European allies flatly reject. For Putin, it's about more than just territory. Putin's deeper goal here has been to reimpose political control over Ukraine. That is not only gobble up large swathes of Eastern and Southern Ukraine, but recreate Russia's former and lost political sway over the rump of Ukraine, while also revising the ending of the Cold War and taking a big step towards rebuilding Russia's sphere of influence deep into Eastern Europe. So his strategic goals, which he sees as a kind of historic mission, go much, much further. And for Ukraine and for the Europeans, it's really about limiting this. Now, Ukraine at this point is coming around to accept the bitter reality that they lack the strength to get all of their territory back, potentially forever. They've basically implicitly admitted that, you know, might well be the outcome in this call between the Europeans and Trump. Zelensky and the others were saying, look, first we have a ceasefire, then we'll talk about territory. So by saying he's willing to talk about territory, he's admitting he's not going to get it all back. As for the bigger picture, well, it's pretty much as it has been for the past two years, really. The Russians are grinding forward slowly and at a very, very high cost in lives, in killed and wounded men, while the Ukrainians are also suffering losses, less so, but at a level that they are struggling to replace. So the dynamic over time is not at all favorable for Ukraine. The war has been compared by many people to a mix of World War I and high-tech drones. I made a long tour of almost the entire front line in the southeast and the north last month. And yeah, it's a combination of very old-fashioned, extremely gruesome and grueling infantry fighting with artillery and other conventional forms of firepower, but in the sky, an increasingly sophisticated war of drones using all sorts of advanced technology, including AI. So Marcus, finally, is this summit going to be able to end the war? It would be a big surprise. Much as the Ukrainians are tired, the Europeans would love to move on. Trump would love to get a deal and move on. But Putin has not got the result he wants yet, which is to reimpose political control over Ukraine. And if Russia sticks to its broader political goals, then unfortunately, we are a long way from the end of the war because nobody is yet putting enough pressure on Russia to rethink and to scale down those political goals. That's Journal South Europe Bureau Chief Marcus Walker. Marcus, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. And that's it for What's News for this Friday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bark. Our supervising producer is Piers Lynch. I'm Azhar Soukri for The Wall Street Journal. We'll be back tonight with a new show. Until then, have a great weekend and thanks for listening.

### How Blue States Plan to Get More Taxes From Wealthy Residents
**Publication Date:** 2025-08-14T20:45:00
**Episode ID:** 5074

**Full Transcript:**
Relief ahead for U.S. buyers and sellers, as mortgage rates hit their lowest level this year. Plus, how some blue states are planning to get more in taxes from their wealthiest residents. A lot of states are in a situation where they could be facing budget deficits going forward. And then once you add into the picture the potential impact of the new federal tax law, the picture can start to get more bleak. And after riding the A.I. boom, can Corweave keep its investors enthused? It's Thursday, August 14th. I'm Alex Osoleff for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. We begin this evening's show with a lead up to President Trump's planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow in Alaska. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt said today that Trump and Putin will hold a joint press conference after their one-on-one meeting in Anchorage. Ahead of his trip to Alaska, Trump said in an interview with Fox News Radio air today that he thinks Putin is, quote, going to make a deal. But he said there was a 25 percent chance talks would fail, describing the summit as a chess game. If the meeting goes well, Trump raised the possibility of inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for further negotiations. During a meeting with senior ministers and security officials today, Putin said that the Trump administration had been making, quote, what I consider to be fairly vigorous and sincere efforts to halt hostilities, resolve the crisis and reach agreements that serve the interests of all parties involved in this conflict. Mortgage rates edged down to their lowest level of the year, offering a dash of hope to prospective buyers who have been forced to the sidelines by elevated rates and home prices. According to a survey of lenders by mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac, the average rate on the standard 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 6.58 percent. That was a low not seen since October 2024, and down from 6.63 percent a week earlier. Mortgage rates tend to move loosely with government bond yields, which helps set some borrowing costs across the economy. Bond yields have edged lower after a report this month showed hiring slowed sharply over the summer, putting downward pressure on mortgage rates. Americans' nest eggs are increasingly tied to the fate of the stock market. According to Vanguard Group, workers in their late 30s had 88 percent of their 401ks in stocks last year, versus 82 percent a decade earlier. 401k investors in their early 60s had allocations to stocks of 60 percent, up from 57 percent a decade ago. Ann Turgison covers retirement for the Journal and joins me now. Ann, how are investors behaving with their 401ks versus, say, a retail investment? So 401k investors tend to really buy and hold. And there have been many more days in which trading activity in 401ks has spiked. However, we're talking only like about 1.3 percent of assets in 401ks have been traded this year. That's a high level relative to what you normally see. That just shows you how infrequently people trade. What kinds of risks does that come with? The risk of having more in stocks means that if the stock market really hits like a bad time, then it sets you up for higher losses than you would have had if you were more conservatively invested. That said, historically, one of the biggest risks that investors had run is that they had insufficient exposure to the stock market at younger ages. And so target date funds, which are these all-in-one investments that are professionally managed and that 401k investors are put into if they're automatically enrolled, that's been a really good development for people who are younger. That was WSJ reporter, Anne Turgeson. Thank you, Anne. Thanks for having me. Major U.S. indexes remain mostly unchanged today as stocks retraced some earlier declines fueled by a pickup in factory gate inflation. This morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that wholesale prices increased by 0.9 percent last month. That's higher than the 0.2 percent that economists expected. It was the largest monthly rise in more than three years. That prompted traders to slightly pair bets on the September rate cut from the Fed. In the end, the Dow and the Nasdaq lost about a tenth of a percent, while the S&P 500 was up around three tenths of a percent. Since going public in March, AI cloud services company CoreWeave has soared. The company just posted $1.2 billion in revenue for the second quarter, more than triple what it generated in the same period a year earlier. And its stock has nearly tripled from its IPO price. But soon it may face a test to see if investors can maintain that enthusiasm. For more, I'm joined now by WSJ heard on the street columnist Dan Gallagher. Dan, why is CoreWeave doing so well? A lot of it has to do with essentially hype over AI and over that market. What CoreWeave does is specialized data center networks that are specifically tailored to AI computing, the training, the inference that goes on. They're a relatively small company compared to the huge companies that are big players in this game. But CoreWeave is a pretty sizable player itself in this specific type of market. We've seen a bunch of tech IPOs recently, including a number of crypto exchanges and software company Figma, but we haven't actually seen that many AI companies. And back in March, when CoreWeave went public, you wrote that CoreWeave's IPO is a test to see whether AI demand can stick. What is your kind of answer to that question now? So far, it's proven to work well for them because if you think about it, they really trade on where the spending goes for AI from these bigger companies. And since March, we've seen these huge companies, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, they were spending a huge amount already. And they've taken that up even further and signaled that they're going to spend even more next year. So in that sense, that's been great for CoreWeave. CoreWeave's market cap is in the neighborhood of $50 billion, quite a high valuation like that of many tech companies, particularly for those involved in AI. Can these companies sustain this? Well, the stock will probably do well as long as these AI demand signals are there. If you look at them relative to these other companies where they're in a way competing a little bit with Microsoft's and Meta's of the world, those companies have huge cash flow. CoreWeave is actually burning cash. If the bottom fell out of the AI market, Microsoft still has a lot of businesses that are going to make a lot of money. CoreWeave, this is what they do. So in that sense, they're probably the most levered bet on this AI demand curve continuing to ramp. That was WSJ heard on the street columnist Dan Gallagher. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. Coming up, are states raising taxes on rich residents, risking scaring them off? That's after the break. If you work as a manufacturing facilities engineer, installing a new piece of equipment can be as complex as the machinery itself. From prep work to alignment and testing, it's your team's job to put it all together. That's why it's good to have Grainger on your side. With industrial grade products and next day delivery, Grainger helps ensure you have everything you need close at hand through every step of the installation. Call 1-800-GRAINGER, click grainger.com or just stop by. Grainger, for the ones who get it done. A growing number of blue cities and states across the country are looking at ways to wring more revenue from their richest taxpayers. They're looking to make up for projected shortfalls in federal funding related to President Trump's new tax law or address existing state budget deficits. WSJ economics reporter Juliet Chung is here to discuss. Juliet, what are the kinds of rules that some of these legislators are proposing? There's a variety of things, but in general, they're looking to get more revenue from some of their richest taxpayers. So things like higher tax rates on their highest earning residents, folks making, say, a million or more a year, increasing the amount of tax that they pay on capital gains or increasing the property tax rate for vacation homes assessed over a certain value. What are some of the states considering new legislation? You know, they range across the country. They tend to be blue states. And there are states that have already signed some of that legislation into law and there are states that are considering provisions like this. So you've got Washington state, where the Democratic governor earlier this year signed a new budget that includes a hike to the existing capital gains tax. In New York City, the frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race, Soran Mamadani, has proposed a millionaire's tax. Massachusetts has come up as providing inspiration for legislators in other states who are thinking about ways to increase revenue. Massachusetts passed its version of a millionaire's tax a few years ago, and the revenue brought in by that income surtax has pretty consistently beaten the forecast of revenue that surtax is expected to bring in. This is occurring against a general backdrop where a lot of states were sort of flush with money in the years right after the pandemic. A lot of states are in a situation where they could be facing budget deficits going forward. And then once you add into the picture the potential impact of the new federal tax law, the picture can start to get more bleak. You know, Juliet, I have to wonder that, you know, having a balanced budget is all well and good. But is there a risk that some of these states are running and potentially driving away some of their wealthiest residents just to go elsewhere with a lower tax rate? There is an element of tax gamesmanship that can occur. The academic data on this is sort of mixed. On the one hand, there's a lot of data and research out there showing that millionaires are actually pretty sticky when it comes to their geographic residence. Even when their taxes go up a significant amount, that can change depending on the specifics of wealth. So if you're looking at a group like older billionaires, they tend to have a higher sensitivity to taxes. But there's some academic data out there that suggests that efforts to bring in more revenue through increasing taxes can still be worth it, even with some level of rich residents leaving an area. That was WSJ reporter Juliet Chung. Thank you, Juliet. Thank you. In other news, Florida is planning to open a second state-run immigration detention center as legal challenges continue over the facility known as Alligator Alcatraz. Governor Ron DeSantis said in a press conference today that the new facility, dubbed Deportation Depot, will be run out of Baker Correctional Institution in northern Florida. He said that the site will be able to hold more than 1,300 people and that costs will be reimbursed by federal partners. DeSantis added that the facility will be operational soon. The state-run facilities are an early test in the Trump administration's effort to open up more detention space across the country. Officials have ramped up arrests and limited bail for detained immigrants, which has created an urgent demand for additional beds. And Air Canada says it has started to cancel flights and expects to wind down operations by early Saturday morning as the carrier braces for a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. Air Canada executives said that about 500 flights would be grounded by midnight Friday. In a best case scenario, it would take about a week to restore full operations if and when a labor agreement is reached with the flight attendants union. And that's what's news for this Thursday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bien-Aimé with supervising producer Michael Cosmidis. I'm Alex Ocelot for The Wall Street Journal. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening. I'm Alex Ocelot for The Wall Street Journal.

### Can Democrats Embrace AI and Win Back Silicon Valley?

K-Pop Demon Hunters, a sing-along event, in select theaters, August 23rd and 24th. Rated PG. Get tickets now, at singkpopdemonhunters.com As the clock ticks down to the crucial Trump-Putin summit, Ukraine's president tries to ensure his country's needs are heard. Plus, how Democrats can win back Silicon Valley. Democratic leaders often just go to Silicon Valley and stick their hands out and ask for money because they view it as a stronghold without really engaging in a genuine way on policy issues. And engage hyperspeed. Trump wants to accelerate rocket launches and spaceport development. It's Thursday, August 14th. I'm Azhar Soukry for The Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News. The top headlines and business stories moving your world today. The world's attention will be focused on the Euro summit in Alaska between President Trump and his Russian counterpart to discuss a possible end to the war in Ukraine. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is not invited to the Trump-Putin meeting. He's been in discussions with European leaders and is in London for a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Matthew Luxmore is the journal's foreign correspondent. Matthew, what is Zelensky hoping that Trump and Putin will agree to in their summit? Well, in many ways, Zelensky is hoping they agree to nothing. Zelensky doesn't want anything to be agreed about Ukraine without Ukraine's involvement. He's really rallied European leaders, the world leaders, since this summit was announced to try and get them to prevail on Trump and get him to agree to essentially not agree on anything with Putin when it comes to Ukraine. Everyone's noticed that Trump initially was talking about land being swapped between the two countries, saying that this is something that is going to be necessary for this war to end. The White House has really rode back on those statements in the last couple of days. He's already told Zelensky and the Europeans that he will not be hashing out any land agreements with Putin. Really, for Trump, as he's put it himself, this is a kind of feel-out meeting. As the White House has said, it's a kind of way for the two leaders to get together and for Trump to better understand what Putin's position is, because he feels like Putin has kind of been dragging this process on, and I think he wants to understand how serious Putin is about striking a peace deal in Ukraine. Yeah, it really does sound like Trump has come round to thinking along the lines of what European leaders have been saying for some time. Now, even though Putin is refusing to meet Zelensky, Russia and Ukraine have actually been exchanging thousands of prisoners over the course of the war. Yeah, the exchange of tens of thousands of prisoners since the beginning of the war, something that's really unprecedented for two countries during the course of a conflict and not after it, is a kind of fascinating subplot of this war, and one that really hasn't been covered very much, because these exchanges are taking place quietly, often away from the glare of the media and the attention of journalists, hundreds of people on a weekly basis recently crossing the border from Russia and Ukraine, many of them emaciated, barely clinging to consciousness. The reason this story is so fascinating is because this regular exchange of prisoners and the secret channels that are being used to arrange these swaps are kind of the one thin wire that still connects these two warring countries to each other. Looking at the way this is done is kind of a good way of looking and kind of trying to understand how Ukraine and Russia might rebuild a relationship after this war is over. These are two countries that 35 years ago were part of the same country and now really have completely stopped any formal relations with each other, but in the course of swapping prisoners, they are still talking to each other and that is kind of a fascinating and undercover aspect of the war. Journal Foreign Correspondent Matthew Luxmore, thank you so much. Thank you. Turning to markets news now and investors will get the latest snapshot on how tariffs are impacting wholesale inflation this morning, with the producer price index for July due out at 8.30am Eastern. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal say factory gate prices probably rose in July from the previous month after the index held steady in June, undershooting forecasts. The PPI follows Tuesday's consumer price index, which showed inflation holding steady in July, helping cement expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. That helped lift the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record closing highs for the second straight day. In less welcome news for the health of the economy, the disappointing July jobs report that led to President Trump firing the head of the Bureau of Labour Statistics has revealed another trend for American workers. Wage growth for lower income workers has slowed significantly in recent months, while higher income wage growth is holding steady and journal finance editor Quentin Webb says that shift could matter not just for low paid workers, but the overall economy. And what that tells us about the economy is that we're in this kind of rather strange period for the labour market where you shouldn't say it's falling off a cliff, but at the same time employers are becoming a little bit more reluctant both to hire and to fire. And so that tends to affect the lower end of the income spectrum more because the best way in many cases for people to get pay rises is to switch jobs. And when there's less job switching going on, you tend to see fewer pay rises. A deadly explosion at a US steel mill near Pittsburgh earlier this week could test Nippon Steel's resolve over its American investment plans in what could prove to be a costly crisis. The Japanese company promised to spend $14bn to keep US steel's ageing plants humming for decades, including more than $2bn by 2028 for upgrades at the Clareton plant, where an explosion on Monday killed two workers and injured ten others. Crews are continuing to clean up the site, where it'll likely cost the company millions of dollars to return it to normal operations. US steel officials said the blast reduced the company's ability to produce coke at its Mon Valley Works complex, a key steelmaking input. Coming up, we look at what the Democrats need to do to win back the love of what used to be one of their most reliable sources of support, Silicon Valley. That story and more after the break. I'm Ashley Graham, and as a parent, I know the back-to-school transition can be a lot. When it comes to wellness, Ollie supports me and my family through it all. Kids Multi is big in my house. It supports their immune system, and they love to take it. A win-win for everyone. Shop these products at Ollie.com or retailers nationwide. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Looking to space now, and President Trump has issued an executive order that aims to speed up rocket launches and open the door to more spaceport developments. Many space industry executives have been frustrated by the pace at which regulators have moved to permit launches and other space operations. The alliance between Trump and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk had fuelled hopes of speedier launches until the pair's high profile split earlier this year. Currently, SpaceX launches more rockets more often than any other company, meaning the order to speed up the licensing of flights should help it. But other launches including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance are also poised to begin flying their new rockets more often in the years ahead. And staying with the tech industry, Silicon Valley had been a reliable source of support for the Democratic Party for decades. No more. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said he's quote, politically homeless after Democrats lost their way. And Republicans say there has never been more enthusiasm for their party in tech circles. Journal tech reporter Amrit Ramkumar says the trend is fueling concerns among Democrats that dwindling support among tech elites is yet another obstacle. The party is facing its lowest poll numbers in more than three decades. Amrit, so what's driving Silicon Valley executives into the arms of the Republicans when they used to be solidly behind the Democrats before? Yeah, it's a really interesting issue. I think it's important to contextualise. Most Silicon Valley executives and workers are still reliably Democrats. But this is more about vibes, I think, than anything else. And last year in the election, you saw Elon Musk pour money into arms of the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump. And you saw notable people like Marc Andreessen and Chamath Palihapitiya, billionaire venture capitalists, abandoned the Democrats in favour of the Republicans. That and sort of dwindling enthusiasm among executives and people who still might support Democrats but don't like where they are on tech issues. And the big driver is really the regulatory stance of the last administration. They tried to sort of regulate a lot of crypto companies and investigate them for breaking the law. And people viewed those actions as trying to regulate a key sector out of existence for AI and things like that. But I think it's more that Democrats haven't really said how they want to support AI or indicated that they're excited about the technology and what it can do. And more broadly, that's just been a common theme. A lot of Democrats have focused on social media harming children online and things like that, which are definitely big problems. But people in tech circles feel like they've been demonized a bit too much. And people we've talked to who have been looking at this issue for a while said they want to chart a course forward where you're not going easy on tech elites and sort of just condoning everything they're doing with Trump, but you also can still be positive about the future and technology. So it'll be really interesting if some new candidates or new voices can sort of outline those priorities. So from what you're saying, from a tech executive's point of view, it boils down to the issue of which party is embracing AI more thoroughly and that in their eyes is the Republicans. So that's the view from the C-suite. But what about tech workers? It's a rather different story in terms of who they support, right? Yeah, I'm not actually sure it's that much of a huge difference. It's usually like 80 to 90% of donations from workers at these tech companies that go to Democrats. I think it's more just about like how motivated they are and whether they feel that Democrats are actually going to do things that help them. We've heard recently that more people feel like Democratic leaders often just go to Silicon Valley and stick their hands out and ask for money because they view it as a stronghold without really engaging in a genuine way on policy issues, especially if you do think about how fast AI is improving and where things might be in a few years. So that's definitely not the only calculus for executives, but it is a big one. So what can the Democrats do to win back the support of Silicon Valley? The biggest thing Democrats can do to shore up support in this area, people have said, is just put out sort of a pro-innovation positive message on tech policy and tech issues. So a group of House Democrats recently put out basically a pro-innovation agenda. So some people are viewing that as sort of a starting point and it will be interesting as we move forward what party leaders gravitate toward. A lot of people have been in a tough spot because they want to push back on everything Trump does, but some of his policies around cryptocurrencies or AI in many cases are generally pretty popular. So it's often hard for many people to draw that line so that's something they're struggling with and will continue to moving forward. Journal Tech reporter Amrit Ramkumar, thank you so much. Thanks for having me. And that's it for What's News for this Thursday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bark. Our supervising producer is Piers Lynch.

Discover more at Viking.com. President Trump calls for Goldman Sachs to replace its chief economist over his past predictions on the impact of tariffs. Plus, AI startup Perplexity makes a bid for Google's Chrome browser. Can it succeed? And the White House's goal behind its review of the Smithsonian Museums. They've really focused on any narrative that they deem to be partisan or anything that downplays their idea of American exceptionalism. It's Tuesday, August 12th. I'm Alex Osolev for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. Let's start with the latest data on U.S. inflation. New data from the Labor Department out today showed that consumer prices were up 2.7 percent in July from a year earlier. That was unchanged from June's gain of 2.7 percent and below the 2.8 percent rise that economists expected. But prices excluding food and energy categories, the so-called core measure economists watch in an effort to better capture inflation's underlying trend, rose 3.1 percent over the last 12 months, above forecasts for a 3 percent increase. For more on what this data means, I'm joined by WSJ economics reporter Rachel Wolff. Rachel, tariffs have been around for six months. I know that a lot of economists were watching this data to see if tariffs are having an effect. What are we seeing here? So in June, we started to see the first signs that tariffs were beginning to get passed on to consumers. We saw a little more of that in July. So in categories that have a lot of imports, like furniture, tires, pet products, there were larger than normal increases last month. That being said, it wasn't consistent across the board. So some economists thought that apparel, for instance, would see bigger price increases by now because we import a lot of clothes. But so far, it has not gone up as much as economists predicted. And a reason why could be that retailers really stocked up in advance of tariffs. They might be sitting on a lot of supply. New car prices, same deal. What else could be driving prices up besides tariffs? So economists were looking at goods for this inflation report. They were really expecting to see increases concentrated in stuff. But really what we ended up seeing was that services like airline tickets and medical services and car maintenance went up more than predicted. For instance, airline tickets were up 4%. And what economists think that that is tied to is that the job market is still pretty strong and people are still spending money. And that means that it's not just tariffs having an effect. It's also people spending money. That was WSJ economics reporter Rachel Wolff. Thank you, Rachel. Thanks so much. The latest consumer price report made investors more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates next month. Major U.S. indexes were up. The Nasdaq rose about 1.5%, hitting a new record, its 19th of the year. The S&P 500 added about 1.1%, notching its 16th record so far this year. The Dow also advanced 1.1%. President Trump appeared to call for Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to replace the bank's top economist over his past predictions. Posting on social media today, the president said that Solomon should, quote, go out and get himself a new economist because the bank, he said, made a bad prediction a long time ago on the market and tariffs. The president asserted that tariffs haven't caused inflation or other issues for the U.S. economy. Trump appears to be referring to Jan Hatzius, the bank's longtime chief economist, though he didn't call him out by name or title. Hatzius and his team have been among the many economists who have predicted tariff policies would dent labor markets, cause higher inflation, and slow U.S. economic growth. Trump also questioned whether Solomon himself should focus on just being a DJ, a reference to the bank chief's former side gig. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Trump's post. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. It's the president's latest broadside against executives he believes are undermining his goals. We're exclusively reporting that artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. Two subsidiaries of News Corp., parent of the journal, have sued Perplexity. Catherine Blunt covers Google's parent alphabet for the journal and is here to tell us more about the offer. Catherine, Perplexity is valued at about $18 billion. So can it afford this $34.5 billion price tag? Excellent question, right? The company says that it has commitments from several large funds, including BC Funds, to back the entirety of the transaction. We don't have any more detail than that at this point. But yeah, it is significantly more than the current valuation of the company. It feels like not a coincidence that this unsolicited offer is coming at a time when Google Chrome might actually be spun off from the company, potentially. Last year, a U.S. district judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market and is expected to rule this month on how to restore competition. How does this offer fit in with this potential outcome? Yeah, it's not a coincidence at all. The Justice Department filed a suit against Google in 2020, and it's taken quite a while to get to this remedies phase of the trial. But the judge is considering a number of different options, considering limiting the company's ability to pay to be the default browser on phones and other devices, requiring it to share data with rivals, and as we're talking about now, potentially forcing a divestiture of Chrome. The company doesn't want to do any of the proposed remedies, at least not with the sweep that's been proposed by the Justice Department. And in particular said that like selling Chrome or having to share data with rivals would be really harmful to the overall business. A spokesperson for Google declined to comment on the offer. But how likely is a sale of Chrome to actually happen? Analysts have generally considered a forced sale of Chrome to be unlikely relative to the other potential remedies on the table. The judge did remark earlier this year during closing arguments at the trial that maybe this is a cleaner solution than some of the more complicated proposals on the table. But that doesn't really give us a great indication one way or the other how he's thinking about it. The ruling should come within the next few weeks. He has said he expects to release a ruling in August. That was WSJ reporter, Katherine Blunt. Thank you, Katherine. Thanks for having me.

Pro's number one most trusted app based on August 2024 proprietary survey. In an exclusive, we're reporting that the White House plans to conduct a far-reaching review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions, materials, and operations ahead of America's 250th anniversary to ensure the museums align with President Trump's interpretation of American history. That's according to a letter sent today by three top White House officials to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and viewed by the Wall Street Journal. Meredith McGraw covers the White House for the Journal and is here now with more. Meredith, what will this review entail? So the White House is looking to do a pretty comprehensive review of everything from the little placards that are under exhibits in the Smithsonian museums to how curators come up with the ideas for the exhibits or even grants and internal communication on their programming. And it's all part of the White House's goals to try to reshape and re-envision American history, especially ahead of the 250th anniversary next year. And so this team at the White House said that they're going to be going through their proposals. They asked the Smithsonian to tap representatives for each of their museums to work with them and they're going to be doing walkthroughs of the current exhibits to take note of some of the themes and messaging and even conduct some interviews with the curators as well to make sure that everybody's on the same page and that they're mostly reflecting this executive order that the White House issued to, quote, restore truth and sanity to American history. And they've really focused on any sort of narrative that they deem to be partisan or anything that downplays their idea of American exceptionalism. What is the Trump administration's goal with this review? President Trump has really tried to put his own touch on some of the country's cultural institutions and that ranges from big universities to some of these museums. And the president really is focused on putting American history in a positive light and honed in on anything that they say has political influence or bias. What does the Smithsonian have to say about it? So far, the Smithsonian hasn't had a response to the letter, but we know that Lonnie Bunch has been in contact with White House officials and has given them tours of the museums. And Vice President J.D. Vance is among those who's on the board of regents that agreed to conduct reviews of some of the museums earlier this year. And what happens next? Is there a timeline for this review? The letter pretty clearly outlines within the next 30 days, 75 days, 120 days what their expectations are for the different museums in terms of the materials that they need to hand over to the White House for review or the materials that they need to come up with to celebrate the 250th anniversary, some of the messaging or programming around that. And the letter said that they hope to wrap up all of this in time for celebrations to begin in 2026. That was WSJ reporter Meredith McGraw. Thanks Meredith. Thank you. And finally, Harvard University is nearing a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration. If it does happen, it would be the largest payout the White House has won so far in its campaign to punish universities that it says failed to stop anti-Semitism on campus. A person familiar with the negotiations said that under the terms of the deal, which isn't final, the university would pay $500 million to workforce and vocational programs, not to the federal government. In turn, the Trump administration would restore billions in frozen federal dollars to the school for research and other programs. The administration wouldn't appoint a monitor to oversee Harvard's compliance with the deal. The university would pledge to continue to abide by federal regulations around merit-based hiring and admissions, as well as protecting students' civil rights. An agreement with Harvard isn't finalized, and negotiations are continuing this week. President Trump has attacked Harvard repeatedly in the past few months and would need to approve a final deal. Harvard declined to comment. And that's what's news for this Tuesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bien-Aimé with supervising producer Michael Kosmidis.

**Full Transcript:**

KPMG, make the difference. Learn more at www.kpmg.us insights. President Trump announces his pick for the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, plus with the Trump-Putin summit just days away, Ukraine's fate seems as uncertain as ever. Putin's goal has always been the same since this war began. He wants a puppet regime in Ukraine, if not the outright annexation of all of Ukraine. And so he doesn't see President Zelensky of Ukraine as a legitimate leader, and therefore he refuses to meet with him. And we look at how Chinese ships are set to dominate the world's seas and ports. This Tuesday, August the 12th, I'm Azhar Soukry for The Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. President Trump has said he plans to nominate the chief economist at the Conservative Heritage Foundation to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As we mentioned on yesterday's show, E.J. Antony is a longtime critic of the agency's handling of jobs data. The position requires Senate confirmation. Trump fired the agency's head following a weak jobs report earlier this month, claiming that the agency's economic data was, quote, rigged. Here's our deputy finance editor, Quentin Webb. There is a kind of bigger picture here, which is that actually response rates for all of the surveys that the BLS and other agencies use to collect data have gone down a lot. So you could say there are some genuine questions there about the reliability of the data, or on the other hand, he is also clearly, you know, a partisan figure. And for many people, that is problematic. They say that the BLS should be led by someone who isn't beholden to any particular political position. This data is seen as a kind of global gold standard. People trust U.S. data very deeply, and the data helps inform all kinds of decision making from the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest rates to the pricing of various instruments. So once you start to pull away at that foundation, that could be very problematic for global markets. Well, after the July jobs report raised some questions about the overall health of the economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will give investors another snapshot today. July's consumer price index is due at 8.30 a.m. Eastern Time. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal say prices likely rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months through July. The call reading, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to come in at 3.1 percent year over year, slightly hotter than June's 2.9 percent rate. On this week's episode of WSJ's Take on the Week, co-host Telis Demos reflected on how investors are grappling with the prospect of less than reliable economic data in the future. The last reading was a little hot. It was 2.7 percent, kind of inching toward 3 percent that I think starts to spook everyone. We'll see what the next report says. Also, the producer price index, which kind of is a measure of wholesale prices. Similarly, that has not been too hot. It's been running in the sort of 2 percent. So again, not seeing necessarily the inflation there. And then we have business inventories, which I think that's what I think people will be interested in because the narrative about what's happened with tariffs is that everybody bought up stuff earlier in the year, worrying that the price of it might go up later. And so now everyone's sitting on a big inventory pile. What's interesting from a market point of view, though, is despite the, I would say, very dramatic discussions we're having about the economy and data, the market has been, you know, it went down a little bit after the jobs report. It went kind of back up. I think we're sort of still in the neighborhood of all-time highs for the S&P. And there are certainly some stocks that the market still seems to love. And we will have full coverage and analysis of today's U.S. data on our live blog on WSJ.com. Just three days out from a major summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska, Russian media are reporting on potential energy and infrastructure deals with the U.S. There's even talk of a possible future Trump Tower Moscow. Lasting peace in Ukraine, however, does not seem to be a priority for Moscow, as the journal's chief foreign affairs correspondent, Yaroslav Trofimov, explains. Peace in Ukraine is realistic if President Putin decides that it's in his interest to end the war. And right now he doesn't seem to be interested in that because he thinks that on one hand he is winning on the battlefield with the Russian army advancing, and on the other hand he is not paying any price for that diplomatically because President Trump, after so many threats, has let his deadline for secondary sanctions on Russia lapse without consequence. And Yaroslav says that talks around future business deals with the U.S. cement a new era for Putin. For Putin, really, it's a win-win situation. If he manages to get concessions from the Trump administration on Ukraine to give up land, great. If he can settle a war on his own terms, he'll be fantastic news for Russia. But even if he doesn't, that's still a major geopolitical victory for Putin, you know. For the last three and a half years he's been a pariah, he's been isolated on a world stage, and now all of a sudden he gets to get what Russia always desired, a meeting on equal terms with the United States, where Putin can really posture as a global statesman who is deciding the fate of the world together with his equal, President Trump. Russia's proposal for a ceasefire includes taking control of large parts of eastern Ukraine, a non-starter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. While not invited to the summit, he and European leaders have briefed U.S. officials on an alternate proposal that they hope can kick-start peace talks. Coming up, China is creating the world's biggest shipbuilder as Beijing takes its rivalry with the U.S. to the seas. That story and more after the break. The U.S. and China may have extended their trade truce, but a new battlefront is emerging on the seas. This week, the $16 billion merger of two Chinese companies will create the world's largest shipbuilder. Combined, the two firms, China State Shipbuilding and China Shipbuilding Industry, accounted for almost 17% of the global market last year. The U.S., meanwhile, is looking for a path back into the business. President Trump wants to revive American shipbuilding, though those plans have hit snags recently. And as journal reporter Clarence Leong writes, that rivalry is acting as a spur for Beijing to boost its capacity. Clarence, give us an idea of just how dominant Chinese shipbuilding is on a global scale. Beijing has for decades wanted to build up a dominant and world-leading shipbuilding industry. And given its top-down governance model, it has pulled that off. Nowadays, Chinese built ships account for more than half of the global tonnage. And according to data last year, that share was 55% compared with less than 0.05% for the U.S. And so there's this huge gap. And the U.S. Navy also has data showing that China possesses 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the U.S. And we know that Trump wants to revive shipbuilding in the U.S. It's a flagship policy. Explain to us why it's so strategically important. Yes, a lot of trade happens between countries, and they all rely on these massive cargo vessels to transport the goods. And it keeps the modern world functioning. At the same time, shipbuilding is also a strategically important industry because during times of war, commercial vessels will also probably have to play the role of supplying the operations on the front line, for example. And so that's when having a massive shipbuilding capacity will come in very handy, especially if the conflict drags out. And China realizes this, and so this is why they have poured so much resources into building out this dominant shipbuilding industry that it currently has. And as we talk about it in this trade war, albeit in a current truce with the U.S., what is the significance of that for the shipbuilding industry? Yes, well, perhaps there are two main significance here. The first one is that, as you said, the U.S. is in a trade war with China, and President Trump also wants to revive American shipbuilding. And he knows that by doing that, part of the way to do it will be to target Chinese-built ships. And so he has threatened to charge a hefty port fee on Chinese-built ships that call at U.S. ports. And that has had the effect of deterring ship owners to place new orders with Chinese shipyards. And the second significance is that while we have the U.S. targeting Chinese-made ships, that obviously also has the effect of potentially giving a lift to shipbuilding nations that are friendlier to the U.S., including Japan and South Korea. And both countries have seen an opening after Trump targeted Chinese-built ships. But through this merger, China is hoping to give its leading shipbuilder a boost, combining the two leading shipbuilders so that it can benefit from scale and in that way hope to retain its dominant position as well as to fend off a challenge coming from its East Asian neighbours. Journal reporter Clarence Leong, thank you so much. Thank you. General Electric and United Nuclear have agreed to a cleanup of uranium mine waste at sites in New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. The Justice Department said yesterday that the deal, estimated at $63 million, requires the companies to excavate and remove about one million cubic yards of uranium mine waste from the Navajo Nation site. The cleanup is expected to take more than a decade to complete. And photography company Eastman Kodak is warning that it may not be able to pay its current debt obligations as it tries to find savings by ending its retirement pension plan. Kodak reported a loss of $26 million for the April-June period, down from a profit of the same amount for that period last year. Once a household name in cameras and film, Kodak said it doesn't have committed financing all available liquidity to meet debts coming due within 12 months. Its stock was down more than 6% in off-hours trading. And that's it for What's News for this Tuesday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bark. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhoff.

### Trump Plans to Deploy the National Guard to D.C.
**Publication Date:** 2025-08-11T20:51:00
**Episode ID:** 5049

**Full Transcript:**
Hello and welcome to the Global Energy Transition podcast, presented by the Heinrich Boll Stiftung European Union and the Global Energy Transition blog. I am your host, Michael Buxbaum, photojournalist and lead blogger for theenergytransition.org. The international response to Russia's brutal February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has altered and transformed the energy transition, in some ways accelerating the move towards wind and solar generation, but also forcing countries dependent on Russian fossil fuels, particularly European nations and the European Union as a whole, to search for and secure alternative supplies. As our team of bloggers at the Energy Transition are broadly covering, the sudden shocks of this new reality largely exacerbated the already growing triple crisis of climate, energy and inflation that we continue to face. For decades, renewable energy proponents have advocated for the transformation of aging or abandoned coal mines and coal-fired power plants into green energy centers. After 200 plus years of industrialization, the reality is there are so many places worldwide where industry has moved on, leaving blighted brownfields in their wake. Once a source of greenhouse gases, many old mines and abandoned ones remain wired to the energy grid. Being granted a grid connection is increasingly becoming a challenge for new solar farms and green energy centers. Additionally, local opposition to building new power lines can be both costly and controversial. In that sense, closed mines and power plants are already tied to the grid and converting them rarely faces a challenge. What's more, these old industrial sites often still have substations which help convert electricity to a supply that's suitable for use in homes and businesses. After years of covering the international coal scene through about 2015 for a variety of industry publications, and in the process traveling to hundreds of coal mines and power plants and import and export facilities worldwide and spending far too much time underground, the coal conversion narrative is something that I have long been following. Colorado's Rocky Mount Institute, which had for decades advocated for such transformations, started tracking projects globally through their Sunshine for Mines initiative, publishing their first findings in 2015. In their first report, they listed the handful of such carbon reduction developments on mine sites worldwide, which, at the time, had only come to about 600 megawatts of cumulative capacity. I also first wrote about several lighthouse developments and the potential for more in 2015 in a pair of articles for both Mining Magazine and later Power Magazine following a trip I made to the pioneering Glenrock Wind Farm in the American state of Wyoming, the first wind farm to be constructed on reclaimed mine land. Located on the former Dave Johnston Surface Mine near Casper, Wyoming, walking along its rolling green high prairie land, you would never know that over the course of 42 years, over 104 million tons of coal have been extracted right there and burned nearby to produce electricity. After going into operation in 2008, Glenrock has grown to be a much larger wind farm now capable of producing almost 250 megawatts of clean power. A couple of years after the Glenrock facility was coming together, on the other side of the world, in Germany, a consortium of German and Chinese developers had proudly completed construction of an 11.6 megawatt solar farm on a former strip mine in central Germany. At the time, it was a pretty large coal-to-solar conversion. Now a decade later, developers not too far away from that first site are getting closer to completing a 650 megawatt coal-to-solar conversion, which may become the largest single solar farm in Germany when it starts producing in 2024. By 2019, RMI's list of coal conversions was just getting too long, as renewables on coal sites have begun generating almost 5 gigawatts worldwide. But now, a few years later, that's just a fraction of what's happening. Simply put, since 2008, coal production in the United States has more than halved, and outside of China and India, few other nations are still clinging to coal. And that downward trend, the International Energy Agency now says is becoming unstoppable. While we might like to think that this decline is only happening out of concern over the climate, there's actually a lot more at play, particularly geology. The reality is that after 200 years or so of mining, the easiest coal to reach is long gone, and the best of the rest is being mined every day, and thus a bit more depleted. Now for the most part, new studies show that what coal remains today is more expensive to mine, it's more expensive to transport, and thus more expensive to burn compared to the falling prices of new solar and wind generation. Combined with the rising costs of carbon credits in the EU or other regional regulations, for many countries and many electricity producers, there's simply less economic sense to stay with coal. However, what does make increasingly more economic sense is to reinvest in and repurpose abandoned, closed, or closing coal mines and power plants into renewable energy centers. And while energy developers had already been moving in this direction, Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the energy price shocks that followed have accelerated the coal to solar and renewables trend worldwide. Throughout the EU, converting coal mines and power plants into renewable energy sites became a key plank within the New Repower EU strategy adopted as a way to help speed the EU's move away from imported Russian gas and LNG. And the war has helped spur renewables development across the 27 member states. In 2022, for the first time, wind and solar reached over a fifth, 22%, of EU electricity generation. According to climate think tank Ember, the 41 gigawatts of new solar capacity that came online helped avoid some 10 billion euros in additional gas costs. And all that solar, plus new wind coming online coupled with a fall in electricity usage prevented a much larger return to coal throughout the EU. Looking ahead, solar and wind adoption is now moving so fast that the IEA says renewables will surpass coal's share around the globe by 2025. In cooperation with the NGO Europe Beyond Coal, during the summer of 2022, I conducted a really long survey of coal-to-wind and solar projects that were ongoing or had already happened throughout Europe. This led me to another fresh report on this subject, published by The Green Tank, an Athens-Greece-based environmental NGO, which looked through this subject through a just transitions lens. And so, for this episode of the Energy Transition Podcast, we're going to talk about this excitingly rapid uptake of new renewables and solar development on old or abandoned coal mining lands with one of the authors of The Green Tank's report, Nikos Montazaris. We'll link The Green Tank's report and several recent blogs I've written on coal-to-renewables into the show notes. These blogs, like all the material we publish, falls under a Creative Commons license and are therefore free for anyone to use, so long as you credit the material. Stay with us. Transitioning from coal to clean energy is a subject we've touched upon several times in our blogs and podcasts, such as in the Romanian Power Move series, where I covered how this Eastern European nation is planning to install solar arrays inside several state-owned lignite mines as part of its EU-funded energy transition. And more recently, we've written about how Colombia, South Africa, and other nations across the Global South are also developing coal-to-solar and wind projects. But one nation where new solar is rapidly being developed in and around existing coal operations is Greece. To help us get perspective on this surprisingly happy story, I spoke to Nikos Montazaris, partner and senior analyst with the environmental NGO Greentank, and one of the authors of their inspiring report, Just Transition in Practice, Sustainable Projects in Coal Regions. Now it's fair to say that this report, which details about 50 or so projects, is a bit Greek-heavy. But that makes sense when you realize how quickly developers are transforming the Greek region of Western Macedonia, the traditional lignite mining area of the country. Evidence of this? Last October, for several hours, the entire nation of Greece ran solely on renewables. And given how much new solar is coming online, the nation is now on track to reach its 2030 solar capacity target of 8 gigawatts by the end of this year, 2023, a full 7 years early. To open our conversation, I asked Nikos what prompted Greentank to research and publish this study. First of all, the motivation for this report was twofold. First, it's the fact that the development of the so-called territorial just transition plans, the prerequisites for getting funding for coal-region transition, member states getting funding for coal-region transition, this is progressing very slowly, and it's very opaque, mostly at the national but also the EU level. Thus, there is the threat of dangerous investments sneaking in and materializing at the expense of other much-needed projects that would benefit citizens of coal regions more. At the same time, there is the additional threat of delaying the just transition process even further because of all this planning for a temporary, as they say, comeback of coal in several EU member states. The second part for our motivation was that now we have a new energy reality and new challenging goals as expressed by the Repower EU plan. However, we don't have new funds. Thus, it's more urgent than ever to channel the funds of the just transition mechanism that the EU created for coal-region transition mainly, but other regions as well. And to channel these funds, the correct investments, in a fashion that is fully aligned with the Repower EU plan. For these two reasons, and in an effort to contribute towards truly sustainable territorial just transition plans, we researched the very rich just transition experience in the EU, especially as it was showcased in the coal-region transition platform established in 2018. We followed this very closely. This was later named just transition platform. What we did is we separated the sustainable projects and best practices that were presented there from the non-sustainable ones, and we presented them in seven categories. Sustainable, of course, a version of those that really take home message is that we have a lot of projects on the ground that are moving in the right direction, which shows that really just transition seems impossible, especially for citizens in coal regions. It's very, very doable, very possible if we put our minds together. I mean, there are excellent examples around the EU, which shows that the feasibility of just transition. The Green Tanks report reviews several case studies throughout the EU, though Greece gets quite a bit of attention, and rightly so. In mid-2022, Generation started at what at the time was the largest single PV plant in Southeastern Europe, the 204-megawatt Kozani project located in Western Macedonia. Built in large part by the Greek state-owned coal and electricity producer Public Power Company, or PPC, I asked Nikos to explain how Kozani has become something of a lighthouse project. To me, the lighthouse aspect of this project, again, is not the technology. A is the scale, 2.5 gigawatts out of a total of four already installed in Greece is a huge percentage, a huge share. But the most important aspect of this is the turnaround, the very silent and quiet turnaround of one of the dirtiest companies in Europe, the Public Power Corporation. In 2019, PPC was addicted to coal, was losing money of it, was addicted to coal, no plans for PVs, no plans for wind, etc. And they are planning on installing a huge amount of capacity until 2024, mainly in the United Regions, but not just in the United Regions. They want to invest there. They actually have signed three sustainability imports, a total amount of 1.275 billion euros, linked with very ambitious goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions from thermal plants. So they really are trying to put their money where their mouth is. They want to invest in renewables. This turnaround was the most impressive aspect of this, and lignite regions in Greece are right at the center of PPC's change of its energy model. I asked Nikos to put Greece's and Western Macedonia's Lignite to Renewables plan in context, describing why and how we got here. Yes, Western Macedonia is a key energy region for Greece. It has been burning lignite since the 1950s, so we're talking about seven decades of lignite use. It has reached the point in the late 90s and early 2000s where power from Western Macedonia covered approximately 70% of electricity needs in Greece. And if you include the other lignite regions in the south of Greece, then you would say that lignite had a share of 80% of electricity demand. Since the early 2010s, it became gradually apparent that the future of lignite in Greece was in jeopardy because it has very low quality and it's mostly influenced by any kind of change which has an economic effect because of the low quality of lignite. I'm talking about directives, the industrial emissions directive and the emissions trading system directive. This, essentially after the Paris Agreement, have really escalated. With other PV projects under construction, in early 2023, Greece's PPC secured an additional 100 million euros plus in financing to support the construction of another 230 megawatts of PV, also to be constructed in Western Macedonia near the operating Kozani plant. Though this project will also be financed in part by the European Union's Next Generation EU funds under the Recovery and Resilience Facility Plan, Greece 2.0, PPC will also be developing this PV project in partnership with friend of the podcast and German energy behemoth RWE, also known as Europe's most climate damaging company. Given how much criticism I and others give RWE, perhaps it's only fair that we also recognize when they are transitioning better, so to say. I asked Nikos about why PPC would choose to work with RWE in this situation. Yes, it's supposed to be close. We don't know exactly the site, by the way, but there are plans that RWE is going to collaborate with PPC to develop a one gigawatt PV panels, PV parks of a total capacity of one gigawatt. I think this is a wonderful idea. Though in the last three years, PPC has taken huge strides towards becoming a financially sound company by moving away from Ignite, loss making Ignite, and investing in Robos, it still does not have the capacity to do it all on its own, and it wants the help of bigger companies such as RWE. That is why RWE is co-developing with PPC this one gigawatt of solar in Western Macedonia, because PPC needs the help. Back in Germany, of the various solar projects now being built on former mine land, one is a huge 650 megawatt facility, enough to power 200,000 average households. News reports show it's on track to begin generating by the end of 2023. I asked Nikos about the relationship between Kozani and these types of German projects. Well, I would definitely highlight Kozani, because it's truly, truly impressive. There are existing and much older projects around the EU. Germany is another very good example, but then of course, Germany. For Germany, this is not that pioneering because it has been pioneering PVs since the 2010s. Germany is largely responsible for having those low prices globally, so it's not a big surprise that Germany is installing large PVs in Ignite mines. I consider this a given, whereas in Greece, where we have around four gigawatts of PV capacity to install more than 2.5 gigawatts just in two mining sites, that's far more impressive. Would you say that these are all projects that could become models for other areas too? Yes, I would say that these are kind of lighthouse projects, in my opinion, and particularly suitable for Ignite regions, not just in Greece, but other coal regions, Ignite regions in particular, with open pit mines in Europe. What about reusing and redeveloping existing coal-fired power plants into batteries or thermal storage centers? Thermal storage is a different technology where you exploit the pre-existing infrastructure that otherwise is going to be demolished or left unused, etc. You can use this very rich infrastructure that does not only involve the turbines, it involves also the grid connecting the Ignite plant with everything, but use it for storage purposes. So that, I would say, is a very good example of what can be used in coal regions, and it's common, I would say, in Ignite mining regions across the EU. To convert Ignite plants to thermal energy storage facilities is really an option. And last but not least, you keep jobs in the Ignite industry, which is a main prerequisite of any process, any just transition process in any country in the world, in reality, because you keep all the jobs you have in the Ignite plant, plus other jobs for the storage sector. Of course, you miss the Ignite mining jobs, we're not claiming otherwise, but still to keep a significant amount of jobs in the Ignite industry is very, very good. Nikos, you're like another oracle from Delphi. Hey, thanks for sharing all this with our audience today. Thank you very much. It was a pleasure. It was a pleasure. Bye bye. Since Nikos and I spoke, coal to solar and renewable developments around the world have continued to take off. Before we end the show, I'm going to detail just a few more. As I said at the top of the pod, I've been covering coal mining and energy for decades, starting from when I was a grad student working for a coal research center in the U.S. state of Illinois around 2000 or so. At the time, Illinois, which has the most coal reserves of any U.S. state, was experiencing a mining and burning resurgence. Now, some 20 years later, across Illinois, at least nine major coal-fired power plants are on track to become solar farms and battery storage facilities over the next three years. Also, while I was a grad student in 2002, I had the chance to study in the coal mining regions of eastern Czech Republic and Ostrava, and while I was there, I visited several of its super deep coal mines. Since then, many of these plants or mines have closed, leaving behind the question of what to do with their infrastructure. Recently, a deal was struck between the Diamo, the Czech state-owned company tasked with mitigating the consequences of the country's mines, and a U.K.-based underground energy storage company, Gravitricity, to convert the closed Darkov coal complex into a storage and hydrogen and solar hub. Renamed Eden Silesia, Gravitricity hopes to transform a Darkov mine into the first full scale gravity energy storage site in Europe, while also constructing a PV power plant there with an eye towards eventual green hydrogen generation. Gravitricity estimates that worldwide there are around 14,000 mines which could be similarly suitable for gravity energy storage. At the same time, on virtually the other side of the globe, the nation of Bangladesh just announced it's seeking partners to build out a series of solar power plants on ponds created from decades of extraction, including to start at a mine in the Dinjapur district. According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board officials, this project alone has the capacity to host a floating solar power plant with up to 50 megawatts of capacity. Staying in Bangladesh, the Singapore-based energy developer Sembcorp has announced plans to deploy more than 400 megawatts of solar PV at another coal facility near Cox's Bazaar. Do note, nationwide all across Bangladesh, the country only has less than 960 megawatts of renewable capacity, meaning these two projects alone will nearly double it as greenhouse gas emissions otherwise keep rising. All of this is welcome progress. You have been listening to the Energy Transition podcast, a part of the Heinrich Boll Stiftung's Energy Transition platform. We'd like to thank the Energy Transition team in the EU office in Brussels, including editor Lisa Santner, digital coordinator Joan Lonfranco, as well as program head Martin Keim for his guidance. And of course, we can end this podcast without a huge shout out once again to our amazing producer, the sound guru, carnival king of Dusseldorf and bellowing bassist Christian Kreimborg. From the former German capital city of Bonn, I wish you all smooth sailing on what could be rough seas ahead. Until next time.

### What's News in Earnings: Why Some Money Managers Are Trailing the Market
**Publication Date:** 2025-08-11T16:00:00
**Episode ID:** 5050

**Full Transcript:**
Hello and welcome to the Global Energy Transition podcast presented by the Heinrich Boll Stiftung European Union and the Global Energy Transition blog. I am your host, Michael Buxbaum, photojournalist and lead blogger for theenergytransition.org. The international response to Russia's brutal February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has altered and transformed the energy transition, in some ways accelerating the move towards wind and solar generation, but also forcing countries dependent on Russian fossil fuels, particularly European nations and the European Union as a whole, to search for and secure alternative supplies. As our team of bloggers at the Energy Transition are broadly covering, the sudden shocks of this new reality largely exacerbated the already growing triple crisis of climate, energy, and inflation that we continue to face. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the EU, which relies heavily on imported fossil fuels. 70% of its coal, 90% of its gas, and 97% of its oil are mined and produced from outside the 27-member nation bloc. And as Putin's tanks began rolling into Ukraine late last February, Russia had long become not only Europe's biggest supplier of gas, providing just under half its total gas needs, it also provided over 40% of its oil and nearly half of its coal too. And Germany had become particularly dependent on Russian imports. As late as 2021, Russian supplies accounted for over 55% of its gas, 35% of its oil, and 45% of its coal too. Worse, revenues derived from these fossil fuels were, and to a lesser extent continue to be, the largest sources of income for Russia's war machine. To halt this indirect funding, since the invasion began, the EU and Germany have taken monumental steps to reduce their Russian energy dependency. While this was a bit easier to achieve with coal, replacing Russian oil and petroleum products was much more challenging. Even more difficult was replacing Russian gas and liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Mainly used for electricity generation and industrial purposes, like producing plastics, packaging, chemicals, and fertilizers, as late as 2021, fossil gas was also used by some 30% of EU households to heat their homes. To make up for sanctioned Russian supplies, Germany delayed planned coal unit retirements, reduced gas demand, and spurred on renewables growth, which all across the EU hit a record level. But with energy prices rising, Germany's government leapt into action, prioritizing the deployment of new floating LNG terminals, and authorizing the construction of new permanent LNG facilities, and also by making a slew of new deals ensuring a diverse basket of new energy suppliers and infrastructure pathways. And that's what we're going to cover in this episode. Germany's dizzyingly quick greenlighting, building, and opening up of not one new LNG terminal, where prior to the war there had been none, but a whole new fleet of LNG ports. To guide us through this complex narrative, for this podcast we spoke with the tireless energy campaigner and consultant, Andy Georgiou. Based in Germany, Andy is a former public servant and policy advisor to Food and Water Watch Europe. Today, he works as a consultant with a variety of local, national, and international organizations like the Global Oil and Gas and Beyond Gas Networks, as well as the Break Free from Plastics movement, helping to lead campaigns around fracking, plastic pollution, expanding pipelines and fossil fuels infrastructure, as well as LNG and global warming. Since 2020, Andy has also contributed about a dozen blogs to the energy transition on LNG, methane, as well as the gas industry's plastic push. We'll link several of these into the show notes. Andy's blogs, like all of the materials we publish, fall under a Creative Commons license and are therefore free for anyone to use, so long as you credit the material. Stay with us. Listeners may recall that prior to the war, constructing any LNG terminals in Germany had become highly contentious, and to an extent, by the time of elections and a new government coming in at the end of 2021 and early 2022, terminal permitting had sort of frozen. This was partially due to the efforts of campaigners like Andy, who had long worked to prevent more fossil gas lock-ins, while at the same time, the oil and gas industry, as supporters, have also been pushing, long trying to sell fossil gas as a cleaner option for the environment compared to coal. The main argument is that when you burn gas and you compare it to coal, when you look at the CO2 emissions, it is indeed much more climate friendly. But the problem is that when you do look at gas versus coal only at the combustion stage, then it looks greener. And this was always the excuse for the industry to push for more fossil gas infrastructure to basically secure their fossil fuel business as usual, so gas was more or less their only avenue. Coal was already dirty, oil wasn't that clean, they pushed for gas as this so-called clean bridge into the post-fossil future. But the problem starts with the emissions along the full supply chain of gas. Starting 10 years ago, we do have now quite a list of scientific evidence, we do have much better data, satellite data, but also field studies that prove that along the full supply chain of gas, we do have quite a high rate of methane leakages. So fossil gas consists mainly of methane. And if methane is being released into the atmosphere, it is up to 108 times much more climate damaging, meaning that it has up to 108 times higher global warming impact than CO2. This is when you look at it for a 20-year time frame. Beyond supposedly being better for the climate, gas supporters have also touted it as a cheaper alternative to more expensive, unproven, or risky investments in renewables. Remember that as you look at your electricity bills. Were it not for that record build-out of new wind and solar last year, they'd be much higher. But seeing a renewables build-out as a threat to their profits, the oil and gas industry has long been lobbying to slow down any sort of more ambitious action there. And also, since we've mostly been focusing on the climate crisis through the lens of carbon dioxide pollution and not holistically taking in all different types of greenhouse gases like methane, we've missed an important point. Methane, which makes up about 85% of what industry calls or terms natural gas, which is really fossil gas from methane. Methane itself is way more heat trapping than CO2. What's worse, current science says that if just 3-5% of all the methane that's being extracted today to make natural gas escapes into the atmosphere, then gas itself loses whatever purported climate advantage it ever had over burning coal. There are several studies out there and several numbers. And yes, the threshold is more or less 3%, but we had studies that showed that sometimes it can be up to 12%, up to 17%. Scientists like Professor Howers, who's at Cornell University, one of the first scientists together with his colleague, Anthony Ingrafia, who raised this issue and said there's a problem with methane. He came up with estimates saying that, and this is even conservative, along the full supply chain of shakers, for example, we can estimate a methane leakage rate that is higher than 4%. So, yeah, you have a very broad variety of methane emissions leakage rates, but it looks as if they're definitely not under 3% or at least in some fields. This means that we should completely rethink the climate impact of gas. And apart from this pure scientific debate, no one ever talked about the fact that if you add fossil infrastructure to an existing network, it has a certain economic lifespan. And a lot of the projects that have been pushed within the last 10 years, some of them came online a few years ago, but they do have an economic lifespan of 30, sometimes 50 years, meaning that this goes way beyond 2050 when we need to be at net zero, which shows us that the industry is making use of this misconception to install fossil infrastructure that will cause a fossil lock-in because we might be forced to keep this infrastructure online in order to prevent stranded assets. Going back to February 2022 and the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, Germany really was upside down in terms of its dependence on Russian gas. To swiftly free itself and also enable the country to directly receive LNG volumes from producers the world over, Berlin floated the idea of securing a fleet of, well, floating LNG terminals while simultaneously reviving some of the LNG projects which had been languishing ahead of the war. And now, with the crisis upon them, Berlin, one can assume with lots of industry encouragement, decided to move at lightning speed, especially by German standards, to develop new terminals. When I started the Climate Against LNG campaign and alliance, we had three main locations and we talked about three LNG terminals. And one of them was at least almost dead, the one at Wilhelmshaven, because Uniper actually opted for no longer pursuing with a fossil project, but rather looking into alternatives. So back then we had three locations and three proposed terminals with another one, but this was really a small-scale terminal in Rostock. These are onshore terminals and also so-called floating storage units, FSRUs. They can be built on five locations so far. So we still have three main locations that are still in the race Hunsbüttel, Wilhelmshaven and Stade, but we also have now Hamburg and also Lubmin on the list. And you can find the terminals and also the locations in the annex of the so-called LNG fast-tracking law. So the German parliament pushed this law through the parliament and Bundestag and the Bundesrat also approved it. And it not only torpedoes massively public participation rights, it completely skips the environmental impact assessments for their floating storage units. So they don't have to do an environmental impact assessment any longer and they can get permits until 2043. So there we are. Note to listeners, since I taped this show with Andy, the LNG terminal plan has changed several times. As of the end of February 2023, a total of 10 new terminals under the LNG Acceleration Act, which Andy mentions, are already operating or are in various stages of development. Of the proposed three fixed terminals, as of the end of 2022, no final investment decisions on these have been made. However, a total of three floating terminals are now in operation, including one in Brunsbüttel and another in Wilhelmshaven, which received its first full load of LNG from the US at the beginning of 2023, after going into operation just weeks before. And a third FSRU has gone online in Lubmin, the eastern port where the now inoperable Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia makes landfall. This LNG can then fill Nord Stream's intended onshore network. And for this reason, two more floating units are also planned to come online in Lubmin by the end of 2023, as well as more floating units in Wilhelmshaven and Stade near the giant port of Hamburg. As we finalize this podcast, there is yet another growing fight brewing about one other planned floating LNG terminal, this time set for the otherwise touristy island of Rügen, one of Germany's most popular holiday destinations. Recently, the Federal Cabinet in Berlin decided to include the planned terminal in the port of Mukron on Rügen into the LNG Acceleration Act, citing the need for even more secure energy supplies. However, authorities in the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where Mukron is situated, have requested more time to consider alternatives to Berlin's plans as they attempt to gain local acceptance. Regardless, our friends at the energy behemoth RWE have stated that they will not take part in development plans in Rügen. Instead, the government-owned Deutsche Energy Terminal, GmbH, will handle commercial operations at this planned FSRU-based LNG terminal, along with Deutsche Regas, instead of RWE. The German Environmental Aid Group, or Deutsche Umwelthilfe, along with other campaigners are charging that the federal government and the responsible authorities have so far refrained from involving citizens in the planning process. They fear that this LNG project would pose far-reaching dangers to tourism, people, and nature while placing Germany's legally binding climate targets at risk. Using German Federal Economic Ministry documents, as well as planning applications by friend of the pod, the energy behemoth RWE, a new analysis by the Argus Media Network reports that Germany is on track to construct over 70 million tons of peak annual LNG capacity by 2030. If this happens, they write, Germany would then have the world's fourth-largest LNG capacity behind South Korea, China, and Japan. Throughout 2022, as gas importers and producers in Germany's government scrambled to find alternative supplies, prices for gas and LNG kept rising along with industry profits. And though virtually the whole industry started rolling in the dough, one set of producers and one country clearly emerged as the EU's new big fossil energy supplier. Well, there's definitely one big winner in the house, and that's the US. Make America great again, make the frackers great again. And since July 2018, US LNG exports increased by 2,240%. And this is as of February 2022. So this means before the war started. And they are still increasing. There's a new deal. US is supposed to deliver more LNG until 2030. And so, again, to cut a long story short, there's one huge big winner, and that's the U.S. Yeah, certainly from an industry perspective, the U.S. sector is enjoying this situation. According to a new report by Greenpeace, which we'll link into the show notes, today no country supplies more LNG to Europe than the United States of America. The import of so-called freedom gas began in 2016 during the Obama era, and then really took off under the Trump administration. So as Andy mentioned, from 2018 through 2022, US LNG exports into Europe and the UK increased by an incredible 1,700%, 1,767% to be exact, according to Greenpeace. And that import of so-called freedom gas just surged all throughout 2022. Just weeks after Russia's invasion began, US President Joe Biden promised that he'd send Europe 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the bloc, to the EU, before 2030, a massive increase over the years prior. And by golly, by year's end, the U.S. had made good on this pledge, shipping over 56 billion cubic meters in the year, way ahead of that 2030 target. New data reveals that U.S. companies provided over 44% of Europe's LNG supplies in 2022, along with at least 12% of its oil. This led to record profits for U.S. majors ExxonMobil and Chevron, as well as LNG suppliers Chenier and Freeport, well, really almost all industry players. And looking ahead, as new ports get built and come online, the U.S. is now on track to become the world's largest LNG shipper by the end of this year. Though Germany's complete about-face regarding LNG provides a strong example for how even a three-party coalition government can swiftly react to a perceived emergency, it does seem that in the face of such an economic challenge, climate protection has become something of a luxury. Yeah, I fully agree. And what really saddens me is that, especially in Germany, we've wasted precious months where we could have had renewable energy, energy efficiency, small-scale subsidy programs, acceleration legal frameworks, but instead we got the LNG Acceleration Act, which allows fossil LNG infrastructure to get permits until 2043. There's no environmental impact assessment for the floating storage units, and this leads to partially very bizarre scenarios where, even if you skip the climate aspects aside, we do have a recent case at Wilhelmshaven where the now state-owned energy company Uniper, which is, by the way, a huge Russian profiteer, let's not forget that, they are applying now to get a permit for an FSIU, which was denied permitting by the government of Victoria in Australia last year because it will inject huge amounts of chlorine, which is a biocide, for the regasification process. And this should happen in the protected UNESCO World Heritage Warranty. Just to clarify, Andy's talking about how, despite other nations like Australia rejecting permits for FSRUs, Germany greenlit several of them. This speaks to the risks being authorized to ensure supply security. And in this desperate market, new gas might start flowing from some surprising sources. It's not surprising, but what is worrying is that there's a dash for African gas. And there's a push to actually even subsidize fossil fuel slash gas projects in Africa. And this really worries me because I know from experience that African countries, and I can say that for Southern Africa, Namibia, for example, they have a huge potential for renewables, but they lack infrastructure and the people are poor and energy prices are high, which is, it's absurd. They have the potential. The only thing they're lacking is a bit of technology and a bit of help. So instead of working with African countries as legitimate partners, we are falling into this new colonialism behaviors and are actually trying to make Africa also much more dependent from fossil fuels, which is quite suicidal if we think of the global warming apocalypse that is looming. I mean, Gutierrez was talking about the highway to climate health in his opening speech at the COP this year, which takes place in Africa. Clearly Andy doesn't buy the premise of this new real energy politic that's securing alternative sources of gas and LNG from the U.S., Qatar, and various African producers, despite inherent climate risks is the best strategy. Global warming and its impacts in terms of billions and trillions in loss, in terms of millions and billions of lives being lost, this is a reality and you have to act according to this reality and not completely past orientated economic model that is profiting only a few people in companies worldwide that have made their income based on the moment that we're in. They have created these crisis by what they're doing. So they could have reacted in a real way to this reality by doing exactly the opposite of what they've done. Come up with a climate emergency acceleration bill first, instead of an LNG acceleration bill without any kind of profound assessment, if you actually need all these LNG terminals and without any kind of climate assessment, what this would mean in terms of global emissions that you are actually responsible for because of your hunger that is for as a large part, it is not even the hunger of households for energy, but is the hunger of an energy and raw materials intensive petrochemical and plastics industry, because this is also an aspect that we've revealed this year, maybe a truth, not really a surprise, but maybe a surprise in numbers. And I also wrote a blog about it. A lot of oil and gas is going into non-essential toxic products produced by the petrochemical and plastics industry and includes players such as BASF. So they could have focused on that and we could have done other measures to make sure that people are not freezing or that we relieve them from paying these high prices. Opting for LNG is opting for high gas prices. Exact figures are not available, but new estimates as to how much fossil gas is actually used to produce only single use plastics and disposable packaging are shocking. A great researcher, his name is Amadeo Giotto. He works for BaFin, but in this case, he worked together with the Break Free from Plastic movement. He has done some great research around how much oil and gas goes into plastics in Europe. He used Eurostat data and according to his research, 9% of the overall gas consumption in Europe goes into plastics. Some 14-15% goes into petrochemicals. If we zoom into the plastic sector, which is by the way, and this was also a surprise this year because of this research, we found out that plastic production is the largest industrial consumer of oil and gas. It's larger than steel, larger than machinery, food, beverages and stuff. One very easy thing that our governments could do and in actual fact, they committed themselves to do this through the safe gas for a safe winter proposal of the European Commission, member states have committed themselves to reduce gas consumption by 15% between August 22 and March 23. One thing that they could do is send energy intensive industries into lockdown. One of them would be the petrochemical and plastic production industry and ramp up programs that focus on reuse and recycling instead of continuing producing basically plastic waste because 40% of the plastic market is packaging and packaging is nothing but waste at the end of the day. Instead of asking people to shower cold and heat less, they could and should focus on plastic, which is nothing but oil and gas in a solid form. These measures would actually be popular because you will basically use something that is already a bad thing in the eye of the public. People are aware of the fact that the plastic waste is a problem. So why not focusing on plastic before doing anything else? There's a huge potential to reduce oil and gas consumption and also dependency from Russian oil and gas by reducing plastic production and plastic consumption. Wow, mind blowing. Andy, I want to ask you so many more questions, but we're running out of time. So let's just stop here. And let me thank you again for your insights and dedication. And of course, for coming on to the pod. Thanks, Michael. Thank you. And thank you to all your listeners who've tuned in and stayed tuned in. You have been listening to the Energy Transition Podcast, a product of the Heinrich Boll Stiftung's Energy Transition platform.

### How Small Businesses Can Fight a Growing Wave of Cyber Crime
**Publication Date:** 2025-08-10T10:00:00
**Episode ID:** 5052

**Full Transcript:**
Hello and welcome to the second season of the Global Energy Transition podcast, presented by the Heinrich-Boll Stiftung European Union and the Global Energy Transition blog. I am your host, Michael Buxbaum, lead blogger, photojournalist, and advisor to theenergytransition.org. Last season, we looked at how the energy transition was developing around the world, but Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and the international response to it has altered and largely weaponized the energy transition, the whole of which has now morphed into something like a global energy crisis. This toxic combination, now imposed onto an ever-worsening climate emergency, is in some ways slowing and in other ways accelerating our vital clean and renewable energy transition. As fossil gas and coal prices soar, solar and wind energy prices remain stable at zero. Study after study shows that building new solar and new wind capacity is still cheaper than building new fossil fuels or building new nuclear, and it's cheaper both short-term and long-term. For this second season, though, we are going to shine a spotlight on this triple crisis of climate, energy, and inflation that we now face, and discuss and show how these challenges are intertwined and affecting communities worldwide. Like the blogs we publish, all our materials fall under a Creative Commons license and are therefore free for anyone to use, so long as you credit the material. As the climate crisis envelops us, we intend for this podcast series to inform listeners about other additional tools being developed to deal with what's ahead. Though we may not be in the same boats, we all face the same gathering storm. Energy prices, inflation, and emissions are rising along with our thermostats. To open our second season, we are going to train our gaze and focus on a nation that today finds itself playing a surprisingly key role in supplying European countries, particularly Germany, with a replacement for Russian coal and other fossil fuels, the Latin American nation of Colombia. Brimming with vital biodiversity, jungles, and forests, this Andean nation is also rich in natural resources. Rich being somewhat in quotation marks or air quotes, because while inside the national borders that land holds vast stores of hard coal, oil, and fossil gas, the wealth these fossil fuels bring are not at all being evenly divided amongst the population, not even close. In fact, with the exception of a select few, given that some 98% of Colombia's coal, oil, and gas is exported, the extraction and development of this wealth is or has largely immiserated much of Colombia's 51 million people, sowing violence, lawlessness, and decades of cocaine-fueled civil war. Though a fragile peace exists today, it's very uncertain if or for how long this will last. As of early August, the nation is embarking on a whole new chapter as the new left-wing government led by Gustavo Petro and Francia Marquez seems set to create a sea change of how Colombia's mostly foreign-owned extraction companies can or will mine or will be permitted to mine or extract oil and coal and gas, and, going forward, who will benefit from these activities. As the new government introduces land reform measures and increases corporate taxes, it intends to move forward with an aggressive clean energy transition, constructing and expanding wind and solar generation. However, this green development is set to happen in many of the same regions where coal mining is happening today, impacting the same indigenous and Afro-Colombian populations who have been most affected by decades of strip mining and forced land grabs. And though the new Petro government may want to reduce fossil fuel development and eventually phase it out completely, the economic reality is that the nation of Colombia is deeply in debt and selling off those fossil fuels is one of the few ways they have to service and reduce those foreign debts. And now, given the triple crisis we are in, even as the coal, oil and gas mined and extracted from beneath Colombia's lands and waters is fetching record prices, the cost for everything else including food, medicine and other necessities is also rising, forcing some really hard choices onto an already impatient population. Adding more pressure, as Europe, specifically Germany, actively shuns and moves away from Russian fossil fuels, its coalition government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the centrist SPD party, has reversed course and is now, despite the acknowledged human rights abuses that clearly makes Colombian coal blood coal, back in April of this year, Scholz personally called the previous president of Colombia the much more business friendly Ivan Duque and announced that Germany was going to need that coal after all and would like to start reshipments in massive quantities as soon as possible. For this episode, the first of two that we will have on Colombia, we interview the Spanish-German journalist Judith Alonso who has written extensively for Deutsche Welle Español and other outlets about Colombia's coal mines, the impacts of mining there and fossil fuel extraction and how activists on both sides of the Atlantic have been trying to change or stop what has become an increasingly toxic relationship. Stay tuned. Judith, thanks so much for coming on the show and giving us your sense of what's going on in Colombia. Let's just dive right in, please bring us up to speed. Thanks for inviting me. This is an interesting topic because Colombia is right now one of the countries in Latin America that it seems that is doing more efforts in this energy transition, but of course it has also problems and one of the biggest problems is coal. The thing is that I thought Colombia is not using this coal that is producing in the north of the country in this area called La Guajira. It's selling most of the part of its production to another country, one of them Germany. The thing is that energy is that they are using in the country is more focused in hydro, but since some years ago they start to develop more renewable energies. So also this area La Guajira is powerful in sun and wind, but the thing is that in this area there are indigenous people living there, call it Guayu. So they have now to deal between conflicts that this coal mine is producing since 40 years ago that they start the activity in this area. And now with other projects that the government is pushing to do in this area, as I told you, there's a lot of power in sun and wind. Thank you for that. I think there's just so much background here that we need to kind of wade through for a moment. So from a geological perspective, Colombia's coal is really good. I mean, if you're a coal burner, right? And one of Colombia's biggest markets is Europe. And previously one of its biggest users in Europe was Germany. So though Germany has moved forward with its own coal exit, despite whatever bump or spike in generation that's happening now as a response to what's happening in Ukraine and Russia, Germany however, did stop the mining of hard coal here, but they didn't stop the burning of that hard coal. So that just means they need to import it from somewhere else. And in the more recent past, quite a bit of that coal was coming from Colombia, specifically from the El Cerrojon mine or the monster as it's called the mine. This is the largest open cast mine in Latin America. It's owned by the Swiss mining and commodities trader, Glencore, which posted nearly $19 billion in profits for the first half of 2022. That's more than double last year's profits during this time. And it's almost all because of these insanely high coal prices. So though Germany had previously more or less stopped importing Colombian coal precisely because of the human rights problems associated with it, and instead turned to Russian coal. Great job, previous governments. As we fear now of freezing this winter, it seems like at least here in Germany, we'll burn just about anything we can get a hold of. So now, Judith, as you were saying, the area around El Cerrojon and a lot of the other mines is, of course, lived in by various peoples, particularly the Wayuu people, which is the largest indigenous group in the region. And literally, they're the ones who are being directly affected by this mining. Could you go back to and talk a bit more about how the Wayuu people are being directly impacted by the mining that's taking place around them? No, the thing is that if we see now how the area changes these past years, there are some studies that show that at the beginning, agriculture has a quite strong activity here. But since 2000 and since now, coal and gas are the main activities in this area. And the thing also that to do this, to produce coal, do you need a lot of water? So this is one of the most problems that these Wayuu people has, that they had a kind of a small river that was not so far from its community. But with the activities of the mine, the direction of this water changes. So they start not to have problems to have access to this water. But also as they are using the resources that they have in this area, in land and rivers, it's also difficult also to fish. Then there's a lot of conflicts in this sense. And also as they, in Latin America, they have, well, the companies that want to do a project, they have this, they must do a consultation to ask the communities or to present the communities their plans or the things that they will do this. So it's an article of ILO, the 169. So that in Spanish it says that a consulta previa informada. So this is something that they didn't do. So there are discussions with the company and this topic also, this issue was also in the tribunals. And there are several actions against the coal mine, but it's always difficult to get the actions that this company compromised to do to mitigate their activity in this area. And the thing is that, yes, there is now this discourse with Germany that they don't want to use the gas from Russia because it's because not with all these crises with Ukraine, but they are using coal from Colombia, but they say coal is produced with violation of human rights of these communities. So there is a series of compounding events that are hurting the way you people who are affected not only by El Cerrojon, but also other mines, including mines owned by the US-based Drummond Corporation, which have also been linked to several murders of labor or environmental activists. But the mining companies, as well as both the government and several other organizations have also long been accused or been found guilty by various courts of bribery or involvement with illegal or guerrilla and paramilitary activities. And all manner of civil rights and human rights violations are sort of toxics too, right? Exactly. The thing is that Colombia is, the thing is that the most important issue in this energy transition or cutting emissions in Colombia, we can say like this, the thing is that the most part of the emissions that Colombia is producing is for deforestation. So the thing is that, yes, of course, they want to also to change this model and to get out of the fossil fuels. But the thing is that in this case, to cut emissions, they have to deal with fighting against the deforestation. But, and this is one of the biggest issues in their strategy for 2050 to be a carbon neutral country, that this is a plan that not a lot of countries in Latin America have done because it's only Costa Rica, Chile and Panama that, and after right now, Colombia, they announced with President Iván Duque, he present this strategy at COP26 in Glasgow. And the thing is this, so deforestation, to cut the deforestation is one of the biggest things that they have to do to achieve this compromise. And after also not to expand this energy capacity and not focus only in hydro, that as I told you before, it's the most important part or the most important source and try to do other projects, link it with sand and wind. So this area, as we say before, is quite rich in these two sources. But for example, in transport, like electricity buses, Colombia is one of the most advanced countries in the region. And for example, with cities like Bogota, Medellín, with a lot of electric buses running. Yes, so they are doing this exercise at the same time. They are in the way. But the thing is this, that to do this energy transition, at least in this area, they must also to be account the people that is living there. So they must assure that this transition is a social justice. This then is the second part of this tragedy. As Colombia goes ahead with its own clean energy transition, unfortunately, some of the best wind and solar resources are located exactly in the same region where the YU are already being impacted by coal mining. So how are they responding to this now? Are they protesting this? So the thing is that since a long time ago, they are doing this kind of actions against this coal mine and putting this topic in justice hands. But yes, it's a long process that takes time and they had some answers from the coal mine company and this company must do some actions to mitigate the activity there. But the thing is that also that this area, it's quite poor. It's in like a half a deserted area. So they feel like the government is not taking care of them. And it's like they are in a rural area, although they have all these rich resources, they don't feel that the government helped to develop them. And they, for example, they have this problem with water. That is something basic for the daily life and we saw it during the pandemic. We needed to wash our hands to like one of the basic rules to not be affected of this virus. But they don't have neither this basic resource. So you're saying that the villages around the Cerrojon mine don't necessarily even have running water or access to running water? Exactly. So the company has to provide water with people that are going there and giving some water to daily use. How much of the land in Colombia is actually being legally protected? How much is being protected from further exploitation? So the thing is that the protection, the natural protection areas in Colombia, it's also a big issue that the new government has to take care of because Colombia has a lot of natural national parks that they are quite rich with biodiversity. We must remember that Colombia is one of the 10 most biodiversity countries in the world. So there is also areas that you can find Amazonian forests there. So the thing is that deforestation is one of the most important problems, environmental problems there. And a lot of this deforestation is happening in this, that normally the government is taking care. The thing is this, that there is also, they have a lot of space, a lot of land and marine areas protected, but after they don't have the resources to guarantee that these areas are protected, in fact. So as all this economic activity, primarily coal mining, is deforesting the lands, as this occurs, the Colombian government, you're saying, is trying to protect these parks, these protected spaces by putting forth legislation and new laws that in theory could protect them from further development, but it's really difficult to enforce them. Is that what you're saying? Exactly. So anyway, you have to remember that there is in these parks or the areas that are around these parks, yes, there is also this problem with coca, coca. Coca production, meaning producing cocaine, correct? Exactly. And the thing is this, for example, I was talking yesterday, I was with some people that they were doing this activity that right now they are in a project that is supported by the German government that they change the coca for cacao. So this activity, they are cutting deforestation, but this kind of project takes a lot of time because it's this, as I told you, these rural areas have been abandoned and the government was not entering in these areas because there was these paramilitary groups, narco groups also. So the people were living there, they were doing this activity as a way to earn money for these people, no? But the thing is that some of them, they start to change their mind and to see that this is also, coca also, it's a kind of crop that it takes a lot of space and it's like extractivism of the earth. So they saw that with the cacao, they can cut deforestation and they can also cover degraded lands and also this kind of crops helps also to do conservation of the species that are living there. So there are more advantages than with coca crop. Coca production. So at the end of the day, what we're saying is that the German government or other governments are asking folks or helping to support folks in Colombia to stop producing coca or cocaine but instead produce other crops which are less environmentally impactful. But then you also have the fact that the coal mines are using up a tremendous amount of water which is in scarce supply. And then there's a third problem with water as well as land, which is that there is an ongoing attempt to introduce fracking to Colombia because Colombia has a lot of fossil gas or methane resources. And what is the status of fracking now, Judith? Where are we? Where is the new government going to go with this? And what do you see coming out of this? Okay. So fracking, it's something also quite polemic since, and it was because this, no? Because the government is saying that they are pushing for this energy transition. In fact, the last Berlin Energy Dialogue transitions, the people from government speaking here talking about green hydrogen to produce. But the thing is, this is at the international level, no? Because at the national level, they are pushing for this other project that it makes no sense what they are explaining at the rest of the world. So these fracking projects, they start to do a kind of pilots, but it seems that with the new government, with Gustavo Petro, they will stop it. Because one of the things that he say during this political campaign is that he wants to really stop climate change and to really push the energy transition in Colombia. Let's break that down a bit for our listeners. We're recording this just ahead of the new government coming into power in early August. So as the Duque government leaves power and the new government comes in, can you talk a little bit more about this major political sea change that's about to take place? The new government of Gustavo Petro represents quite a radical departure. Can you explain this a little bit more? Yeah, of course. The main thing is that this new president that is coming at the 7th of August, he is a quite known person in Colombia because he was voted mayor some years ago, but because also he was also linked with guerrillas in the past. So these elections were quite polemical because, yes, there is some part of the population that are not agree with him. But finally, in this election, the rural areas and the areas that the government was not taking care of during the past years really did the difference. And because they really collect all these votes that finally give the chance to Gustavo Petro to be president of Colombia. And he's with the vice president. It's a woman, that is Francia Marquez, that is also quite a popular person in these areas because she's a black woman, that she represents this Afro community and women, but also rural. And she was involved in environmental issues in the past. She won this Goldman Prize award some years ago. So there is a nice match between these two people. And the thing that they are, they were pushing with environment, social and justice issues during all the campaign. Everything that is linked with taking care of the environment and conservation and trying to do social justice is things that we expect that they will do during this new government. The new government is coming in then as the long civil war has ended. But is it still simmering? I mean, how does reform play into his campaign? One of the points of Gustavo Petro campaign was to implement this peace agreement. The article one, for example, is linked with the fact of giving land to people that has not access. Also with implementing this article, you are also decreasing deforestation. Sounds like a win on all levels. But ahead of the transition to the new Petro government, Germany's Schultz led coalition and Schultz himself did reach out again personally to the more industry friendly Duque to say secure more energy supplies, especially coal. Right. So Germany right now with all these Russian crisis is looking forward to how to save the winter that is coming. So I think they are a little bit desperate, but we will say that they are not looking which countries can be the partners to do this. Because Colombia is providing all this coal to Germany. They are trying to push what can be other options. So there is also an interest to develop renewable energies there. And there was some discussions some weeks ago with people from cooperation departments. This is something that I see that I think that we will see in the next months. Because for Germany, Colombia is one of the most important partners in this sense. Not only because at the international cooperation level also, as I told you, this project that I explained about to change cocoa for cacao is supported, funded by the German government. Exactly. And the thing is that it's not the only one. They have quite a lot of projects to conserve or preserve the Amazonian forest. So on the one level, there is all this international funding to protect Colombia's environment. On the other hand, Colombia is a major swing supplier of coal for European other markets. So you mentioned the civil war a few moments ago, which was obviously very bloody. And though it has largely ended, Colombia is still one of the most dangerous places to report from and to be an activist in, particularly around environmental and labor issues. Could you talk a bit about what has happened to the folks that you've reported on or have worked with and how they have faced reprisals from both the government and also the paramilitaries? Well, as you said, and as several reports from several organizations, but one of the most popular is Global Witness, it says that Colombia is a lethal country for activists in the world. Also, not for the environmental defenders, but also for social defenders. In fact, they launched a kind of quite new agreement in the world that it says, Acuerdo de Escazú, that it's a regional agreement that seeks to take care, no, to protect these environmental defenders. And it started some years ago in Costa Rica with discussions to how to do it. And finally, last year, it came after some countries that signed this agreement and also ratified. So right now, this some months ago, there was the first COP of this Acuerdo de Escazú, but Colombia only signed this agreement. It was during COP25 in Madrid, but never ratified. So this is quite curious also, because there is this quite polemic also with this agreement because some groups that are more linked with companies are afraid that maybe this agreement can affect their activities. But one of the things that also Gustavo Petro said that he will ratify. So it's not like the final solution, of course, but it's a step forward. It's indeed a step forward into a better system. You have, Judith, you have interviewed folks from the Colombian opposition on this side of the pond in Germany. You've talked to folks from Colombia who are working to put pressure on the government here in Germany, correct? So I was talking with some of the people that is involved in La Guajira and Cerrejón activities that they came to Germany to explain their situation there, because yes, finally, it's something that German people, they know. They came to give this information and to discuss with also with German activists. And they also went to this coal mining that we have here in Germany, that it's not so far, and that is also putting problems and pushing people that are living there to look for another place. And these activists, then they visited the Hambach and Garzweiler mines, and they saw firsthand then some of the communities and towns there that are being threatened with destruction, correct? Exactly. So they saw that we are far, but we are close, no? Because finally we are sharing the same problems, okay, with different situations or different backgrounds. But the thing is this, no? And they were quite surprised because they didn't know that here in Germany, we have also this big mine and all these problems that is producing with the communities that are living around and the forest that is there, no? Judith, I know you got to go, but one more question. As Pedro's government enters power, what can listeners expect and how do you anticipate he'll try to tackle, or what do you think he'll try to tackle during his first 100 to 150 days? I think there is a big expectation with Gustavo Pedro's government. And I think it's a little bit that will happen, that is happening in Chile, no? That finally with Gabriel Boric, that also won the elections and he was close to, for example, to Mapuche, that is the indigenous people that are living there in Chile. And there was a conflict there. But right now it seems that it's not dealing as the people they expected. So I think that there is a lot of expectation because there is a lot of things that the people that vote for him want to change. But maybe four years, it's not enough time. But yes, so as I told you, focusing more in social issues and the fact that, for example, he's right now choosing the people, no? That will do this government with him. So he's really taking people that is expert in their areas. So at least it seems that it's a good start. But we have to really take care about what he promised and what he's doing. And this is something that I think that civil society will be pushing to get these promises and that these promises became facts. Thank you for taking so much time out of your schedule with us today and explaining these things. Truly appreciated. Where can listeners do to find you? And for that matter, what are you working on now? OK, so you can find me on Twitter or Facebook or in Dochevele website. You can see all my articles there. Right now I'm working in a project that is linked with environmental organizations in Spain. But I have other things. It's also with Chile and other Latin American countries that you can follow in Dochevele website. Wonderful. Gracias, Judith. We'll put a few of those links then into the show notes. And again, thanks so much for coming on to the show and in this case, letting us make you late for your other activities. Thanks a lot for inviting me. I hope that it was interesting for you. Absolutely, Judith. And a big thanks to all of you who have tuned in and stayed tuned in.

A mega-merger creates America's first coast-to-coast rail operator. Plus, why utilities and technology companies are at odds over who should pay for the electricity costs in the unprecedented data center build-out. Utilities have, for a long time, been increasing rates to make the investments needed to stabilize the grid at this time. And in some places, the sheer amount of demand coming from data centers specifically adds another layer of stress. And how one of the biggest credit card deals ever could bring JPMorgan Chase and Apple together. It's Tuesday, July 29th. I'm Alex Zosola for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Union Pacific has agreed to acquire Norfolk Southern in a $71.5 billion deal, which would create the first company to control coast-to-coast rail shipments, joining 50,000 miles of railroad tracks that span from the Jersey Shore to the ports in California. The union would create a single company controlling coast-to-coast rail shipments for the first time in U.S. history. The deal still requires regulatory approval from the Surface Transportation Board. Esther Fung covers transportation companies for the journal and joins me now. Esther, why did we not have a coast-to-coast railway operator before? The reason why we don't have one single coast-to-coast rail operator before is largely due to regulators. In the past, when there were mergers between major railroads, there were lots of traffic snarls and service disruptions that occurred because some of these railroad executives admitted that they were overconfident in their ability to combine networks that had hundreds of thousands of freight rail cars. And the resulting service meltdown spooked shippers and made regulators very wary of approving such mergers again. So when big railways in the past have merged, what kinds of issues have resulted? When these major railways had merged, some of the big problems that have occurred was they laid off too many people at once and in key positions, but then they realized there were some issues and the right person to resolve these is no longer there. And then the bottlenecks happen. That is something the regulators do not want to see again. And Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern took pains this morning during the announcement and investor call to say that the networks are running well. They took pains to say that they will have a buffer of staff, locomotives and other resources to manage this transition. The truth is we don't know until it happens. Are we likely to see more consolidation within the transportation industry? Analysts expect further consolidation because this single line railroad would have competitive advantages that the other two, BNSF and CSX, would struggle with. So it's about maintaining their competitive edge. That was WSJ reporter Esther Fung. Thanks so much, Esther. Thank you. It's been a pleasure. The International Monetary Fund said today that the road ahead for the global economy has turned brighter this summer. The risks from the trade war remain. The U.S. and China saw some of the most significant upward forecast revisions, largely in recognition of a tariff truce the two countries reached in June. The IMF projected that the U.S. will also get a boost from the budget deal President Donald Trump signed earlier this month, with the biggest benefit flowing from better incentives for corporate investment. The Commerce Department's report on second-quarter U.S. growth is due tomorrow. Meanwhile, American consumers' economic mood improved this month, but remained clouded by concerns about tariffs and the labor market. That's according to the Conference Board, a research group that runs a monthly survey. The group said today that its Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 97.2 from 95.2 in June. About 30 percent of consumers said jobs are plentiful, up from June. But the number who said jobs are hard to get grew more, rising to 19 percent from 17 percent a month earlier. Major U.S. indexes were down today. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, ending its streak of record highs. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4 percent from yesterday's record, while the Dow dropped half a percent, or 205 points. We're exclusively reporting that JPMorgan Chase is in advanced talks to take over Apple's credit card program. That's according to people familiar with the matter. Discussions between the country's biggest bank and Apple accelerated in recent months, with Apple telling JPMorgan it is the tech giant's preferred choice to replace Goldman Sachs as its card partner. Still, the deal hasn't been signed, and there are chances that talks could unravel because of a number of challenges associated with the Apple program. For more, I'm joined by WSJ banking reporter Anna Maria Andriotis. Anna Maria, what would be the significance of this deal? We're talking about one of the most popular credit cards that's attached to one of the largest tech companies in the world, and that could potentially go to the biggest bank in the U.S. So we're talking about a program that's very popular, and the companies tied to it, or vying to be tied to it, are among the largest and, quite frankly, the most powerful from the tech and financial side. What would this mean for Goldman? If this program actually finally does move, this would be the final step in Goldman's exit from consumer lending. Goldman several years ago entered into consumer lending with a plan to become big on Main Street. The credit card launch with Apple basically cemented those ambitions of Goldman. That's pretty much all done right now. Goldman has offloaded pretty much everything having to do with lending to consumers, with the exception of Apple and this credit card program. So as we reported, the deal has not yet been signed, and there are chances that it could unravel. But as of now, the two sides have advanced significantly. That was WSJ reporter Anna-Maria Andriotis. Thanks Anna-Maria. Thank you. Shares in Novo Nordisk plunged as much as 30 percent today, at one point wiping out almost $93 billion of the company's market capitalization after the Danish drugmaker said headwinds for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wigovi would cut its sales growth for the year. Novo has lost its lead in the booming market for weight loss drugs, opening the door to competitors such as makers of knockoff versions of Novo's drugs and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. It's the latest in a series of challenges facing the once high-flying company, which also today named a new CEO. Coming up, as artificial intelligence demands a lot more electricity, a debate is raging about who will pay for it. That's after the break. With a major selection of the looks your kiddos love, starting at just $4 in the Walmart app, a new school year means a stylish new them. Who knew? Find skater skirts and Crocs that say, I'm casual but cool. Sparkly sneakers that say, it's my classroom, you're just learning in it. And preppy polos that say, I'm the teacher's pet, even if they're mommy's menace at home. Find their favorite styles starting at just $4 in the app. The Walmart you thought you knew is now new. Technology companies need an extraordinary amount of electricity to power data centers at the core of the artificial intelligence race. Now across the U.S., utilities are asking tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to pay more to connect their new data centers to the power grid. I'm joined now by Katherine Blunt, who covers power and utilities for WSJ. Katherine, why exactly are tech companies being asked to pay more? A number of places around the country, utilities are becoming concerned that the enormous cost of the new infrastructure that they need to build to serve a really significant buildout of data centers could ultimately be borne by regular customers if tech companies don't ultimately need all the electricity that they say that they will. So for example, if a utility spends a billion dollars to build a power line, largely to serve a data center, and the data center packs up and leaves in five years, it's possible that the remaining customers on the system would have to pay for that particular infrastructure. So utilities are asking tech companies to pay more to take on the financial risks that other customers won't have to. So what are tech companies saying about this? To be clear, tech companies aren't saying we don't want to pay our fair share. They say that they do. They say that they're committed to doing that. But in some cases, they say, look, we don't want to have to pay substantially more for this particular upgrade because it also serves other customers, not just us. The grid is a network, right? So if you add more transmission or you add another power plant, it does benefit customers other than the data center. And so basically, they're saying we understand the risks of so-called stranded assets, but we also don't want to take on more risk than necessary. And I'm curious what local communities are saying about this. Like a lot of communities where you see a sudden influx in demand from data centers, concern among regular folks that they ultimately end up subsidizing the build out of this infrastructure, right? Because power costs have been going up substantially in a lot of places for a while now. And the idea of having to pay more for something that they didn't necessarily ask for is not necessarily a palatable idea. That was Wall Street Journal reporter Katherine Blunt. Thanks, Katherine. Thank you. For many years, workers and bosses had an understanding. Entry-level employees work hard for lower pay, while employers provide training and experience to give young professionals a foothold in the job market. WSJ reporter Lindsay Ellis, who covers workplace and careers, told our tech news briefing podcast that now artificial intelligence threatens to completely break that contract, which was already weakened. Some of the sectors that we've been pointed to are information, tech jobs, finance, insurance, technical services. For example, Grindr CEO said that they would rather hire more seasoned engineers instead of junior coders straight out of school. One recruiting firm told me that typically they would have high-volume demand from marketing agencies to hire entry-level staff. That work has totally vanished. One company I talked to, the CEO basically said, typically we bring on a summer intern. For years and years, we've done that, especially for social media. This year, instead of coaching a summer intern, I'm just going to talk into ChatGPT and it's going to clean up the copy and those posts will be ready for airtime. To hear more, listen to today's episode of Tech News Briefing. And finally, the gunman who killed four people in a midtown Manhattan skyscraper yesterday accused the National Football League in a suicide note of concealing the dangers of the sport on players' brains. That's according to a New York Police Department official. Police said that 27-year-old Shane Tamura used an M4 rifle to kill an NYPD police officer in the lobby of the building, as well as a security guard, an executive of financial firm Blackstone, and a real estate firm employee before shooting himself in the chest. Police say Tamura, who lived in Las Vegas and had a history of mental illness, played football in high school. A spokesperson for the NFL referred a request for comment to the NYPD.

### Famine Unfolding in Gaza, Experts Say

**Full Transcript:**
With a major selection of the looks your kiddos love starting at just $4 in the Walmart app, a new school year means a stylish new them. Who knew? Find skater skirts and Crocs that say, I'm casual but cool. Sparkly sneakers that say, it's my classroom, you're just learning in it. And preppy polos that say, I'm the teacher's pet, even if they're mommy's menace at home. Find their favorite styles starting at just $4 in the app. The Walmart you thought you knew is now new. Food insecurity experts say Gaza is now in a state of famine. Plus a shooting in the heart of New York City leaves a Blackstone executive and several others dead. And how the Trump administration plans to raise $1 trillion in just three months. Treasury Secretary Scott Besson has been very open in talking about this. He calls himself the country's top bond salesman. It's Tuesday, July the 29th. I'm Azhar Soukri for The Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Famine is now unfolding in Gaza. That's the most dire assessment of the enclave's deepening hunger crisis since the start of the war. An interim report released this morning by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, found at least 16 children under five have died of hunger-related causes since mid-July. Journal correspondent Margarita Stancati says it's the first time the UN-supported group has described the food crisis in such terms. Food security experts are saying that all areas of the Gaza Strip are experiencing rapidly deteriorating food insecurity. So when it comes to extreme food shortage, you know, most households are saying that they regularly are not having food to eat of any kind and that often people go to bed hungry. Acute childhood malnutrition is getting much worse across the enclave and particularly in the north, and hunger-related deaths are increasing. So these are the three criteria used to measure famine conditions. And the IPC, in its update, said all three things are getting worse. The situation has become so severe that even President Trump weighed in on it yesterday. He referred to images he's seen on TV and he said, you know, some of those kids, that's real starvation stuff. And his comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, you know, there is no policy of starvation in Gaza and, in fact, there is no starvation in Gaza. Today's assessment is not an official declaration of famine, which happens rarely and is very politically sensitive. It's now up to governments and senior UN officials to declare a famine based on the IPC's assessment. A lone shooter has killed four people, including a police officer and an executive from financial firm Blackstone in a midtown New York building. The gunman then turned the gun on himself. Speaking last night, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tish said the shooter was 27-year-old Shane Temura, who had driven his black BMW across the country from Colorado, double-parked on Park Avenue during the evening rush, and began shooting as soon as he was inside the building lobby. 35 Park Avenue is a commercial office building whose tenants include the NFL, Rudin Management, KPMG and Blackstone. Four innocent victims are dead. Among them is NYPD police officer Deedarul Islam, 36 years old, four years on the job. The NYPD said the alleged shooter had a documented mental health history and that his motives are still under investigation. A fifth person remains in critical condition. We are exclusively reporting that the Trump administration is considering a plan to raise tens of billions of dollars with a new fee that would transform the patent system. That's according to people familiar with the matter. It would be a radical move that would likely get pushback from businesses. The People's said that Commerce Department officials are discussing charging holders 1% to 5% of their patent value, a shift that could dramatically increase fees. A Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment. And in another exclusive, we're reporting that premiums for Medicare drug plans are set to increase sharply next year. That's mostly due to rising costs, regulatory changes and cutbacks to a subsidy programme. That initiative has largely shielded seniors from rising monthly bills in 2025. According to a Medicare official, the subsidy programme pumped an extra $6.2 billion of federal payments into so-called Part D plans this year. The Trump administration is set to cut spending on that programme by about 40% in 2026. Mars, the maker of M&Ms, Skittles and Kind bars, will invest more than $2 billion into US factories over the next 18 months, spanning its snacking, food and pet care businesses. Mars has already invested about $6 billion over the past five years, which it said added 9,000 jobs in the US. The company, one of the world's biggest family-owned and privately-held firms, said that 94% of its products sold in the US are now made in America. And kicking off a busy day for earnings, Spotify said that it added about 12% more premium subscribers in the second quarter, topping its own guidance. The streaming platform expanded access to its audiobooks and personalised music offerings around the world. But the company still swung to a loss of about $100 million amid higher personnel and marketing costs. This morning we'll also get results from UnitedHealth, Merck, Procter & Gamble and Boeing, with Visa and Starbucks reporting after the closing bell. Coming up, Wall Street is bracing for a deluge of Treasury bills as the Trump administration moves to shake things up in the dusty government bond market. But more on that story after the break.

The Trump administration is making government borrowing exciting again, or as some investors might see it, more unpredictable than it has been in decades. Enormous tax and spending plans mean the administration is having to issue a load of short-term bonds to finance its deficit. Sam Goldfarb has written extensively about the U.S. debt market. Sam, we learned yesterday that the Treasury expects to borrow more than a trillion dollars this coming quarter. That's a huge leap from previous estimates. How did we get here? Yeah, so basically the U.S. government has a fairly large gap between the revenue that's taking in in taxes and the money that it's spending on everything from Medicare to defense. And this predated this latest Trump administration, but he's extended tax cuts that he passed in his first administration, and that's sort of like locked in this fiscal trajectory, which just means that the government has to borrow a lot of money to make sure that it can meet its spending obligations. Yeah, so clearly a lot of debt is about to come to the market to finance that big, beautiful bill. Is the Trump administration doing anything to shore up support among investors? Yeah, so it's kind of interesting. In the past, presidents and Treasury secretaries have really not waded too much into this issue about exactly how they're going to borrow. But Treasury Secretary Scott Besant has been very open in talking about this. He calls himself the country's top bond salesman. And Trump himself has said, we're going to go very short term, wait for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to have his term expire, and then we're going to get rates way down, and then we're going to go long term. And that kind of talk is just unusual because in the past, administrations felt like that we should just basically not talk about this, sort of have investors not think about it, and then just come up with a mix of debt that could kind of last for the long term. Right. And the administration is due to provide a formal update about its borrowing plans tomorrow. That's usually a fairly run-of-the-mill announcement. But investors seem to be watching more closely as to which bonds are being issued. Am I right? So basically, the base case is that nothing will change, that they'll just keep issuing notes and bonds that mature two years to 30 years at the same pace as they've been doing. Now that suggests, in some ways it sounds like, okay, so nothing's changing. But if they just continue to do that, as the borrowing needs grow, that means that they'll have to do the additional borrowing with short-term debt, with bills that mature in a year or less. So just maintaining the status quo, in some ways, over time, will amount to a policy change. Because if you just are issuing the same amount of, let's say, 10-year notes, but the borrowing needs are getting bigger, you have to issue more short-term debt. And with the Fed's latest rate decision due tomorrow, there will be a lot to sift through, not least any indications of when a rate cut could be expected that might send the interest and all that debt down.

### What to Make of the U.S.-EU Deal That Averted Trade War
**Publication Date:** 2025-07-28 21:02:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2570

**Full Transcript:**
This episode is brought to you by Charles Schwab. Decisions made in Washington can affect your portfolio every day. Washington Wise from Charles Schwab is an original podcast that unpacks the stories making news there. Listen at Schwab.com slash Washington Wise. The US-EU trade deal averts a potential trade war as President Trump seems set on tariffs. It goes to show that Trump has zero intention on removing these tariffs entirely, that they're going to be part of his negotiating strategy. And it's a real clear signal for other countries coming to the table, they're not going to do away with these tariffs one way or another. The deal marks a victory for Trump but faces pushback in Europe. And why companies are touting workforce reductions to Wall Street. It's Monday, July 28th. I'm Sabrina Siddiqi for The Wall Street Journal, covering for Alex Ossola. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic breathe a sigh of relief that the US and European Union have averted a bruising trade war with their agreement on tariffs and investment. Now attention is shifting to assessing the deal's winners and losers. The deal would impose a 15% baseline tariff on most European goods, while the EU has also agreed to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of US energy products and invest in the US. Brian Schwartz, The Wall Street Journal's White House economic policy reporter joins me to discuss. Brian, this is the most consequential agreement Trump has announced thus far. How did we arrive at this deal? Well, this was weeks in the making. There was a letter that was sent out by President Trump recently, basically saying that the EU was set to pay a 30% tariff. But then things quickly changed when the president decided to meet with the leaders of the EU in Scotland. That ratcheted things up very, very quickly, and it led to the deal that was announced. And his presence, according to everybody we talked to, really did make the difference to push this thing over the finish line over the last few days. What does this agreement mean for the US? Well, frankly, the deal seems to give more of a benefit to the United States than it does to the European Union. We're talking about the European Union guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars in investments into the United States. That's a big deal. I don't remember a trade deal featuring the European Union that had those types of details. And on the other hand, the 15% tariff, although less than the 30% that the president originally said he would put on the European Union, is significant because it goes to show that Trump has zero intention on removing these tariffs entirely, that they're going to be part of his negotiating strategy. It's a real clear signal for other countries coming to the table, they're not going to do away with these tariffs one way or another. And what has the reaction been like here at home? The stock market overall has been pretty happy about this. The White House has, of course, been pushing out how big of a deal this is. Listen, this was one of his wills for the president and his team. And in the end, they managed to get this done. How has the deal been received in Europe? When I read things from expert analysts on this stuff, a lot of people think it really isn't a great deal for the European Union, that they gave a lot of way in order to avoid the president's wrath. A lot of analysts think that the EU gave away kind of the barn here a little bit. That's the thinking out of fear that the president was going to unleash the tariff juggernaut on them. So the deal has been agreed to in principle. What are the next steps? Just like any other trade deal, it's not going to be something that happens automatically. You know, these are hundreds of billions of dollars of investments over the time span of a couple of years. So you're not going to see something jump out in the next week where you're going to see this company come out and immediately be able to build a plant somewhere in the United States. But if it pans out the way the president wants it to pan out, that is going to be pretty significant for potential job growth here in the United States. Brian Schwartz is a White House economic policy reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Brian, thank you. Thank you. Following President Trump's trade deal with the European Union, the euro sank against the dollar. In U.S. markets, the Nasdaq edged 0.3 percent higher, while the Dow Industrial slipped 0.1 percent and the S&P 500 wavered. A majority of Americans support President Trump's goal of cracking down on illegal immigration, but they say his approach has gone too far. That's according to a new Wall Street Journal poll, which found that just over half of voters approve of Trump's handling of illegal immigration, a centerpiece of his agenda. 62 percent of respondents favored deporting people who came to the country illegally. But 58 percent of voters opposed two steps under Trump's mass deportation push. The first is detaining and deporting people believed to be in the U.S. illegally without them seeing a judge or getting a hearing. The second is deporting immigrants to prisons in other countries, such as El Salvador and South Sudan, where they have no personal connections. Speaking in Scotland today, President Trump said he would shorten the deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine or face more economic pressure from the U.S. I'm going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today. No reason to wait. There's no reason to wait. It's 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don't see any progress being made. Earlier this month, Trump had given Putin 50 days to agree to a peace deal or threaten that the U.S. would unleash a tariff package on Russia's trading partners. Today, Trump voiced frustration with Russian attacks on Ukraine intensifying despite what he thought were positive talks with Putin. It was not exactly clear what actions Russia would face if it didn't end the fighting by mid-August. The president also said the U.S. and Europe would launch a program to deliver food directly to Palestinians in Gaza as a deadly hunger crisis grips the territory. Speaking in Scotland with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump described the food crisis in Gaza as a terrible situation. The initiative's details are unclear, with questions arising over whether it is a new effort or an expansion of an existing Israeli-backed program. A White House spokeswoman said further details of the plan would be forthcoming. Trump's announcement comes amid growing pressure over Gaza's food crisis, which has rapidly deteriorated in recent weeks. The United Nations says thousands of children are being treated for malnutrition. Its medical partners have reported that more than a dozen children have starved to death this month alone.

Big companies are getting smaller and their CEOs want everyone to know it. Gone are the days when trimming headcount was a sign of trouble. Companies are openly touting workforce reductions to Wall Street, marking a shift from more careful language in the past. Smaller workforces, influenced by startups and the use of AI, are now viewed by many executives as an asset. For more, I'm joined by Wall Street Journal reporter Chip Cutter. Chip, what is behind the shift in how corporations are talking about staff reductions? Part of it is a cooling labor market and this desire among many large companies to really embrace AI and to wring costs out in the process. So we've gone from a point where CEOs used to talk about employees as the talent, as their greatest assets, to now many CEOs thinking that these employees are almost an impediment, that large teams might be holding them back from progress. And so we've seen a really dramatic swing now in the ways that companies are talking about this. They're almost bragging about the ways that they're able to cut headcount. Just to give you a little flavor for what we're seeing out there. The CEO of Wells Fargo recently said that the bank had been able to cut headcount for 20 consecutive quarters. He said that the bank was using attrition, quote, as our friend. The CEO of Verizon, meanwhile, boasted to investors that the company had been, quote, very, very good on headcount. He noted that it's going down all the time. We're expecting the latest monthly jobs report on Friday. What does this smaller workforce trend tell us about the labor market? I think it just shows that we are at this moment where companies are thinking really critically about whether to add white collar jobs or not. This is all affecting the corporate positions, the higher paid, knowledge-based jobs that are out there. And so what companies are doing is they're starting to blur roles, they're keeping jobs unfilled, they're holding back on hiring. So it's not that we're typically seeing large scale layoffs yet, but it's companies sort of really evaluating whether they need to add jobs to grow going forward. We've heard, for example, companies talk about a product manager being blended with that of a software engineer. There's been other examples of that, of companies saying, we're going to use more technology to then ensure that we no longer need to add headcount in this area. Perhaps it gets redeployed elsewhere, or perhaps we just don't fill those positions. Chip Cutter is a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Thank you, Chip. Thank you. The latest food trend to take over TikTok feeds and convenience store treat aisles? Dubai chocolate, a confection that typically involves a shell of rich chocolate filled with pistachio cream and a shredded dough known as kataifi. Some of the biggest food companies in America are picking up on it while considering whether the Dubai chocolate flavor might endure as a future classic, like a pumpkin spice or salted caramel. My colleague Alex Osela spoke with WSJ reporter Owen Tucker-Smith and asked him about the challenges these companies are facing as they are looking to incorporate Dubai chocolate into their products. So the list of ingredients in Dubai chocolate happened to be difficult to procure. Chocolate has already been a problem because cocoa prices are remaining so, so high. And so chocolate has actually been a product that plenty of food companies have been backing away from recently. Pistachios are also a traditionally expensive nut. And some companies have even been skeptical about including more pistachio desserts because it hasn't always traditionally sold well. And then the kataifi is a lesser known product in the U.S. and you will all of a sudden have all these companies from across the world trying to get a hold of it at the same time. And when those things happen, there's a supply chain bottleneck. Prices go up, supply goes down. And it means that you have to really deploy a lot of resources in your company to make it happen at an affordable level, at a high quality level, and in the short timeframe required to get it out while this is still a hot trend. Given these challenges, is this likely to become a long-term staple in terms of flavor profile? That is the question for all these food companies these days, is there's a new TikTok trend every week that's hyping up a new flavor profile, a new food, and oftentimes you don't want to chase those because by the time you get the resources together, it's already over. And one of the examples we say in the story is whipped coffee, which for a moment during COVID felt like it was all the rage. But if you had pivoted your business model to chase something like that, now it wouldn't be good for you. But at the same time, another trend is that we're seeing a faster emergence of long-term flavor profiles, meaning that there are trends that might look like a fad at the moment, but are actually very quickly becoming competitors to some of the staples like salted caramel. And so that's the bet that these companies are making, but you'll never know if it's going to be a long-term thing until it stands the test of time. That was WSJ reporter Owen Tucker-Smith speaking with Alex Osela. And that's what's news for this Monday afternoon, additional audio in today's episode courtesy of Reuters.

### U.S., EU Strike Biggest Trade Deal So Far

It delivers stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Plus, Samsung and Tesla agree to a multi-billion dollar chip supply deal. And Israel pauses military activity in Gaza to allow in humanitarian aid. It's Monday, July the 28th. I'm Azhar Soukry for the Wall Street Journal. Here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Uncertainty in uncertain times. That's how European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement the world's two biggest trade partners reached yesterday. It is the largest deal President Trump has announced so far as he tries to remake the global trading system. We are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15 percent. In return, the EU has agreed to buy US energy products and invest $600 billion in the US. Our Brussels reporter Kim McRael has been following the talks. Kim, explain to us what has been agreed and just how consequential this deal is. So I think the basic framework for this idea, and I have to mention, we don't have anything in writing at this point. So really all of what we understand about what was agreed to is based on what the two leaders, President Trump and the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen, said last night. So they both say that we're looking at a 15 percent tariff on most European goods that are exported to the US. Crucially for the EU, that includes autos, that includes the automotive sector, which is something that the Europeans were very concerned about, especially because of the German car industry, which is currently facing the 25 percent tariff that Trump issued for the world. And what's really important about this is that the EU is the biggest regional trading partner of the United States. So the bloc has 27 member states. They all have a common trade policy. And when you take them together, they are the US's biggest trading partner and the biggest source of foreign investment to the US. So when you think about it on a daily basis, the two sides exchange more than $5 billion worth of goods and services each day. So what are the US and the EU getting out of this? From the EU side, they have sort of agreed to cementing quite high tariffs, much higher than ever before. So previously, tariffs for European goods exported to the US were less than 5 percent on average. We're looking at a jump to 15 percent for most goods. So it's a huge shift and something that is expected to have a negative impact on the European economy. On the other hand, moving to a point where businesses have a sense of what level they should expect gives the kind of stability that a lot of European business leaders and business groups have been saying they really could use to try to plan for the future. On the American side, it reinforces Trump's interest in having baseline tariffs that are quite high compared to previous years. He hopes that that could allow for some reshoring of industry in the US. The other thing that the US can get from this is the pledges that the EU made in terms of additional investments in the US, as well as pledges to purchase more from the US, especially on energy, liquefied natural gas, I think is something that we'll probably see when the details of the agreement come out. We'll probably see a big focus on that. How does this trade deal then compare with some of the other deals that Trump has been reaching, especially ahead of the August deadline as he tries to remake the global trading system? Yeah, so what we see with the general outline of this deal is that it looks quite similar to the agreement that was announced with Japan last week. So both of them got the 15 baseline tariff, both had it applied to the automotive industry as well. And I think what that tells us is that we're starting to see 15% shake out as the likely level of minimum tariffs on most major US trading partners. So it is true that the UK, which did a deal earlier on, did get a 10% level. At this point, it looks like most others are likely to see 15% or higher. It puts some pressure on other countries that don't have a deal yet. And I'm thinking, for example, of South Korea, to try to get something similar, because the situation you may have now is those that have a 15% tariff, or in the UK's case, a 10% tariff, they may end up having a competitive advantage over other trading partners that, for example, are facing those 25% tariffs on cars that Trump put into place. Wall Street Journal, Brussels reporter Kim McRyle, thank you so much for your insights. Thanks so much for having me. And Trump will continue his trade efforts when he sits down with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer today to iron out final details of the UK agreement. US and Chinese officials are also set to meet in Stockholm today and tomorrow to discuss extending their trade truce beyond the current August 12th expiration. Turning to Gaza now, where Israel has announced a tactical pause in military activity to allow for safe routes for humanitarian aid as deadly malnutrition spreads across the enclave. The announcement follows growing pressure from Arab and Western officials over what residents and humanitarian workers say is the worst hunger crisis in Gaza since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. The World Food Programme, or WFP, said yesterday that it welcomes Israel's commitment to humanitarian pauses and corridors and hoped new measures would improve conditions on the ground. However, the WFP's country director for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Antoine Renard, says this shouldn't be a one-off. This is long overdue and we need still to reiterate how important is the ceasefire. So now we see this as a proper way for us to increase the assistance into Gaza, but it will not be within, you know, one single day that we can actually change the current level of salvation that you have currently in Gaza. In a sign of how desperate the situation has become, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan resumed airdrops of aid overnight and this morning, parachuting loads including flour, sugar and canned food into the enclave. Coming up, a major win for Samsung as it signs a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture semiconductors for Tesla. And in the face of rising temperatures, Europe is taking notes from the US on air conditioning. That and more after the break. Samsung Electronics will make chips for Tesla in a $16.5 billion multi-year deal, marking a major win for its foundry business. In a post on X, Tesla boss Elon Musk said Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to making the EV maker's next-generation AI6 chip. The Journal's Korea Bureau Chief Tim Martin says the deal is crucial for Samsung and comes at a particularly sensitive time for the US and South Korea, who are yet to hash out a trade agreement. This is one of the largest chip deals we've ever seen. This represents 7% of its overall revenue and that includes Samsung's divisions with smartphones and televisions and appliances. This is just a massive amount of money, but it comes at a very vulnerable moment. These chips will be made at its new facilities in Texas. And appeasing America, helping the US revive its semiconductor industry is a core concern for Samsung and many global companies. There is a big push that started under President Biden and now certainly is the case under President Trump that foreign companies need to do more of their business and core technologies in the US and perhaps no industry is more vital than semiconductors. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison says it's in talks with a BlackRock-led consortium to include a strategic investor from China as part of its plans to sell ports on either end of the Panama Canal. CK Hutchison didn't identify the Chinese company. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that China was pushing for state-owned Costco to be an equal partner and shareholder of the ports. This, as earlier moves to put the ports into US ownership reportedly angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping. President Trump has identified the ports as a security concern due to their Chinese connections. And Citigroup is launching a new premium credit card aimed at frequent travellers. It's the latest salvo in a high-stakes war among banks to win over affluent customers. With a $595 annual fee, the Strata Elite card is Citi's answer to JP Morgan Chase's Sapphire Reserve and American Express' Platinum cards, which offer a bevy of rewards but charge higher fees. And seeing as we started the show with a major transatlantic deal, we thought we'd end on another important change of heart, bringing Europe closer to the US. Because it seems that searing summer heatwaves may be softening Europeans' long-standing resistance to air conditioning. And that's kicked off a new political fight about the wisdom of installing the technology everywhere, as climate change reporter Matthew Dalton reports. This year what happened was that the heatwave came particularly early. At the end of June, beginning of July, before people had a chance to get out of the cities and go on their extended European vacations, people were really feeling the heat. So that prompted a lot of criticism, generally from the right, from politicians in France and the UK and Spain, where the heatwave was particularly ferocious. There are two sides to this. There's one side where if it gets too hot, people can die. The flip side of that is that a lot of Europeans don't like air conditioning that much. They don't like the feeling of being in an air-conditioned room for extended periods of time. And then I think a lot of Europeans are concerned about the energy usage from air conditioning. And there are also some industries that depend on cooling to keep their products good. You know, I mentioned in my story a vineyard that air-conditions its wine vats to keep them from turning to vinegar. So there are some cases where air conditioning really is a necessity. And that's it for What's News for this Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bach and Kate Boulivant. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhoff.

This episode is brought to you by Charles Schwab. Decisions made in Washington can affect your portfolio every day. Washington Wise from Charles Schwab is an original podcast that unpacks the stories making news there. Listen at schwab.com slash washingtonwise. Hey What's News listeners. It's Sunday, July 27th. I'm Alex Osala for The Wall Street Journal. This is What's New Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news by reaching out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. On today's show, startups are aiming for an audacious reboot of America's nuclear energy program. The sector is receiving unprecedented private support and enthusiasm from the Trump administration. Could the U.S. be seeing the dawn of a new nuclear age? We'll get into what this would look like and what it would take to get there. U.S. electricity consumption reached an all-time high last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And as A.I. continues to take off, that demand is only expected to grow. Recent executive orders from President Trump aim to quadruple nuclear power generation in the next 25 years. It's a challenging prospect. For many Americans, memories of meltdowns like Three Mile Island in 1979 and Fukushima in 2011 still linger. Due to factors like competition from cheaper energy sources, the number of new nuclear plants in the U.S. has declined since the 1990s. And traditional nuclear plants can cost tens of billions of dollars to build. Enter small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs. Though designs vary, these small reactors can be built in factories at lower costs than a whole new plant, and shipped to where they're needed. But questions remain, like what it will take to make them cost-effective, and whether they will be enough to meet America's energy needs. To talk about this, I'm joined by Clay Sell, CEO of Xenergy, an SMR reactor and fuel developer, and WSJ Renewable Energy reporter Jennifer Hiller. Jennifer, let's get a sense of where we're at now. How is nuclear power different today than, say, the 70s? In some ways, it's kind of like the 70s still. We have a lot of large reactors, and that's what was being built in the 70s and 80s. But there is just a lot more talk right now than what seems to be action beginning, where we're looking at what could be maybe a next era of construction, where we might see a variety of kinds of reactors built. And Clay, how are reactors different now on a technical level? The technology is not the same. Fission is the same. The fissioning process is the same. But the reactors that are emerging today, including the technology we're developing at my company, Xenergy, is very different. These are reactors that are intrinsically safe. In the case of our reactor, it cannot melt down. So when you think about what happened at Three Mile Island or what happened at Chernobyl, we have developed a technology where it's physically impossible for that to happen. So these are very different machines that we're bringing to the marketplace and that we'll be bringing online in the early 2030s. Jennifer, what do we know about the safety record of these designs? Some of the designs are meltdown proof, and the regulators are the ones that will approve those designs. And some of the SMRs are going the path of doing sort of a smaller version of our existing reactors. So those would maybe have the potential, but we haven't had a lot of accidents in the U.S., and so there's a fairly good safety record. It seems like nuclear is having a bit of a moment right now. What has changed to enable this? A few things have changed. If you look at maybe 10 or 15 years ago, people were talking about building a lot of reactors, and that didn't end up happening, basically for market reasons. Today there's a lot of new designs, there's a lot of tax policy support, there's a lot of government support for trying to start some new projects. So that's new, and you really need some level of government support to get things off the ground essentially in this industry. And on top of that, I think one of the things that looks fundamentally different this year versus even just two years ago is that you have a customer, and that you have a customer in the tech industry potentially that is willing to help bear some of the capital risk of trying a new project. There's a lot of state interest in doing these projects, but you have an off-taker customer that is willing, in some cases, to put some money on the table. Clay, I'm curious, which of the factors that Jennifer just talked about are making the biggest difference for your company? It is really the tremendous increase in demand for electricity that is largely and most popularly being driven by the hyperscalers and the big data center operators that have to operate 24-7. And most of the new growth in generation in the United States over the last 20 years has been in wind and solar, but they are not 24-7. And it just so happens that in the last five or 10 years, nuclear power has scourged in popularity. Last March, Gallup released a poll showing that 61% of Americans favor the use of expanded nuclear energy. And so nuclear is popular. The need for 24-7 clean power is clearly evident. Political support from both Republicans and Democrats has materialized in a very aggressive set of policies to promote the industry. And all of those things have come together to create a very different environment for nuclear power in 2025. Coming up, what would it take to make this nuclear future a reality?

Public opinion on nuclear power in the U.S. has become rosier in the past few years, but there's still some wariness. Clay, what are you hearing about how communities are thinking about safety and the possibility of nuclear accidents? There's a generational change that is happening. People that are older than me, and I'm 58, they kind of have a very old and I would argue stale view of nuclear power from the last generation. They're children of the Cold War, they saw the China syndrome, they have views. But the younger generation, 50 and below, have a very different view. They have concerns about the health of the globe, they have concerns about climate change, they recognize that nuclear is a very safe form that makes no air emissions, and they also recognize that no technology is a 100% solution. Everything has pluses and minuses, but when you electrify things, you need more and more electricity. And if it's coming from a coal plant that is belching carbon emissions and soot into the air versus nuclear power, which by independent data is the safest form of generation that has ever been deployed at scale. Jennifer, I'm curious what you make of this. A big portion of the people who are supporters of nuclear energy just are looking at how much wind and solar and battery can you add, and that you need some sort of baseload resource to complement all of that. And people landed on nuclear as this large existing asset. It's a backbone to the grid, essentially, it provides this stable resource. And I think just the further away in time that you get from something like Three Mile Island in the US, opinions change a little bit. And I think these are probably not going to go into communities that don't want them. Generally, places that have nuclear plants like their nuclear plants, and would probably not be opposed to adding another reactor or adding some SMRs. That said, there's always going to be some level of opposition to any projects and people who are concerned about the potential for an accident or just what happens to the waste. I don't think that you're not going to have any opposition at all. There's going to be that for almost any kind of energy project, including this kind. Jennifer, is the grid actually able to handle the amount of power that we're talking about here? Yeah, there's a big debate about that going on. Because when you look at the demand projections, they're pretty startling. And they would imply that we need to build a lot more of the wires and poles kind of transmission infrastructure to move power around, and also a lot of new generation. And if the demand projections are anything in the neighborhood of what is being forecast, you're going to have to build out the grid more. And then you also have kind of an aging grid. And so a lot of equipment is also needing to be just replaced and repaired. Fundamentally, the grid will just have to handle it, but it can be a slow process in some places. And so you are already seeing instances where potential customers are being told in different parts of the country, we cannot connect you for electric service for five years, six years, seven years. There's an interesting opportunity with the grid as it relates to nuclear power. A lot of the transmission that's been built in the United States, as difficult as it is to do, has been built to move wind power from places that people generally don't live to the load centers where they do live. And the great thing about nuclear power is the geographic flexibility to side it relatively close to the load. So for example, the first project that we're building, we're building for Dow Chemical. It is literally behind the meter at their plant in Cedric, Texas. So tell me about Xenergy's plans beyond the one that you just mentioned to scale, to have reactors across the U.S. I understand that there aren't currently any, right? You're right. This new generation of reactors are in development. In some places we've begun construction, but none of them are operating today. And they won't come into operation until the early 2030s. Last year, Xenergy announced a major collaboration with Amazon, and we agreed to work together to deploy up to 5 gigawatts, 5,000 megawatts of power for them in the next 15 years. We are working on a plan to build up to 12 units at a site in Washington State. That project has already begun in collaboration with Utility Energy Northwest. Amazon is putting hundreds of millions of dollars of the project capital into that project to make it happen. And that news was a major game changer in our industry. President Trump's recent executive orders aim to quadruple nuclear power generation in the next 25 years. What will it take to hit those targets that he's laid out? So number one, we have to get started. The industry has to get moving immediately. Number two, we have to recognize that it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital. And so the programs in place that the government is providing, loan guarantees, tax support, these first-of-a-kind programs for the nuclear sector, those are very important to reduce the capital risk. And the third thing we have to do is we have to rebuild our supply chain enterprise to build nuclear power plants. We largely got out of the business of building nuclear power plants in the United States. So that's a generation of workers that have gone away. It's plants, it's suppliers of nuclear equipment that have shut down. All of that has to be built back. That was Xenergy CEO Clay Sell and WSJ reporter Jennifer Hiller. Thank you both so much. Alex, Jennifer, great being with you. Thank you. And that's what's new Sunday for July 27th. Today's show was produced by Charlotte Gartenberg with supervising producer Michael Kosmedes and deputy editor Chris Zinsley. I'm Alex Ozola, and we'll be back tomorrow morning with a brand new show. Until then, thanks for listening.

I'm Francesca Fontana for The Wall Street Journal, and this is What's News in Markets, our look at the biggest stock moves of the week and the news that drove them. Let's get to it. Earnings and meme stocks. That is what comes to my mind when I think about this past week, as investors digested a slate of quarterly reports from tech giants, airlines, restaurants, and more. And yes, you heard me right. The market has fully debuted meme stock season two. The first season, I'm sure you'll recall, being the frenzy that surrounded stocks such as GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond. So what stocks are getting memefied this time around? Well, I'm going to leave you in suspense for a few minutes. First, let's zoom out. How'd the indexes do? Well, this week started strong, with Verizon's earnings helping boost the S&P 500 to a new high on Monday, and the index just kept on rallying. On Friday, the S&P notched its 14th record close of 2025, and the Nasdaq notched its 15th. And on a weekly basis, the Dow rose 1.3%, the S&P rose 1.5%, and the Nasdaq rose 1%. All right, where was I? Meme stocks. You guys, the Redditors are so back. This time around, they have dialed in on stocks like retailer Kohl's, donut chain Krispy Kreme, and online house flipper Opendoor. Some of them may seem a little goofy, but they all have some common ground, right? Meme traders are seeking out the cheap, beaten down, heavily shorted stocks. And just like we saw last time, we saw some big jumps this week. Let's see. Kohl's on Tuesday more than doubled at the open and then closed 38% higher. And Opendoor's also been on a tear, and its shares jumped 43% that day. And the craze just continued into Wednesday. GoPro, you know, the company that makes those cool cameras and stuff, its shares jumped 57%. And Krispy Kreme rose 20%. Of course, with this kind of volatility, it's not surprising to see some pulling back and pushing forward the rest of the week. But on a weekly basis, Kohl's still gained 34% and Krispy Kreme gained 41%. Earnings season has been pretty strong so far. But two companies that disappointed are Tesla and Chipotle Mexican Grill. So we're talking electric cars and burrito bowls. Elon Musk's EVmaker posted earnings late Wednesday, and its sales sure could use a jump start. It posted a 12% drop in quarterly revenue and an even steeper fall in net income. And the next day, we saw Tesla shares fall 8.2%, and on the week, the stock fell 4.1%. Then there was Chipotle. Now, as we know, people are tightening their purse strings and we're seeing restaurant demand pulling back. But usually, Chipotle's customer base is steady since many of its fans tend to have more disposable income and will still swing by for chips and queso and all that, even as menu prices go up. Not this quarter, though. On Wednesday, the company posted its steepest quarterly drop in same-store sales since the 2020 slowdown in restaurant demand. And that took a sizable bite out of its share price. On Thursday, Chipotle shares dropped 13.3%, and for the week, the stock dropped, oh wow, that's neat, 13.3%. Now, it wouldn't be What's News in Markets 2025 if I didn't talk about the trade war, right? Yes, that's what I thought, too. So let's talk about Toyota, the Japanese carmaker whose U.S.-traded shares jumped on Tuesday's trade deal between the U.S. and Japan. Fun fact, Japan is the third-largest auto exporter to the U.S. after Mexico and South Korea. Under the deal, President Trump said on social media that he'd set his so-called reciprocal tariffs at 15% for the country and that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. And so, U.S.-traded shares of Toyota jumped 14% on Wednesday, and on a weekly basis, they gained roughly 12%. And now you know What's News in Markets this week. You can read about more stocks that moved on the week's news in The Score, my column in the Wall Street Journal's Exchange section. Today's show was produced by Zoe Kolkin with supervising producer Talia Arbel. I'm Francesca Fontana. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you next Saturday.

### Corporate America Is Picking Up the Tab for Trump’s Tariffs
**Publication Date:** 2025-07-25 20:48:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2574

**Full Transcript:**
How businesses connect with customers defines their brand. Sierra is the AI platform for building better, more human customer experiences. Fast answers, no canned responses, no hold music, no frustration. Visit sierra.ai to learn more. American corporations are footing the bill for Trump's tariffs, as hopes rise for a trade deal between the U.S. and Europe. Plus, banks are getting pickier about who they want to hold their credit cards. It shows that banks are cautious. The economy continues to be really, really strong, but there are some concerns. So they are hedging a bit by focusing on customers that they see as safer. And how the Trump administration is looking to strike deals with universities like it did with Colombia. It's Friday, July 25th. I'm Alex Zosola for The Wall Street Journal. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. The U.S. has collected an additional $55 billion in tariffs this year. So far, corporate America has largely shouldered the bill. Now, who's making that first payment isn't much of a mystery. Tariffs are typically paid by importers when goods reach U.S. ports, so it's usually a manufacturer, a logistics or a customs broker, or a retailer that ordered the shipment. But economists and others have been watching for signs of who will ultimately bear the cost. For more, I'm joined by Wall Street Journal economics reporter, Jean Whalen. Jean, what is the strategy for businesses to be shouldering this cost right now? Well, businesses, so far, they're paying the higher tariffs when goods arrive at port or when they buy the goods from some other company that has imported them. And the strategy is mostly they don't really know how long these tariffs are sticking around, and so they don't really want to go through the hassle of raising their prices before they're sure that the tariffs are permanent. They also don't want to raise prices quickly if their competitors are not doing it yet, so they don't want to get out of step with the competition. And in the minority of cases, they're probably concerned also about raising the ire of President Trump, who has attacked some companies, including Walmart, for announcing price increases because of tariffs. And a fourth is many of them also stocked up on a lot of goods, and so some of them are still making their way through that pre-tariff inventory and therefore don't need to raise prices on that inventory yet. Will these costs eventually get passed on to consumers? Eventually, most economists expect companies to pass this along to consumers in one way or another. The most obvious way would be to raise prices to match the tariff level. Another way companies pass on the pain to the rest of us is they don't hire as many people. They may fire people. They may not introduce as many new products that maybe we all want. They may decide that importing something is too expensive and they're not really able to charge enough to make it worth their while. What role are foreign suppliers playing in this dynamic? Broadly, foreign suppliers are not cutting their prices. So that means foreign companies are not footing the bill, and so that leaves U.S. companies and consumers to absorb the cost. At the same time, we haven't really seen consumer inflation go up very much yet, which means the rest of us are not paying too much of the cost yet. So really, it's U.S. companies so far that have been on the hook to absorb it. That was WSJ economics reporter Jean Whalen. Thanks, Jean. Sure thing. And hopes are rising for a trade deal between the U.S. and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said today that she had a good call with President Trump, and the two had agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations. According to people familiar with their thinking, European officials are optimistic that they're nearing an agreement on an outline deal that could see the European Union accept 15 percent baseline tariffs on most goods. But the people have emphasized that any agreement would need Trump's approval and could be upended if he pushes for significant additional concessions. A deal with Europe would be by far the biggest of several recent such agreements as Trump seeks to redraw international trading rules. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose today to fresh highs following a busy week of tariff updates and earnings. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent, ending the week with its fifth straight record close, its longest such streak in over a year. The Nasdaq rose about 0.2 percent, and the Dow added more than 20 points, or about half a percent. Meta platforms said it would stop political advertisements from being displayed on its social networks in the European Union starting in October, citing an incoming law designed to tackle misinformation and foreign interference in elections. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement follows a similar move from Alphabet's Google, which last November said it would halt political ads in Europe. The biggest name in Jeffrey Epstein's 2003 birthday book was a past president rather than a future one. According to people involved in putting the gift together, Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was keen for Bill Clinton and other boldface names to submit letters. In the end, she was successful. The leather-bound album, assembled before Epstein was first arrested in 2006, included a page with a single paragraph in Clinton's distinctive scrawl. A spokesman for Clinton declined to comment on the birthday message, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He referred the journal to a previous statement that the former president had cut off ties more than a decade before Epstein was arrested in 2019 and didn't know about Epstein's alleged crimes. According to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the former president was among five dozen people, including Donald Trump, Wall Street billionaire Leon Black, fashion designer Vera Wang, and media owner Mort Zuckerman, who ended up with letters in the 2003 book. Black has said he regretted having any involvement with Epstein. Zuckerman and Wang didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2023, Wang had told the journal that she regrets ever associating with Epstein.

Total new credit card openings across four major lenders fell 5% in the second quarter. That's the first decline in more than a year. But it's not affecting all customers equally. Amani Moiz, who covers personal economics for the journal, is here now with more. Amani, who are banks targeting for new credit cards? Banks really want the big spenders. People with high credit scores, people who are going to charge maybe $4,000 a month on a card and pay it off. That's who they're really going after with ads right now. If you have a lower credit score, you're probably not seeing as many credit card off piling up in your mailbox. About 80% of credit card offers in the most recent study that I saw went to people who are considered to have exceptional credit. So that means a credit score above 780. Why are they doing this? It makes sense if you're a bank to focus on this segment because they went in two ways. Big spenders, they spend more money and banks earn revenue every single time you make a purchase with your credit card. That's called interchange fees. And on the other side of it, these customers are more likely to pay off their bill in full every month. So they're less of a credit risk. What does this show us about how banks are thinking about the economy right now? It shows that banks are cautious. So overall on earnings over the past few weeks, banks said that the economy continues to be really, really strong. But there are some concerns about potential rising unemployment or how tariffs and trade tensions are going to translate for the consumer's pockets. So they are hedging a bit by focusing on customers that they see as safer. How big of a shift is this really for lenders? It's like a faucet. And they increase the flow and decrease the flow. Right now they're slightly decreasing the flow, narrowing the customers that they want to focus on. But when times are good and they think that they can make money off of more people, they're going to twist it in the opposite direction and kind of open the floodgates for credit, which we saw in 2021. That was WSJ personal economics reporter Imani Moise. Thanks, Imani. Thank you. The White House is seeking fines from several universities, it says, failed to stop anti-Semitism on campus in exchange for allowing the schools to access federal funding. That's according to a person familiar with the matter. White House correspondent Natalie Andrews joins me now. Natalie, earlier this week, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million to the federal government. How does that fit in with what the White House is asking of these other universities? The case with Columbia is going to be seen as the blueprint for how the other schools get access to their federal funding again. Cornell, Duke and Harvard are key. We know they're in talks with the administration. And this is the higher echelons of the administration there. We're looking at all sorts of agencies that deal with the Civil Rights Act and education are in talks with these schools. What have the schools said about these talks? For many of the schools publicly, this is a no comment type of issue. A lot of these schools are doing a delicate dance of wanting the funding from the administration. This is federal funding that they rely on for research, for grants. And with also their alumni, many of them who may be for more liberal leaning schools, you do not want to see them so-called caving to the administration. So it's a delicate dance for a lot of these schools who are trying to please their alumni, their faculty and also get that federal funding back. I'm curious how the deal with Columbia is going over at the university and the broader higher education community. It is not exactly what you would call something that universities love, this idea that they are going to settle with an administration. But on a wider scale, this is an issue that was very popular for Donald Trump and his campaigning. And a lot of people feel like the universities have become too liberal. So while in campus community, this may not be favorable, definitely there are audiences where it does play very well. That was WSJ White House correspondent Natalie Andrews. Thanks, Natalie. Thanks so much for having me. And police are searching for a suspect after a shooting at the University of New Mexico campus today left one person dead and another injured. The university in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said on social media it was sheltering in place following the shooting in a student apartment building early today. Adding that the shooter had a firearm and might still be on campus. School officials haven't named the shooter or the victims. The university said the surviving victims' injuries weren't life-threatening. And that's what's news for this week. Tomorrow, you can look out for our weekly markets wrap-up, What's News in Markets. Then on Sunday, we'll be discussing the audacious plan to reboot America's nuclear energy program. That's in What's News Sunday. And we'll be back with our regular show on Monday morning.
