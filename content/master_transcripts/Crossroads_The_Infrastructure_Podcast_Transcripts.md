I'm InfraLogic's Managing Editor for the Americas, Jonathan Carmody. And today we have Edward Tsai, Managing Director and Head of Real Assets and Infrastructure at Wafura. Wafura is an asset manager focused on the infrastructure sector, and it invests on behalf of its majority owner, the Public Institution for Social Security. Edward, pleasure to have you on the podcast today. Jonathan, it's a pleasure to be here. Really appreciate you having me on. Edward, can we start with a brief overview of who Wafura is and how you operate within the infrastructure space? Absolutely. So Wafura is a New York-based alternative asset management firm. We've been around since 1985. We're actually celebrating our 40th anniversary this year, and we're active primarily across three main verticals. That's GP stakes, infrastructure, which I lead, and then real estate. And then within the infrastructure business, the way we really think of ourselves is we're focused on investing in value-add opportunities in the middle market. And the way we think about that, to be value-add, it's really opportunities to have sponsor-led value creation. So whether that's in putting together a business from the ground up and scaling it or leading operational improvements or M&A, whatever that is, that's really the angle that we're looking for. And, you know, against the backdrop in the infrastructure space of increasingly larger funds and larger deals, we continue to see a lot of value in the middle market. You know, we think deals are a bit less competed in that space. The market is somewhat less efficient, and we think there's an opportunity to create attractive entry points. And then if you're successful in scaling those businesses, you have a lot more optionality at exit to a broader buyer universe. And the way we think about a lot of that is it's a middle market focus that allows us to underwrite really at a granular asset level. You also have the ability to access platform value creation, drive enterprise value. And that's a key differentiator for us where, you know, a lot of the larger sponsors, you know, they're really not reaching down below 250, 300 million of equity. That really doesn't move the needle for them. And so I think for us, you know, we're doing that work and we see a very active buyer universe to acquire good businesses that can really scale into that part of the ecosystem. So we've been active, you know, really, you know, predominantly in transportation and followed closely by digital infrastructure within kind of the positioning that I described. Excellent. Looking at Wafer's portfolio before this call and knowing your role within the business, Edward, we wanted to talk a lot about transportation assets initially in the first part of the podcast. So recently, Wafer managed to dispose of Global Container International. This is a lesser marine intermodal containers that you've done for several years. You've scaled that business up. That was sold in, I think, March to Triton International, which is backed by Brookfield for about a billion dollars, over a billion dollars as it was reported at the time. Can you talk a little bit around the thesis that Wafer has for investing in asset leasing businesses as part of its infrastructure strategy? Absolutely. Happy to. And that deal actually was signed in March and it closed a few weeks ago. So very fresh in the memory. We've been quite active across what we think of as all the major food groups within transportation asset leasing. And so that's intermodal, as you just mentioned, it's rail car, it's aviation, all different parts of the aviation lifecycle, it's trailer, it's chassis, maritime assets, and then things like warehouse and industrial equipment. And we kind of think of all that as distributed transportation infrastructure, if you will. We like all those sectors, I think, for a few simple reasons. They're physical assets, they're generally essential use, they're critical to the movement of people and goods around the world, they're generally mature technologies. And that's not just from a technological perspective, but it has the benefit of generally fairly long datasets. And that helps us understand asset value, how do those sectors behave under different marketing conditions, pricing behavior across cycles, that's a benefit as well. And you have other factors like contracted cash flows, assets generally have long economic useful lives, that latter part can be a bit of a double edged sword, if you don't have the technical resources, or you're kind of not holding them maybe in the right investment structures to kind of be able to be resilient across cycles. From the investor perspective, when we think about our investors, that all kind of combines to provide, there's a strong current income component to that, in addition to total return, there's an inflation linkage and adjusted return to ownership of the underlying physical asset itself. And then it creates diversification. I think if you look at infrastructure, more broadly, it's generally less correlated to equities or bonds, and we're seeing an era where those markets, their correlation has actually increased. Those are some of the characteristics that we look for. I think if you look at the reasons I just described, they're all kind of arguments for traditional infrastructure investment, I don't think a lot of those characteristics are necessarily new. One of the things that we're seeing really in our part of the space is that we think that there's a difference for a lot of these distributed transportation asset classes, they have some of the same characteristics, but they're just providing better unit economics versus kind of your traditional core or core plus. And then you also have the capacity for growth in a lot of those sectors. So as we think about our portfolio and what we're trying to achieve, if you can create enterprise value on top of those scaled pools of assets and operating businesses, then hopefully you're getting to something that looks more like private equity returns than core infrastructure. One of the buzzwords that's been going around the industry for some time now is resilience. And I'm thinking about how these leasing businesses fit into the infrastructure world. Some of the issues that we've seen globally with regards to supply chain volatility and certain geopolitical risks, how are you adapting to that and how are you adapting your businesses to that? Can you tell us how some of these issues are working out in geopolitics and can you give us any forward looking observations on how that will impact these kinds of infrastructure assets going forward? It's interesting, in the breadth of our activities, I think we actually see a fairly large portion of the supply chain and whether that's cargo that's going into containerized trade, going into air freighters, goods, commodities by rail, truck or barge. And each of those sectors has really reacted differently at different points in time over the last few years. And at a high level, I think what you're seeing is a realignment of priorities when we think about the global supply chain that was really built over decades to prioritize cost efficiency above all their goals. And so that was obviously driven by kind of global labor arbitrage from developed economies to other regions. And that's created just really vast amounts of physical infrastructure to support and accelerate that process. So it's not just kind of seaborne or airborne trade. It's all the inland infrastructure that's been built up over decades to handle those increasingly larger volumes of goods and help them move more efficiently. So it's the border infrastructure, it's the inland rail depots, chassis pools, switching yards, you can go on and on. It's all built up so you can service a really massive, ultra-large container vessel, 24,000 TU, taller than the Empire State Building, right? And move that through the system. So now you kind of get to the last five years and more recently, you have other priorities that are coming into focus, right? So that started maybe with the pandemic to some extent, but that's accelerating under US trade policy. And then now you have geopolitical concerns. So that's expressed in terms of, you said resiliency, you can say supply chain security, robustness, on-shoring, near-shoring, friend-shoring, whatever it is. But all of that is like that massive container vessel, it's going to take a lot of time and lots of infrastructure investment to start to effectuate those changes. And then we think private capital has a huge role in that if you look at government budgets and kind of policies around the world. So that's at a high level. As we start to kind of click down, as we see that supply chain, there is very much, in some senses, a law of unintended consequences. These are really complex supply chains that have been built up. Cost is still going to be the major driver when people make CapEx decisions. But as these other priorities come more into focus, we think that efficiency starts to not be the only focus, then the efficiency of the system will require more transportation equipment overall. And so that's something that we think we'll see in medium term in intermodal. It's something we're pursuing actively in the aviation space. So I'll give you an example where some of those complex supply chains have continued to have knock-on effects. So we're invested in a company called Aquila Air Capital. It's a aircraft engine lessor. And our thesis there is really, if you look back on the pandemic and the OEM manufacturing challenges, there are 4,000 fewer commercial passenger planes flying today in the global fleet than would have been the case without the pandemic. And then global passenger demand has exceeded 2019 levels last year. And so that's all created an environment where you have equipment that's flying aircraft that's flying for longer than they otherwise would have. You require more maintenance on older aircraft. At the same time, you have a huge talent drain from MROs and maintenance shops, which is creating a bottleneck for all of that. And so I think that creates a structural demand and under supply that is going to persist, we think, for a number of years. And Aquila is really at the heart of that, where we have a very experienced management team, very focused on the technical aspects of a very technical industry. And the demand, we think, for spare engines will only continue to increase. What we like about asset classes like that is, you know, we don't have to be against that volatility that you mentioned. We don't have to be 100% prescient about, you know, where exactly that demand is going to arise in every single period. Our assets can be on wing to any number of operators around the world, so long as the economics and jurisdiction and customer credit and things like that make sense. So we can attach to this longer term trend without needing to be millimeter precise on a large fixed asset somewhere. I'm very glad you mentioned that one. That was obviously your most recent investment in the infrastructure space, GCI, obviously being the most recent divestment. Aquila, you bought kind of at the end of 2024, as I understand it. And GCI was sold around, as you said, March, between March and June. We've seen in this kind of nine month period, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of upheaval, especially with US trade policy. Did that really affect the negotiations at all in the deal to either acquire Aquila or to sell GCI? Was that a big point of debate? And how did you reassure the counterparties in those deals? Was that all based, as you said, on your long term strategy, the long term vision, and you just have to block out the noise and keep driving ahead because you're confident in the direction of travel? It's a great question. I would be taking Intermodal Container and GCI as an example. We launched that process kind of in the late summer of last year and identified where a likely kind of buyer universe was. I would say that the US trade policy noise was probably less of a factor than you might think. And I think that's really the result of kind of a confluence of different factors. Within transportation asset leasing, I think we've seen an increasing amount of sponsor interest and activity in the space. And so that's not just our deal, but it's in the three or four deals before that. When we invested into that company initially in 2018, we saw some of those characteristics that we considered infrastructure, and we've kind of seen that play out. And so I think there is a broader, increasing amount of comfort with what are the unit economics in that business? How does that behave? This isn't the first time that there's been disruption to that industry. It's gone through several cycles. And I think that data gave us comfort and I think gives others comfort. So I think that's one factor. I think another is there's a scarcity value in some of these businesses and platforms, especially ones of a certain scale. And so as we look across that industry, when we exited, our business was number six or seven globally, and there really weren't any scale of platforms of lesser, of smaller scale. And so you had a heightened investor interest, you had consolidation, and then you kind of had this longer term thesis of what is going to happen in the next quarter, next few quarters? Is containerized trade going away? What is the demand for equipment? So I think all those things kind of combined together to mean buyer interest, we think is robust across that, because some of the characteristics of transport asset leasing, if you're being disciplined on the way you go about it, are going to be intact for a long time. Aviation is a little bit of a more nuanced story. I'd say we've been active across all parts of a life cycle. That's one that's been, because of some of those undersupply dynamics that I was describing as a competition for kind of all aircraft, especially new aircraft, mid-life aircraft, we perceive as fairly high. What we like about the engine leasing space within that broader ecosystem is that it's really, it's less of a financial product. You're not interacting necessarily with your customer's CFO office. You're really interacting with kind of their maintenance groups and their prerogatives are really just to keep aircraft in the air. So that operational aspect of it, I think, makes it a lot more defensible. It's a lot of work to kind of put together portfolios, very high touch. So we see that particular sub-segment of aviation as one where, you know, you can create outsized return, but you can also kind of grow that business for the next three, five, seven years, because some of these production issues are going to take a long time to work out from the OEMs. I want to just touch on one other transportation asset that you've invested in. You launched an FBO joint venture together with Nova Infrastructure for Hawthorne Global Aviation Services, a fixed-based operator with multiple locations in the United States. I'm curious about this one. This has proven to be a very popular asset for infrastructure investors. We look at other platforms out there like Signature Aviation or Atlantic Aviation. It seems like every infrastructure investor admires this kind of asset. They find that there's an attractive, you know, risk-adjusted premium you can extract from a business like this. How has that relationship with Nova worked out? How has that business developed? And how much room is there to grow a business like that in your strategy? That's one where the relationship with Nova has been fantastic. I think it's been a close working relationship. And it's one where we see a high level of fragmentation still within that industry. It's a platform where, you know, I think we're 14 locations going to the 17 locations. There's just a very high-touch operational aspect to our thesis there, which is it's a business that we liked quite a bit. It was really one that wasn't operated from the standpoint of kind of a single cohesive vault, right? It was one that was very regionalized, site-specific, and so didn't have kind of common pricing procurement strategies in place. And so it's one where we saw kind of the ability to be value-add as high. So it's kind of doing some of the things that kind of just make sense of unifying the business. It's augmenting the leadership team at the company. And then it's pursuing, you know, bolt-on M&A. So acquired a number of businesses kind of out of the gate, you know, closing on some additional site locations. And as we're putting that together and scaling it, you know, I think there are opportunities because, you know, going back to the theme of platform scarcity, we think that's going to be well-positioned to benefit not just from kind of investor interest, you know, from kind of the larger sponsors, but sponsors who are looking to get into the space or have a thesis of continuing to grow and scale that business. It's one where it's kind of that traditional, I would say, private equity toolkit that we really approached kind of the value-add space and infrastructure with. Our underwriting is always kind of at that asset level, you know, what is this site producing or the economics of this business kind of at a fundamental level? But then I think if you're able to kind of roll up your sleeves and do some of that operational work, do some of the M&A, I think that's where you can kind of access platform and enterprise value. Moving on to a topic that's very close to our hearts here at Infralogic, we're very interested in the blurring lines between real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. Now, within your alternative real asset strategy, how closely do you work with the real estate business? And how many opportunities are you finding with that side of the business where those strategies are converging either in a single deal or a single kind of investment thesis? The way we segment real estate into what we call, and maybe it's just our term, but alternative real estate and traditional real estate. And alternative real estate to us really just means real estate businesses that have a large operational component where you're not just kind of outsourcing the operating aspects of the underlying asset. And in fact, you're kind of, you're driving a lot of the value of the asset in the business by developing and operating it. And we see that as hand in hand in a lot of ways with kind of what we're doing in infrastructure. Sometimes we cross staff those teams. Organizationally, that alternative real estate business, we run very closely with infrastructure. There's that natural intersectionality. And so we want to make sure that those teams are collaborating together, sharing pipeline meetings, kind of looking at opportunities. The toolkit that we're bringing to those businesses has a lot of similarities. As we think about that convergence, it's a really interesting topic because I think infrastructure, as you know, has continued to evolve and expand and segment over time. We've kind of observed the phenomenon of once asset classes kind of become accepted as infrastructure, right? There's an evolution in the cost of capital of that asset class. So we talked about intermodal containers, that was an industry where 15 years ago, that was probably the province of private equity funds before it kind of moved into core plus and core. We've seen that in other sectors. So Marinos is a business where we were the anchor investor in Suntex Marinos back in 2015, kind of built that up and exited in 2021. Now you've seen infrastructure move into the marina sector with the acquisition of Safe Harbor and really a headline grabbing weight. So I think that search for asset classes that have those inherent infra characteristics will continue. So long as you have capital flowing to the sector and there's high competition for scaled assets. Now, I think the key question that I think about is that lower cost of capital always justified, right? Does it have those core infra characteristics like resiliency and lower correlation, inflation protection that really justify that movement along the cost of capital curve? And so I think for us, when we think about where we draw that line, it's really the physical asset linkage. I'm not saying we're necessarily correct in where we draw the line, but that's kind of what we've historically come to and what's worked for us. And so you've seen things like social infra, infra services. And so for us, it's always a judgment call, but I think where we see businesses that are truly asset light or revenue is really non-asset driven, then I think in those cases, we ask ourselves the question of what is the appropriate cost of capital? And we're careful not to apply a lower cost to that just because it's being called infrastructure. And if I remember correctly, the previous investment of Wafers back in 2020 was into Colony Capital, which obviously became Digital Colony. They have vantaged data centers and is now Digital Bridge. I think you did divest from the Digital Bridge investment management sector, but you still retain an interest in Intermountain Infrastructure Group, a long haul fiber developer, and also Mission Clean Energy developing utility scale solar battery storage products for the industry. In terms of kind of digital infrastructure, which obviously with data centers is a key concern for the real estate and the infrastructure communities, how do you see Wafers participation in that space? And how do you see those businesses working together to solve the conundrum that everybody's tackling these days in terms of how to power the data centers? As we think about kind of some of these mega trends, I think we talked about supply chain, I think digitalization is clearly another one. We want to remain focused on being in the value add part of that segment and the scale of capital that's going into data centers, hyperscale, kind of the entrenched competitive advantages of scale platforms like advantage data centers where we're still an investor. That isn't where we see ourselves being differentiated. So it's going to some of the second and third order derivatives like long haul fiber, where we kind of see the opportunity for us today. So you mentioned IIG, that's a very successful business building long haul fiber in Pacific Northwest. That's underlined by kind of the fiber asset itself, as well as long term kind of off day contracts from some of your very big corporate users. And similarly to in the hyperscale data center space where you kind of see like a step change in magnitude of demand. And then we're seeing the same thing in things like long haul fiber. We're seeing the same thing in demand for power and we're seeing the same thing in demand for equipment. So just your ability to get enough transmission equipment on site is becoming a bottleneck. I think as we think about all that, mission is one way to think about kind of those second third order derivatives on the power side and maybe potentially co-locating assets or having kind of strategic partnerships with some of the large corporates in the space. And then IIG, I think is kind of another way of thinking about the other side of that equation, which is fiber availability. The intersection between as we think about real estate and infrastructure, part of the reason we have an organizational structure that kind of brings those two together is that while we're looking at many of the same attributes and asset classes, and I think people come to data centers from both the real estate side and from the infrastructure side, we do want to be conscious of kind of like what are the relative strengths of those different perspectives. And so infrastructure, we tend to think of as having that operational component, private equity like in mindset when we think about management teams and aligning incentives. I think real estate can really bring a complementary skill set when it comes to things like development, construction, managing those processes. That's a little bit how we think about it. I won't say that we have perfectly solved where is that bright line between those asset classes. I think there are cases where we are in the car wash sector through alternative real estate. We view that very much as a real estate sector. Other asset classes, they're maybe more firmly in infrastructure, but there are industries which I think are firmly gray zones today. Absolutely. And we'll be putting out some pieces in the near future, which will look at exactly that topic of convergence of infrastructure and real estate. Edward, it's been really interesting to talk to you today and hear more about the nuances behind Wafura's investment strategy across infrastructure and alternative real estate. Thank you very much for joining us on the podcast today. Jonathan, it's been a pleasure. Thanks so much for having me on. So this is Jonathan Carmody, Americas Managing Editor, signing off. Thank you for listening to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast, available wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Jonathan Carmody. I'll see you next time.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-07-24 21:31:18+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Macquarie execs discuss changing landscape of US energy\n**Episode ID:** 4431\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello, and welcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. I'm Chuck Stanley, senior energy reporter for InfraLogic, and today I have the distinct privilege of speaking with two senior members of the Macquarie Asset Management Team. Aaron Rubin is the head of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets Energy Investment Team in North America, and Will Demmes is the senior managing director and head of Americas for Macquarie's Green Investment Team. We are living in interesting times, as the saying goes. Donald Trump's return to the White House in January has driven an about-face in U.S. energy policy objectives, from the Biden administration's emphasis on climate and sustainability to a preference under Trump for conventional firm power. On top of that, the ongoing rollercoaster around the Trump administration's tariff initiatives has injected new uncertainty into supply chains throughout the energy and infrastructure sectors, and the recently passed GOP budget bill has rewritten the landscape for energy incentives in the United States. Will and Aaron bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the show, and while they said they agree more often than not with regard to trends they see in the market, it's a great time to have them both on the show to give a well-rounded perspective on where the challenges and opportunities are out there in these uncertain times. Will, Aaron, thanks so much for joining us today. Thanks for having us, Chuck. Yeah, thank you, Chuck. I'm looking forward to the conversation. As am I. And most of our listeners will no doubt be familiar with Macquarie's work in the global energy and infrastructure sector, but I'd love to start off by having each of you tell the audience a little bit about your roles with the firm and what situations you primarily work on. Will, would you like to go first? Thanks, Chuck. As you mentioned, I lead our green investment team here in the Americas, but the green investment team is a global team, so we are actually active across the globe. Macquarie as an institution has been investing in energy transition, whether it's offshore wind, solar molecules, for 20 years, and we've deployed almost $20 billion into the sector. And so we've been investors in the sector for a while now, and so it's really ingrained in our institution. And as such, we've created a dedicated team that's focusing on the sector, and that team has been around since 2017 when we acquired the UK Green Investment Bank. And since then, we've built out that team and have subsequently raised a number of dedicated funds for our LPs and clients that are more pure play green investment strategies. Aaron will tell you about his strategy as well, but the areas that we're focusing on are really twofold. Number one, the decarbonization of the power sector, so that's solar and wind, geothermal hydro batteries, and then also the decarbonization of the industrial sector. We're currently focusing on things like renewable fuels, green and blue hydrogen, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, circular economy, and clean grid. So it's a pretty wide mandate, and combined with sort of the flagship Macquarie strategies, I think we really cover a very wide opportunity set within the energy infrastructure world. I'm Aaron Rubin, I lead our energy investment team in the Americas, as you said, Chuck. My focus areas include regulated utilities, water, gas and electric, which has been a really big target sector for us globally for over 20 years, as well as unregulated energy opportunities defined quite broadly for our diversified infrastructure funds. So that includes midstream power and a wide variety of other things. Will's team and mine collaborate very closely and we really try to adopt a holistic investment approach. We physically sit next to each other and a lot of our focus areas are pretty complementary. So for example, some of the biggest portfolio companies in my portfolio are electric utilities in the US, whereas some of Will's biggest focus is with wind and solar and battery developers. Our utilities have got a huge demand to build and install that sort of generation. So you can immediately see how the collaboration between those companies can add a lot of value on both sides. And it definitely seems like a busy and complicated time to be operating in all of these spaces. I appreciate you guys taking the time to appear on the show and share your thoughts. As I indicated in the intro, this year has seen some major shifts in the investment environment around energy, renewables and the energy transition, both from a policy standpoint and macroeconomic trends. Renewables investors have been telling me that the uncertainty in particular can create real challenges when talking about long-term commitments in this space. Will, approaching this market from the standpoint of a green investment focus, are there particular sectors or types of deals where you do see more opportunity to be active right now? And do you see a bit more certainty emerging within the policy landscape as we get sort of further into this first year of the Trump administration? I'll start by saying again that we are a global strategy. So uncertainty really is relative to what's happening here in the U.S., but obviously that impacts the global opportunity. But I'll focus today on the U.S. because I think that's what you're alluding to in terms of uncertainty. But obviously we've benefited for over 20 or 30 years from the tax credits that were helping accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in the United States. And it was always kind of uncertain before the IRA. Every other year, basically, it was being renewed and there was always a bit of uncertainty in whether it would be renewed or not. So we've dealt with this, right? And not saying that's the way we want to deal with it, but we've kind of grown up with this uncertainty and we thought it was resolved with the Inflation Reduction Act. But obviously what's going on right now is somewhat unwinding the certainty that act intended to provide. That's okay. We believe that the fundamentals of particularly wind and solar in this increased load and demand environment still holds true. And while the uncertainty around whether or not the support will be there or not, we actually don't believe that we need it. Right. And that's maybe a bit of a controversial statement. We haven't changed our view in terms of the opportunity set based on today's uncertainty. We just, as an investor, certainty is always better than not. Right. Despite the outcome of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and sort of the wind down of the credits earlier than expected, at least that gave us certainty and sort of where things were heading, or we thought that was the case. But, you know, shortly after there was an executive order that kind of asked the agencies to look at how you actually qualify for those credits in the next short period of time, which creates more uncertainty because the strategies of how to safe harbor and qualify your projects such that you have an extended time to actually get those credits. But the next 45 days, I guess the next 40 days or so, that's under review. And so there's a bit more uncertainty on whether the strategies we've used in the past will be applicable to what we're doing going forward. But I'd say that just having sort of the meat of the changes to the IRA understood has given us a lot of comfort and confidence. A little more clarity, but some major questions still to be addressed, sounds like. Yeah. And I'd say just to your other question around opportunities that we're seeing, I think in the U.S. specifically, we've already been very long as a green investment team and as Macquarie generally in green field developments and creating platforms that are developing and creating new assets. I think we're probably still very interested in that and will continue to support our portfolio companies that are doing that. But we are also shifting a bit to focus more mature businesses, more operating assets to really complement the existing portfolio that we have. So we're looking at a number of those large IPPs, both public and private. We think there's a dislocation in the public market and the private market on these renewable IPPs. So we're evaluating many of those opportunities and seeing if it makes sense to partner with them and potentially take them private. Very interesting. And Aaron, could you maybe speak to how the changing dynamics of the market and the policy landscape have shifted your focus with regard to the type of opportunities you are pursuing? Not to minimize the role of federal policy, but I really think the biggest change in the U.S. investment landscape for energy in, call it the last two years, has been the resurgence of demand for energy and in particular electricity, which is in part a function of the dramatic growth in the data center industry and in part the trends in electrification that we had seen growing for a long time. That has translated into a huge amount of capital that needs to go into the ground to support it, whether it be pipelines, gas-fired power, LNG exports to take cheap U.S. energy internationally, investments in utility infrastructure to support all of that. It's really a generational opportunity at the moment. So identifying investment opportunities that are emerging from that, and as you can see from the examples I gave, there are a lot of them, is probably the top of our list. On the policy side, the federal policy has certainly made some sectors easier to invest in and others more difficult. I think state policy doesn't get quite the focus, but particularly in power, it's really important. One of our large utility investments, for instance, is an electric utility in Washington, Puget Sound Energy. That's got a legal mandate from the state of Washington to decarbonize the electricity sector. So loss of federal support will make that a little more expensive to do, and we've got to work hard to make sure that the impact on ratepayers is mitigated. But we spend a lot of time looking at how we build new renewable generation to achieve that in Washington. That state law pre-existed the IRA. We don't expect it's going to change with the IRA going away. So that remains a big focus. And to your point, at Infralogic, one thing that we are hearing over and over again is that demand is going to be in the driver's seat with regard to energy for at least the rest of the decade, perhaps longer. Whoever can deliver electrons to the data centers, other hyperscalers, and the utilities is going to be in a pretty good position. But at the same time, it does sound like uncertainty over the policy landscape. How are supply chains going to be able to meet the demand for development in the U.S.? The differences between those state policies, the fact that those may represent some moving targets as well. Those all create uncertainty and challenges for the investment in the near term, regardless of what technology you're pursuing. I'm curious, does that type of dynamic change the way you weigh the risks over time for different opportunities? The demand opportunity creates a lot of incentive for people to come up with creative solutions. While it creates novel problems, I think we've got a lot of confidence that they will eventually be solved. To your question about changing policy specifically, yes, certainly. Infrastructure investment as an asset class is supposed to deliver our investors a relatively low risk exposure. Overriding capital-intensive projects that don't have a high degree of certainty around their revenue streams is difficult, and when there are policy changes that threaten the certainty of those revenue streams, then clearly it makes it harder to finance new assets. I think that that theme really only applies to a small minority of assets in the scheme of things. If you look at all of the asset classes I mentioned before, whether it's LNG, whether it's utility CAPEX, whether it's pipelines, whether it's a lot of the renewable sectors that Will's focused on, the underlying demand will create certainty of revenue that will ultimately get those projects built. We generally have a pretty high degree of confidence in the investment landscape. I would agree with all that Aaron has said. I think when we talk about the growth in demand, I think most of the listeners here will be familiar with the stat that demand in the U.S., low growth in the U.S. for the last 20 or 30 years has been stagnant, but now we're projecting 2%, 3%, 4% per year over the next few decades, which is coming, obviously, from not just AI and data centers, but also the electrification of the industrial sector and electrification of everything, really. That trend has really come through only in the last year or two. The way that we underwrite many of the investments that we underwrote before a year or two ago, we did not assume this type of growth. In fact, a lot of those investments look in the money right now based on that demand growth. I think going forward, acknowledging that there's maybe more growth opportunity than in the past, we'll continue to be quite conservative in our assumptions on the growth of the market, even though we know there's a meaningful upside if things continue to grow at the pace it currently is. So it's about being a good investor, being a smart investor, and not sort of investing into the trend, but investing into what your mandate is and a reasonable underwriting case. So I think that's really important to remember, even in this hyper growth world, good investors shouldn't be assuming that's definitely going to happen. And that's true on both the power side, as well as the other side of our strategy, which is the decarbonization of the industrial sector. We believe that there still is, from a demand side, there's strong demand still from corporates and utilities to get clean products. We don't assume they're willing to pay more for it, and fortunately, the sectors we're investing in, we don't assume that someone's going to pay more for an electron because it's clean, or someone's going to pay more for a renewable fuel because it's clean. And so we still see that demand, and so we continue to believe that the investments we've made and will make are investing into growing sectors that will continue to offer market opportunity. Chuck, you started the question by talking about data centers and demand coming from that. We have the good fortune to be one of the large global investors in hyperscale data centers as well. So Will and I, we have a lot of opportunity to collaborate with our partners and portfolio companies in that space. And what we're seeing there is a customer set where the capital needs of the data centers themselves dwarf even the very large costs of providing energy to those data centers. So the hyperscalers are incredibly savvy customers. They need to be served well, they need to be given cost competitive products, but at the same time, the value of their product means that there is a lot of ability to fund innovative and creative solutions to energy supply. It's certainly changing the way utilities have to think about it. Utilities have to be a lot more nimble in evolving their business model, but certainly the ones that we work closely with, deploying huge amounts of resources to go through that evolution and make sure that they can capture that market growth. And as we see some of these massive data centers continue to develop and come online, do you expect to see sort of more repetition or more sort of, you know, repeatable approaches to delivering power to these massive data centers? Or is it going to continue to be more of a bespoke solution for each of these projects? I'd kick off. I think we're still figuring it out. Number one, I don't have a very clear response for you, but the amount of opportunity that there is, you'd hope that over some time there would be some strategies that are developed to make that process more efficient. Obviously, power is the biggest constraint for a new data center development and construction. Our grid is not in a great shape. There's massive ambitions from the hyperscalers to build a lot of data centers, and I think we need to take that with a bit of grain of salt. Not that they do want to build a lot of data centers, but without power, they won't be able to do it, right? So there's got to be an intersection between the business strategies of the data centers and hyperscalers, as well as the power providers. So we see a lot of opportunity to collaborate. As Aaron said, we have a very large data center investment with many investments, but one of our largest ones is a company called Align Data Centers. We brainstorm, we collaborate with them to figure out how we can solve each other's issues. So there's already collaboration in the sector. So I hope that from that, something emerges that is less bespoke and more rinse, wash and repeat. I haven't seen that come together yet, but I don't know if Aaron has a different experience. That industry has been moving so quickly and growing at an exponential rate. So the innovative solutions that people came up with six months ago are outdated already. The overriding trend is towards scale, I think, and having solutions which are able to deliver new capacity to these customers at large scale are probably the models that are going to continue to get built on. It's kind of an ever evolving thing. Yeah, that's right. Just going back to the broader trend towards demand growth, you know, really kind of driving activity in the sector. We've heard much more enthusiasm going back into the gas value chain over the past six months or a year. I'm curious, Aaron, if you might want to start off speaking about where you see, you know, the strongest opportunities, you named some subsectors where you guys are interested in within sort of the near to medium term, whether midstream, generation, more towards the LNG value chain. What sort of balance do you look to strike and where do you see the greatest opportunities? Part of the context for gas investment, I think, has got to be what's happened with coal and oil. If you look back just to the start of the shale revolution 15 years ago, coal was producing about half of the electricity for the U.S. Today, it's about 15 percent. So renewables in wind, solar and batteries have grown very rapidly over that time. But most of that has been displaced by gas. So gas has made a pretty huge contribution to the decarbonisation of the U.S. already. And now that we're losing those coal plants and we're seeing more intermittent generation drive the decarbonisation of the electric system, we're also seeing an increased understanding that, at least in the medium term, it's got to be paired with firm gas generation. You know, we're seeing more extreme weather events. We're seeing the loss of that solid fuel generation take reliable generation capacity out of electric generation stack. So even places which have got a really firm commitment to decarbonisation, I think, are starting to realise that gas is part of the solution for a fairly long period of time. Obviously, gas fired generation is a hydrocarbon technology. So in and of itself, it's not net zero. But I think we've got increasing confidence that gas fired generation put in place today to firm the system is going to be a long term part of the solution. And ultimately, you'll see reduced capacity factors over time, and eventually replacement with hydrogen, carbon capture, biofuels, other technologies that take us all the way to net zero. The focus on gas is going to prove to be right and consistent with an overall commitment to net zero. On the international space, even though the US has pretty rapidly reduced its coal consumption, coal consumption has come down by over 50% in the last 10 years, globally, it's continued to increase. So part of this journey is going to be taking cleaner gas burning technologies and displacing that internationally. So that will require a lot of investment in LNG, it'll require a lot of investment in pipelines. And in fact, we made investments in three pipelines that take gas from Texas into Mexico in the last last couple of years, their purpose is going to be replacing old oil fired generation capacity with new much cleaner gas fired capacity in Mexico as an example. So all of those investment opportunities are going to continue to be a big focus for us as well as the whole industry. As Aaron mentioned, a few times as an institution, Macquarie believes in the in the journey to net zero. But we've always been realistic that gas for some period of time is required to help transition to that point in time. So we haven't slowed down our investments in gas. Of course, we're very conscious of the climate impact, but you can't solve everything overnight. Number one. Number two, with the growing demand, I'll be the first to tell you, you can't satisfy it all with just solar and wind today, there's not a real baseload solution, costs will need to come down around batteries before we get to a clean baseload solution. So we're realistic and practical about the importance of gas in our economy. We do want to continue the retirement of coal. So we're not investing in coal anywhere in our institution. But even within the green strategy, there are opportunities to support the build out of new cleaner gas, as Aaron was alluding to. And that's, you know, as you said, renewable fuels, or whether that's carbon capture on new build green fuel gas generation. Within our strategy, we'd look at it with Aaron, we would look at it in partnership. Within our energy transition strategy, there is scope to look at clean natural gas investments. And so there aren't too many that make economic sense. But as costs come down, we'll continue to evaluate those and keep that within our strategy. And while keeping on sort of the same track, early in the conversation, you gave your view on sort of the core renewables, the momentum behind them, the fact that they do have a track record of viability and profitability that maybe they don't need the sort of policy support in order to continue to grow that they've had in past years. I'd love to hear your thoughts on some of the more emerging technologies you mentioned, renewable fuels, geothermal, or some of the opportunities within industrial decarbonization that you're looking at. Where do those stand? And where do you see the greatest opportunity? Ironically, maybe not ironically, but the reality is that those sectors you just mentioned actually got more support after the OBBBA. So there's more support for blue hydrogen. There's more support for renewable fuels. There's more support for geothermal. There's obviously more support for our favorite source of energy generation, nuclear. And so those sectors, I actually expect to see some level of increased activity. A lot of those sectors still have technological breakthrough and cost downs that need to happen before it makes sense. But that's what the role of those subsidies are. So obviously, those technologies and businesses are within the scope of many of the oil and gas companies in the country. And so there's support there for that. The one area that I'd say is probably pretty challenged is green hydrogen. And that's for many reasons. And Aaron, I'd love to hear your thoughts on where the opportunities are with regard to emerging technologies. What opportunities might we see emerge over the next year or two or three opportunities for technologies that might not have been right for infrastructure investment in the past, or areas where we might see a growth in opportunity in the coming years? We'd focus a lot of this discussion in changes to the federal policy that had been supporting some of those emerging technologies. There are a lot of technologies that were part of the IRA. And some of the technologies actually continue to receive quite a lot of federal support. Ironically, many of these technologies that have been around for quite a long time, like geothermal and renewable fuels, ones that we've invested in for many, many years, but had seen additional support coming out of the federal government. So I think evolution of those kinds of technologies, which have got a good track record already and have accelerated to meet the energy transition need with more federal support, probably offer the clearest path. Some of the other technologies which are newer, hydrogen's got a lot of focus, may be a little bit more challenged given the change in federal support. But again, one has to recognize that the US isn't the only place that is trying to develop these technologies and Europe, just as one example, has continued to focus fairly heavily on them. So I don't think changing policy landscape in the US is the be all and end all of technological growth in energy transition. All right. Well, and hopefully we will have the opportunity to expand the conversation sometime in the near future to those other markets and other regions and what opportunities you're seeing there. Unfortunately, we have run out of time for this episode of Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. Aaron and Will, thank you so much for joining us.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, senior editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Joining us today is David Reister, a managing partner at Segway Sustainable Infrastructure. David, thank you for joining the podcast. Happy to be here, Andrew. So today we are going to discuss the one big beautiful bill that was signed into law this past weekend. We're recording this on July 9th. Now, Segway has done some really good detailed analysis of what the impact of that bill is likely to be, both for renewable investment and for deployment. And that's one of the reasons that I was really eager to have David on. But before we get into that, David, can you tell me a little bit about your background in the renewable energy industry? Sure, Andrew. So I have spent most of my career in renewable energy. I had a few years in venture capital in the first five years of my career, but then shifted over in the early days of SunEdison into the solar and broader renewable space. That whole time I've either been bouncing between project finance roles or investment roles on various investment teams. So I'm kind of a token finance guy. But over the years, I've certainly become pretty competent in a lot of the areas of development and build on operating of solar power plants. The group I co-founded at SunEdison was called the Global Special Situations Group, very grandiosely named, and we spun out from there and created an investment firm called GSSG Solar, which was the start of my sort of development capital investment experience. We focused on the Japanese market at a time when there was a very lucrative feed-in tariff there. I've also spent some years running project finance teams, including the project finance team at Cypress Creek, kind of during its heyday. When I left there in 2019, I wanted to bring some of the success we had at GSSG Solar doing development stage investments and bring that into the U.S. and Canadian markets. Through my whole career, I was always sitting in the spot where people were asking me to find development capital for pre-construction, and it was always the scarcest thing, the sticky gear in the machine. We figured out how to do it well in Japan, and I wanted to bring that to the U.S. market. That's what Segway is. It's a strategy focused on the pre-NTP phases of a project for solar, wind, storage, and transmission projects. It's a private equity structure. We were founded about four years ago, currently investing out of our second fund. We have about $300 million in assets under management. By design, it kind of has to be that size or smaller because the check sizes tend to be fairly small. It's a little bit of a stay small and stay very focused sort of strategy. We've got 14 people. Half of them are in San Francisco, half are scattered around. We make investments at all stages of development. Sure, sometimes it's just posting a few deposits three months before NTP, but more frequently, it's an earlier stage investment. It's just some smart people with a circle on a map. But in all cases, we partner with a frontline development partner. Sometimes that's just one person. Sometimes it's a bigger shop of 40, 50 people. When you make these early stage investments, it's fairly expensive money. We're prepared to lose all of our money on projects that die, and that does happen. So there aren't that many groups doing this because it's a pretty uncomfortable strategy for a lot of folks that have been underwriting to protecting the downside for their whole career. This is a situation where you're not always going to be able to protect your downside and you need to have a few things that go really well. We sell at NTP or DevComplete somewhere in that zone. And when we sell, the liquidity is sort of shared between us and our frontline development partner. Sometimes that's nothing. Sometimes it's a failure. Sometimes things go really well and we get a 5x. But in the aggregate, of course, one hopes that the fund level returns come up pretty good. And so far they have. Expensive money, but developers keep their autonomy. They have aligned capital partners, a pretty useful group of people that want the same results, and you get a chance to maximize your project value by carrying it deeper into the development cycle. And I think that business model has been generally well received. But of course, the connection to what we're talking about here is that we constantly make decisions about whether to keep projects alive or kill them. And they're very difficult decisions always. And this bill makes it a lot harder. It introduces a number of new variables into figuring out can and should this project carry on further and get more capital support? And that's why we decided to do the analysis because it's one of the things we do every day is figure out what is the risk adjusted return of moving this project along and how do we make those decisions at a portfolio level such that we get good aggregate returns? And it's a tricky part of the job and it's particularly tricky right now. Yeah, absolutely. And obviously we've seen a lot of people and spoken to a lot of people who are opinionated and have views of what's going to happen with the one big, beautiful bill throughout the process. But very few have put it into numbers and done the type of detailed analysis that I think Segway has. And Segway has really done it every step of the way from the first time something passed out of the House to the Senate bill. So we've been able to see how the potential impact changes as there are changes to the bill. So looking now, now that we have a final bill that's been signed, can you give a little bit of a synopsis about how you think what we ended up with is likely to impact the industry? Of course, it's still a slightly moving target because we're all taking educated guesses at what this executive order means for the ultimate treasury guidance. But the battle to get this bill to limit the damage as much as possible was very focused on having a start of construction standard with a long enough window to allow folks to, in an organized and diligent fashion, decide which projects deserved and warranted the investment necessary to safe harbor the projects to get the 30% ITC. And the start of construction standard offers a little bit more flexibility than just a hard placed in service cliff on the back end, which would of course make construction financing very difficult because there's just this binary risk, the sort of Damocles kind of hanging out there for you. With the start of construction standard, you probably end up having a longer window as far as when projects are actually finished, whether or not they still get the ITC or not. And that was really the main focus together with keeping transferability in the mix because transferability has proven really healthy for the market. And then of course, getting storage carved out, which somewhere along the way, we realized that it didn't quite have the same stigmas on it as solar and wind had it. And there was a pathway to get it kind of carved out from all this. So it's a very weird place to be, to be demonized in this fashion as a sector. And we're all sort of licking our wounds because let's just say some very big punches were just landed and it looks like they're not quite done. Can you quantify it? What would you say are the headline numbers in terms of what impact this bill is going to have two years from now, five years from now, how much less renewables is going to end up on the grid and how many less dollars are going to go into the sector based on what we know now? Yeah, I think so. Our estimate on the last, on the bill that was passed is that they're relative to status quo and our status quo line is complicated because it includes sort of a pretty healthy dose of projects that are currently in the queue dying of natural causes, as we call them, which is to say not from an exogenous policy event like this, but just dying because they can't get a permit or dying because the interconnection costs are too expensive or dying because you can't find somebody to pay for the electricity. Those are sort of natural causes of death and those establish our status quo line, which over the next five years, that status quo line has a little over 500 gigawatts being placed in service in the US market. Our final analysis of the bill had a little less than 100 gigawatts of that being canceled. Those lines were worse. We've put out some graphs that kind of show in the different versions of the bill, how it moved around. This is the second best of all the different versions put out was this last bill, but it's still an awful lot of capacity that's killed. It's 141 billion of canceled investment. A lot of the storage that's carved out from this is going to become less interesting, which is something that we have not quite quantified in there is what sort of diminishing returns on storage if you have less solar and wind coming on the grid. It's a big deal. It lands in a sort of probably short of a catastrophe spot where at one point we were estimating as much as 240 gigawatts in the house bill. That was our estimate for the canceled power plants would be 245 gigawatts. So relative to that house bill, this is about a third as damaging, and that's mostly due to the start of construction standard that ended up making it into the final bill, which was extremely hard fought. But we'll see. Part of our analysis made a big assumption, which was that the references in the bill to old IRS notices about what start of construction actually means, the lawmakers obviously intended for this bill to pick up that same very well-established standard. And we now have an executive order out that is explicitly saying they don't want that standard to be applied. And there are versions of how this plays out from here where our estimate of a little under 100 gigawatts being canceled ends up being way too optimistic because the start of construction standard won't really mean anything if they change the definition of that in a very severe way. That's interesting. And obviously, that's kind of a new development. I think even a new development since your latest analysis came out, correct? Correct. Going back to the analysis, though, when you look at the, let's say, lost gigawatts that are expected, what are the main drivers of that? What are the clauses or law changes that are going to be most damaging? So the right way to think about this, and it gets a little bit nuanced, something a lot of people said to me over the last six weeks is if there's all this demand out there, which is what you're telling me is true, and that's why we can't pass this bill that cuts off a lot of capacity, there's all this demand that needs to be served, and you're telling me that wind and solar are, from an LCOE standpoint, the cheapest and quickest way to get power available to offtakers on the grid, such as a data center, then what's the problem? Why don't you just accept the end of the subsidy if your product is that good and there's all this demand? What's the problem? And the problem is of a sequencing nature. That point is well taken, and I think in the long term, correct. In the long term sort of equilibrium, maybe eight to 10 years out, something like that, we don't need a subsidy. And competing on a level playing field with all other forms of power, there will be many, many applications and places in America where solar and wind installations will play a huge role, usually coupled with storage. The problem is what happens on the way there and how much we fall behind in all of the sectors that require a lot of power. And the sequencing problem I'm talking about is this. At the time that you need to decide to put more money into a project, you've got a $2 million need or a $10 million posting, right? You have to look into the future and assess the probability that the project ends up having value, margin in it, how far out you think that's going to be, and what that value creation looks like, right? The probability of a win and what the win looks like and when it arrives. At the time that we are asked to make a lot of these big investment decisions in projects that are impacted by the bill, we won't know certain things like how quickly is the demand side of the market going to understand that they need to absorb higher prices because supply is going down and the cost of that supply is going up. Will they understand that immediately? Some will. Some of the data center developers understand exactly what's happening and they're saying, I'll sign the new price. I need the power. But a lot of the offtakers of electricity are regulated or stubborn or less sophisticated and they don't know what price they should renegotiate it to. And therefore, you don't know if you have a project that's worth anything, right? So if you have a project right now in 2030, and this is true for us in 10 or so cases, we got a PPA for a project that's meant to place in service in 2030. And somebody, the offtaker comes to us or the utility that's doing the interconnection comes to us and says, okay, you got to post $30 million of deposits across these two projects. A lot of it's going to be at risk. So you have to come up with the money and you have to expose it to the possibility of losing it if you don't finish the project. But the PPAs that we won were set to prices from four months ago that assumed a 30% ITC would be in place. Now, in the end, does that offtaker need the power enough to behave rationally and renegotiate the price that's in the PPA? Maybe, probably, in a lot of cases, yes, but we won't know that in that example and many others. We won't know the answer to that until well after the time that we have to invest a significant amount of money into the project to keep it alive. And that sort of timing sequencing problem in the end, yes, we probably end up fine in most cases, but which ones are the most that work out and which ones are the ones where you can't find an agreeable price for electricity with an offtaker? We don't know which are which. And you can't just take a leap off of a cliff with that saying, ah, it'll work out in the end with some of these check sizes. They're really significant amounts of money that completely rely upon, in the end, an offtaker paying 25%, 30% more than they were paying before for the electricity. And you just don't know if and when the answer to that will be, yes, they're ready. And so a lot of products will die. You have to be a responsible fiduciary. Doing that is gambling. It's not investing, right? I can't put that amount of capital exposed to something I have absolutely no control over that won't reveal itself for a couple of years. So, David, just to a little bit flesh out the other side of that discussion, the argument is that because of data centers, AI, there's a growing need for power. And other than renewables, when you look at the next five years, there's just nothing that's going to be ready. So at the end of the day, these offtakers need that power, and they're not going to be able to use other sources. Nuclear is not ready. Coal is not realistic. And gas turbines, the components are not going to be available until 2029, 2030 at the earliest. So at the end of the day, they're going to need that power and whatever the economics pencil out at, that's what they're going to pay. So what you're saying is that it'll take more time for that equilibrium to be reached than it will to the time you have to make those decisions. Am I summarizing that accurately? Yes, that's right. I think that equilibrium or proof of that theory will arrive with time slowly, and it's not going to be true in every instance, right? And that sort of equilibrium of they need the power and you're the only ones that can build it in this next five-year window, therefore, this has to work out, it sounds right. It is right in a microeconomics 201 class, but in practice, supply doesn't always meet demand at the local level perfectly, right? We may have developed a project thinking could be a data center offtaker, but this utility will probably want it. It's not always developed directly to the sort of demand that is likely to hell or high water their way to saying yes to a new price. To what extent exactly that hypothesis is true, which is that they'll have no other choice but to pay whatever they need to pay for this electricity. While we wait for that to prove itself out or come into focus, a lot of investment decisions have to be made that are very hard to responsibly make if you don't know which of those projects are going to clear in this sort of new market. It might be that half of our projects in the end, there's an offtaker that says, well, I don't want to pay this much more, but I have to. Which half is it? We don't know. It's very hard to know at this point when you've got a project that's going to place in service in four years. So you end up just kind of shrugging your shoulders and saying, I don't control this outcome. It's going to work out a lot of the time, but not all the time. What do I do with that? So maybe a rough parallel. It was a little bit of a different situation. But a few years ago, we had basically a slew of PPAs that had been reached at a certain price with the assumption that costs would keep coming down. And then you had some of the supply chain issues. You had inflation. And it became clear that the projects just could not be built economically at those PPA prices. And you saw a lot of renegotiations. How is this different? And are there ways that this is similar than that? If anything, you have kind of this one big event that might be easier to predict in some ways, right? Yeah, I think that comp from 2021 is a good one. It's the best one we have. And that experience, I think, surprised a lot of developers and investors in portfolios and projects in that the price and elasticity was more favorable than we all imagined or most of us imagined. That is to say, offtakers were more willing to change their price than people thought they would be. And many moved quicker than we thought they would. But here's the thing. There's sort of a selection bias with that. The stories that you hear about from that era are the ones where somebody changed their PPA price. And it all worked out great in the end. You don't have a lot of people going around telling the story about the projects that they unceremoniously killed because the cost went up by 22 cents. And they sort of just decided they had to focus on other ones where the offtaker was willing to change the price. There were plenty of examples of projects that died because the era of supply chain tightness there. You just don't hear about it as much, right? People don't tell those stories. If you knew that that supply chain problem was going to arrive in 2017, you could take some educated guesses as to, hey, in which of these situations is the offtaker I plan to sell this electricity to going to basically be up against a wall and say, well, I'll pay whatever you need me to pay to make this project work because it's in my plans and I need it. You could take some educated guesses. And that's what we're doing right now, where you say, I think the probability of a price inelastic offtaker is higher here. I bet I'll get them to pay whatever it takes. But you don't know. They're just educated guesses, right? Because in a lot of these situations, if you do have a PPA, it's probably one that you got with a utility via a competitive RFP. And those are the parties that are probably going to take a long time to show their cards as far as what they're willing to do on price and if they have to rerun the RFP. In short, that comp is definitely relevant and it does inspire some optimism and steal one up to take a few chances. A lot of people lost a lot of money on projects that got hung up in that era too. That's true. There were many projects that were affected. There was, in some cases, a slowdown. So yeah, it's not a perfectly sanguine projection in that sense. Now, when you talk about the need for power looking forward, it's about the fact that there's going to be more data centers on the grid, more power needed because of AI. And like we've discussed, there's not a great alternative. So if all these projects are canceled, if this 18% or what have you of projects that were expected to be needed to meet demand all of a sudden are scrapped because of uncertainty, what's that going to mean? Is that going to mean that we're not going to have enough power on the grid? Is it going to mean that data centers are not built? Do you have any sense of how that's going to play out? I think it just means that fewer data centers are going to get built. I think it's as simple as that. Right now, it's complete chaos. The data centers are either trying to do behind-the-meter private use networks, one out of 50 of those work because you need a million things to go right, or you're trying to get your power from the grid where you sort of say, here's my power plan, but ultimately you're coming to a deal with the RTO about large new load interconnection. And right now, there's already tons of data centers that have put in that interconnection request. They stand ready to post their deposits. The utility likes the idea, or the RTO likes the idea of them coming online. But there's a huge queue on the load side, and the math doesn't work. There isn't enough power to meet all that new demand. It is already a huge problem, as anyone knows who is doing data centers. All that's going to happen now is the same phenomenon. It's just going to get more severe. The gate for new load will open up less than it is right now. That is to say, you already have a long line of aspiring data centers saying, I need to be new load on your grid. I'm a big new power player. Please facilitate delivery of electricity to me. You already have a huge line of those people with just a leak of them making it through as far as getting what they need to have power for their data center. That trickle is going to get even slower. Where the rubber hits the road is that data center build out is going to slow down at a time when everybody wants it to be accelerating. That's interesting. To conclude, David, as an investor yourself, how are you dealing with this uncertainty? Obviously, part of that is a lot of planning and a lot of research that you've been publishing, but how are you approaching this period? You have to take each decision on its own. We have separated all of our projects into essentially three different categories. One of them is this project is fine getting its ITC without changing our behavior decisions or actions in the near term. On the other extreme, there's a, okay, well, we obviously should kill this one because it's not going to place in service for six years. We probably have to put 20 million into it to get there. It's just too many unknowns. We've only put a couple hundred K into it. We just got to cut it. There's going to be a lot of those. Those are two categories. There's the stuff in the middle, which is the hard part where you say, this could end up fine, but you have to look at what do we have to put into it? How much risk are we exposed to? What's the reward if we're right? How long do we have to wait until we see the answer? We're basically going to triage that list. We're going to force rank them all based on those four questions. We're going to say, all right, this is the hard group. This is the 45 projects that are hard. Let's look at those four questions and force rank them in our mind. We're going to capitalize the top 40% of them or something like that. I don't know exactly how we're going to decide where that line is, but it's going to be something like that. Then you just have to do your best to get the safe harboring right, which is not looking like an easy task at the moment, and limit your exposure until the cards flip over that tell you if you're going to be all right in a non-ITC world. It's hard. We're figuring it out as we go. We've been in these spots before. The industry has had a lot of situations like this where things get really fuzzy as you gaze to the horizon. We're pretty good at this as a sector. I feel like I've been here before, but I don't like it. It's very uncomfortable, and it's impossible to get all these decisions right. We're going to have to be prepared to have a few losses that arise from procuring some transformers for projects that don't make it. That is simply going to happen. Accepting that is an important part of what's going on. We have to believe that scarcity will drive increased margins for the projects that do make it. The projects that we support, and we were right to do so, it's probably true that they will garner higher purchase prices when we sell them because the universe is thinning out. I believe that's true, and I believe that in the end, our fund's probably not going to do as well as I thought it was seven weeks ago, but I think it's still going to do fine because supply and demand will lead to the surviving projects being worth more in the end. And that's kind of what we're aiming for, and we're trying to manage the risk the best we can while we do that. Well, that's interesting. And obviously, a lot more we could talk about when it comes to the start of construction guidance, but I think we're running out of time here. But before we end, I imagine a lot of listeners would be interested in seeing some of this data. Where can they find it? I see it on LinkedIn. Is there a way that they can look at some of these charts and some of this analysis? A lot of it's fairly proprietary. I mean, the way that we sort of dig through different parts of the interconnection queue, assess the probability of a project making it, we put a lot into that. So putting our grand model out into the world is something we're probably not going to do, and sharing some of the main findings is kind of where we decided to land on that. But a lot of the data comes from scraping from public information in various queues. A lot of it came from Arrhenia, who we use to kind of do a lot of that aggregation of data and the filtering and framing of data. There is some LCOE models that are feeding into this a little bit. You know, Wood Mackenzie's NRELs, Arrhenia's LCOE models. I think somebody needs to be doing LCOE models that create a composite project of solar storage and wind that is dispatchable and deliverable in this combination, and understanding what it's going to take for that to be cost competitive with a natural gas plant. That sort of has been done. That's a smart way to look at it as far as thinking about how close we are to grid parity at different parts of the country without an ITC. So where could people go just to see kind of the headline numbers? Is that on your website, or is it someplace else? Yes, we have it on our website. It's www.segueinfra.com slash insights. That page is a repository of my bloviating and analysis that we're willing to share. And there's a lot in there, including this set of four research analysis that we put out related to these different bills, including the final one. So those are all in there. And you can get the headline numbers there and kind of some of the commentary around them. Great. Well, thank you. Certainly, I and I think the industry really appreciates that resource. And David, thank you for taking the time today. I think it's been a really interesting conversation. Obviously, there's still a lot of question marks, but I think that it's something that we're going to have to continue to follow. Thanks for having me. It was fun, Andrew, and this will be evolving every day. So by the time this comes out, I probably have a different view on it. I think everybody's going to have to adapt as they go. And thanks for creating a conversation around it. Well, thank you again. And thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

I'm Gabriela Valente, Infralogics Reporter in Brazil. Today we are going to discuss in Brazil's infrastructure landscape, focusing on the significant opportunities in the transportation segment. We are honored to have with us Gabriela Avelino, Undersecretary of Promotion and Planning at Brazil's Ministry of Transportation. Gabriela, thank you for joining us. Hello, Gabriela. Thank you so much for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. Brazil has announced a substantial pipeline of highway concessions. Could you walk us through the scale of these investments and what the government hopes to achieve with this new wave of projects until the end of President Lula's third term? Absolutely, Gabriela. Brazil is currently delivering the most ambitious roadway concession program in its history and one of the largest globally. Until the end of next year, we expect to have completed 44 highway concession auctions. Historically, Brazil was used to holding an average of 1.5 auctions per year. In President Lula's term, and thanks to our Minister Renan Filho's leadership, we will have raised this number to 11. This ambitious pipeline covers over 23,000 kilometers of federal highways and will mobilize more than $57 billion in private investment. To give you some perspective, that's double what was privately invested in federal highways in all of Brazil's history up until 2022. More important than numbers are our end goals. Brazil needs better infrastructure if we wish to grow and thrive as a country. Our roadway concession program is not just about building roads, it's about creating an efficient transport network which fosters economic and social development. So our main goals include improving logistics efficiency across Brazil's key economic corridors, also reducing transportation costs, especially for agribusiness exports, and finally enhancing road safety and reducing traffic fatality rates, which are a very serious social problem that we wish to correct. It's very interesting. Many of those projects require a significant upfront capital. How are the contracts being designed to support project finance structures and also to mitigate risk for investors, especially for the international investors that are not used to the Brazilian market? Okay, this is a key question and one that we took seriously from the beginning. The federal government has redesigned its concession models to include multiple regulatory innovations, mostly inspired by European and multilateral standards. Let me give you some examples. We have brand new risk-sharing mechanisms, so in the past, many important risks that could interfere with a roadway concession were not even mentioned in the contract. For example, extraordinary risks associated with climate change. Now, those risks are explicitly mentioned and allocated in the contract, so there's predictability. We even share demand risks when they surpass a certain bandwidth. More than just transparency, which is in itself an improvement, we are also sharing more risks than we used to, which is great for investors. Another example that I could give you is escrow accounts, which we implemented to mitigate risks associated with exchange rates and input prices, for example. So these are especially interesting for international investors. We also have a mechanism for automatic toll adjustments, which will mitigate cash flow risks due to bureaucratic obstacles. We also implemented dispute boards, which are designed to avoid litigation, which are costly, and they act on an ad hoc basis on technical matters, which will help contracts have a better flow throughout their implementation. And finally, Brazil has a special bond designed to help companies raise money for infrastructure investments. These bonds are called here incentivized debentures, and the buyer of those bonds is benefited with lower income taxes. So last year alone, there were over $3.5 billion raised using these incentivized debentures for highway concessions. And besides the new concessions, the federal government is also working on a new retender model to optimize the stressed contracts that had financial challenges in the past. The first one to be auctioned was the BR-163 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, a key corridor for agribusiness, right after we had the BR-101 in the state of Espírito Santo. What are the lessons that we can learn from the previous concession contracts and how this new model of optimizing contracts are different from the previous procedures for retendering contracts that we used to have in Brazil? The BR-163 corridor is indeed, as you said, vital for Brazilian agribusiness because it connects Mato Grosso, an important Brazilian state, with considerable production of soy, cattle, and other agricultural products to export routes that move billions in commodities annually. The first concession failed, in our view, due to inadequate risk modeling and unrealistic demand forecasts. And that experience has taught us very valuable lessons. The new retender model is built on transparency, investor confidence, and operational continuity. So some key improvements include a clean and efficient exit strategy for the incumbent operator without compromising service levels, a full disclosure of historical performance data, which reduces information asymmetry and levels the playing field for new bidders. We also have an improved financial model with demand assumptions based on audited data and robust risk sharing. And we also have a faster regulatory processing and legal clarity throughout the process. We worked very close to the government controller and auditor's office to give the private sector the security they need to keep investing in Brazil. So this approach ensures that stressed contracts do not become liabilities to the system. So instead, they get restructured with fairness and future-oriented principles. So in both cases, the BR-163 and the BR-101, the incumbent concessionaires were the only ones bidding for the new contracts in Mato Grosso do Sul. It was Motiva, which is the former CCR, and in Espírito Santo, Eco Rodovias. How does the Ministry of Transportation respond to the market concerns that market players might be hesitant to engage with these new contracts when there is also a robust pipeline of new concessions? What can be done to attract investors to each type of concession? To be honest, I believe we need to reframe the narrative around retendered assets like those two that you mentioned. There is no lack of market interest in this type of project. It's quite the opposite because assets such as BR-163, for example, are highly valuable. They are a mature, well-known highways with strong and consistent demand, a history of stable revenue, and established toll plazas that are familiar to users and operators alike. It's precisely because of their high quality that these were among the first assets to be auctioned decades ago. So the reason we saw so bitter in both cases is not a reflection of market hesitation regarding the asset itself, and nor is it a hesitation towards the optimization process, but rather of the scale and competitiveness of Brazil's current infrastructure pipeline. We are offering a large and diverse portfolio of roadway concessions, so it is only natural that firms will prioritize based on their own strategies and resource availability. Moreover, the retender process for BR-163 was fully revealed and validated by the Federal Courts of Accounts, ensuring a high level of institutional credibility and legal robustness. The contract underwent substantial improvements, incorporating modern governance practices, enhanced performance metrics, and mechanisms that align with international best practices. So rather than reinterpreting the single bid outcome as a hesitation, we see it as a sign that well-structured de-risked assets continue to attract qualified players, especially those that are already familiar with the corridor operations. These are excellent projects, and the government remains confident that retender concessions, when well-prepared, will continue to be strategic components of our national logistic plan. So as for your last question about what could be done to attract investors to all types of concessions we have on our pipeline, I believe we need to showcase the regulatory improvements that I mentioned earlier and let the market know all the work that we have been doing. Minister Renan Filho and Vice Minister Jorge Santoro have both been to Europe and the U.S. multiple times to talk to foreign investors and show them the quality of our legal and regulatory framework. For more than just talking, we need to listen. And these roadshows, we have collected feedbacks about our projects and improved them accordingly. So to sum up, I believe that the key is to communicate with the market as we have been doing. In both cases of the retender, the concessionaires were not able to fulfill the investment plans that were initially designed for those roads. Why is it important to allow Motiva or EcoRodovias to participate in the bidding process? Wouldn't this represent a disadvantage for other competitors? And doesn't this model provide some sort of comfort to investors who are unable to fulfill the contracts and make the required investments? So Motiva's participation followed strict legal and procedural rules, and the decision was grounded in ensuring continuity of services. As you already mentioned, they had returned the asset voluntarily under Brazil's formal contract return framework. So renegotiating was our way to solve the problem faster and ensure users get the quality of service that they need immediately. As I said, we worked alongside the government controller and our auditor's office throughout the whole process to make sure that it was all legally sound. And to make sure the process was transparent and competitive, Motiva had to submit a bid under the same conditions as any other player, and so did EcoRodovias. In fact, their re-entry signals market confidence in the restructured asset, and that's the message that we value. And finally, as for your last question, that we might be providing comfort to investors that are unable to fulfill contracts, I believe that we are providing structured relief and not a free pass. Our model balances investor comfort with public accountability, and we acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances can affect even the most carefully planned projects. And as I also mentioned, some contracts designed decades ago had some imperfections that we were able to correct now, and that we have a more matured regulatory framework. So the retender mechanism offers a clear, legal, and transparent way for the government to restructure the assets without litigation or loss of service. This predictability is good for investors. It sends a message that Brazil honors contracts, even when adjustments are needed, and that the rules are clear from entry to exit. That's very interesting. It's indeed a modern and new model. But shifting to another sector, on the rail front, Brazil also has ambitious plans for expanding its rail network. Could you walk us through the status of the main upcoming projects and why those projects are crucial for the Brazilian economy? Sure. We are moving forward with two major projects this year. The first one we call East-West Integration Railway, or FICU-FIOL in Portuguese, which connects Agua Boa in the grain-producing region of Mato Grosso to ports in the south of the state of Bahia, and interconnecting with the North-South Railway. The second one we call EF-118, which is a high-capacity corridor between Vitória and Rio de Janeiro, and focused on mineral exports and container transport, and enabling rail transport to the Azul port. So these two projects are crucial for three reasons, actually. The first one is that they lower logistic costs for Brazilian exports, especially grains and minerals. They shift freight from road to rail, which reduces carbon emissions, since rail emits up to 80% less carbon emissions per ton transported, and they also help diversify and decongest our logistic matrix. Some of the key rail projects in Brazil are linked to the mining activities, for example, and there are companies such as Vale and Rumo who are deeply engaged in that type of project. How can new investors be attracted to this segment, and how do you perceive the international interest in the Brazilian railways? We see growing interest from international infrastructure investors, including funds aligned with ESG strategies. International appetite is growing because Brazil offers scale, demand certainty, and a logistics deficit that translates into opportunity. To attract new players, we are changing risk sharing in rail contracts to provide safety for investors. And as I said before, we are promoting our projects in global roadshows, listening to what the market has to say and adjusting projects accordingly. Brazil has been discussing a high-speed train project for many years. How have those discussions advanced so far, and what are the expectations for developing a project of that type? The high-speed train agenda, particularly the Rio-São Paulo corridor, has been debated for decades. What's different now is that we are approaching the project with more realism, better governance, and stronger data. A private company is currently conducting updated feasibility and demand studies for this corridor that I mentioned, Rio-São Paulo, under a federal authorization and seeks to implement this line under private financing. We know that high-speed rail is capital intensive, but it is also a strategic project with transformative potential for Brazil's southeast region. The government is not directly involved in this project, but we have established a regulatory framework which we hope may enable it. We are also conducting a feasibility study for six passenger rail corridors across Brazil, which we hope to announce later this year. We are structuring this project around real estate development, and we hope to unlock new rail development opportunities under this new model. Those are very interesting projects, and it looks like the investors will have a lot to study. So, to conclude our conversation, what message would you send to the international investors who are watching Brazil closely, but may still be on the fence considering all the macroeconomic challenges and the geopolitical scenario across the globe? My message is, Brazil is no longer a potential, it's a concrete, investable reality. We have built a pipeline that is technically robust, financially sound, environmentally responsible, and legally secure. Our institutional framework is maturing, our governance is transparent, and our contracts reflect best global standards. We understand investors' concerns, but we also know that long-term value lies where demand is real, regulation is stable, and public policy aligns with private capital, and that is what Brazil is offering today. Now is the time to take part in this transformation. Brazil is open, committed, and prepared for the next generation of infrastructure. Gabriela, thank you very much for your insights today.

I'm Tanu Pandey, a part of InfraLogic's editorial team in London, and I'll be your host for the podcast today. We are recording this podcast at a time when the world is going through a major transition with the growing need for infrastructure and large focus on energy transition. A major portion of global investments needed in infrastructure are right now in the emerging markets, with an annual need for US$920 billion for long-term investors. Having said that, the emerging markets in Asia are said to be the fastest growing one. To discuss this, we have someone from one of the most active investors in the emerging markets in infrastructure, Actis, which has raised US$26 billion so far. Last October, Actis joined forces with General Atlantic and as a global investment platform now has US$108 billion combined as assets under management. We have with us Adrian McAuliffe, a partner at Actis and the head of its Long Life Infrastructure Fund, which recently closed its second fund at US$1.7 billion. Adrian has led the fund's early transactions in emerging markets such as Chile, Brazil, India, and the Middle East and Africa. Before that, he worked within Actis' energy sector team. Welcome, Adrian, and thanks for taking out time for this edition of InfoLogic Podcast. Jumping right into the conversation, the first question here, why does Actis focus on growth markets and sustainable infrastructure investments? Why take this approach? Thank you, Tanu. It's a real pleasure to be here. Thank you for the opportunity to talk about our passion of investing in critical infrastructure. You say in emerging markets, what we like to refer to as the world's growth markets, or otherwise we like to say most of the world. Sometimes people have referred to these markets as the rest of the world, but we like to remind everyone that actually these are the markets where about 85% of the world's population lives in many of the world's highest, fastest growing economies, and actually just some of the world's largest economies. We believe that in the infrastructure space, there is just a really interesting supply demand equation in our markets where historically, and even today, the majority of capital, the significant majority of capital is raised for and invested in the developed markets, whereas we believe the majority actually of infrastructure opportunity is in our markets. We think investing in markets where we see over two thirds of the investment opportunity, whereas over two thirds of the capital is raised in the space for North America, Western Europe, Australia, and there's just a massive opportunity to invest into infrastructure in these markets. These are markets that are rapidly growing and that all have a need for fundamental, critical, long-term infrastructure. We'll talk about some of those themes, I'm sure, today, whether it's renewable energy, whether it's growing and reinforcing the electricity grids. A big part of what we do is in the electricity sector, as you mentioned, but we also invest into transport infrastructure, such as roads, and we invest heavily into the digital infrastructure revolution, including data centers, towers, and fiber. Across all of our markets, there's a massive need for investment in those areas. One example, when we talk about renewable energy, which is probably the largest single category for investment, there is more renewable energy being built, more renewable energy plants being built in our markets every year than in developed markets. Yet, the vast majority of the capital chases opportunities in those markets. So we think the natural result of that supply, demand, and balance is really interesting risk-adjusted returns for investors who have the deep experience to operate effectively in our markets. Very interesting, valid point on calling it a growth market rather than emerging markets. However, on a follow-up question, emerging markets have gone through a transformation, particularly in energy and other infrastructure sectors over the past few years. How has Actis seen the markets evolve, and how has it altered or improved its strategy to accommodate all these shifts? Thanks. It's a big question. First, I would say in the term emerging markets or growth markets, we think it's quite antiquated. There are over 100 countries that are often bucketed into that category of emerging markets. Some of those countries couldn't be more different. If you're looking at countries like India, which is just one of the world's largest economies and has been growing at 5%, 6%, 7% per year, or other big middle-income countries we invest in like Brazil or Mexico, are very different than markets in Southeast Asia or markets in Sub-Saharan Africa or markets in Eastern Europe. All of the markets offer investment opportunities, but we think that there are more sophisticated ways to think about markets than just bucketing them as developed markets or emerging markets. I think that's the... I know we'll talk about the perception of risk in our markets. The markets are often painted with one brush, and we just think that that's not a sophisticated way to invest. Some of the markets where we invest have very mature regulatory frameworks, so to get to the heart of your question. Investing in some of our markets 30 years ago would have been a very different environment, but when we're investing in the large target markets such as India or Brazil, or investing in renewable energy or toll roads or electricity transmission, these are very well-worn sectors where billions and billions and billions of dollars of private capital, both foreign capital and domestic capital, have been raised to successfully invest into these sectors. I think often investors don't actually realize how mature and stabilized the regulatory environment has become in those markets. There are very transparent auctions that take place regularly, every few months in some of the larger markets. As an investor, you can diligence 15 or 20 or 30 years of track record, so it's not that we're... Sometimes I feel that we receive questions where investors are worried that we're sort of taking a bet on these markets, and I say, no, it's not a bet. We're looking at 20 years of track record. Let's look at the last 20 years. Let's look at have the off-takers paid their bills? Has the regulation been stable? If there have been any disputes, how have they been resolved? Have the courts or the industry bodies or regulatory bodies favorably resolved and fairly resolved any kind of disputes that do arise? I can tell you in the major markets where we invest, the track record is excellent. If you're investing in the right assets with the right off-taker and the right contractual protections, I think that's been the biggest change is the maturity of regulation. And again, I wouldn't make that claim for all emerging markets. I also wouldn't make that claim for all developed markets, but I think that we invite investors to work with firms like ours to look at the markets that have that maturity of regulation. The second thing I would say is that because of that maturity and the expansion of the opportunity, it's opened up new kinds of investment opportunities, right? For the last 25 years, we have been investing in power generation. You mentioned that I used to be in our energy sector team. In that fund, we have been building, buying and operating power generation assets for the last 25 years across all of the main growth markets. That opportunity continues. We say not only do we need to build enough power plants to basically double the world's energy generation in the next 20 or 30 years, we also need to replace most of the existing power generation with renewable energy. It's almost like building two new planets full of power plants and much of that growth is happening in our market. So that opportunity persists. However, now there's also an opportunity to invest in long-term contracted stabilized assets. And that's the strategy that I lead within the firm, what we call the Actis Long Life Infrastructure Strategy, where now there are hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term contracted infrastructure assets across those sectors that I refer to, where one can invest and improve the assets and generate cash yield and deploy a more traditional of core infrastructure strategy. And I would say that that strategy probably wouldn't have been available 20 or 30 years ago when private infrastructure in these markets was newer. The other obvious new explosive vector is the digital infrastructure space. So with the same dynamics that investors see in the US and Europe, whether it's data centers, carve-outs of towers and fiber businesses and creating infrastructure assets out of that critical digital infrastructure, all of those same trends are happening in our markets. We think almost a once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in the energy space, but also the digital space alongside other traditional infrastructure sectors. And I think that that boom is happening right now across Asia, across Latin America, across parts of Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa. Just taking a little bit more on, you mentioned painting all markets, growth markets with the same brush. A lot of times some might consider the emerging markets risky, but you have pushed back on that idea saying growth markets are not risky. And why is this? How does Actus sort of mitigate against these risks in these markets? And what is your answer to those who consider or claim that they would probably stay away from these markets because they're risky? Thank you for the question and the opportunity to comment on this. I think this is the topic which I spend the most time discussing with our investors and stakeholders. And again, when we think of most of the world, exactly as you said, we should not paint all growth markets with the same brush. And, you know, we've developed our own tool that we call the Actus Atlas and say, instead of just labeling markets as developed or emerging, we think about global champions. We think about large middle income countries. We think about small stable countries. And then we think about more fragile economies, right? There are many different types of economies, you know, some that are more focused on resource extraction and export, some that are more built into global supply chains and sort of export based economies of non-resource. So there are many different kinds of economies. And again, we're probably focused on 15 or so countries that have the large replicable infrastructure programs with a great track record of private participation. Now, so I would not make the claim that investing generally in all emerging markets is low risk. That's not the case. You know, I think that actually a lot of investors have the experience that they've invested in other types of products. They may be invested in the stock market in our markets and have had mixed experiences. But infrastructure is a special category in the sense that in order to attract the capital needed for this true critical infrastructure, which is really the backbone of economic growth in many countries, many of our markets really do rely on foreign capital, whether it's foreign equity capital and even in many cases, foreign debt capital to fund their infrastructure programs. And in order to attract that capital, they offer many kinds of risk protections that wouldn't be available in other categories of investing. So for example, even just having really long term contracts with essentially fixed prices, you know, often inflation index revenues, an asset where you basically know what your revenue will be for the next 25 or 30 years, you know, is very different than other types of investing. So, and I would say some of those really long term contracts are becoming less available in the developed markets, but it's still the norm in most of our markets. So the starting point is real long term contracted infrastructure, real critical infrastructure. When we're doing renewable energy and generally investing in wind and solar plants in most of our markets, these are literally the lowest cost power available, right? So this is power that the country needs in growing economies. And we would say, you know, investing in a critical service, which is really needed by the government and by the population and by the users and providing a low cost way to provide that service, that's the best risk mitigation that you can have. Beyond all that, then are really specific contractual protections that are usually offered to infrastructure investors, which again are not typically available for many other kinds of investing. You know, some combination of government guarantees behind your projects, as I said, inflation indexation of your revenues, you know, is a big topic in global investing and that is the norm in many categories of infrastructure in our markets. Many markets actually offer US dollar linked contracts. So no currency risk is a risk that any global investors have to manage. Many emerging markets or growth markets actually offer US dollar linked contracts to attract that capital. In some of our assets, we also have political risk insurance from the likes of the World Bank, you know, MIGA program or other political risk insurance providers. There may be other downside protections in your contract, like in for investing in roads. Sometimes there are minimum traffic guarantees and many of our assets have what we call availability based contracts, right, where you're not actually even taking volume risk. So when you break that down and you look at, you know, are you taking pricing risk? Are you taking volume risk? Do you have a long-term contract? Are you taking currency risk? Are you taking inflation risk? Are you taking interest rate risk? Do you have government guarantees or other off-taker, you know, credit enhancement? Often the answer is yes. So now if you package all of that together, I would say you can make very risky investments in most markets, but you definitely can find long-term contracted, well-mitigated, lower risk infrastructure assets in our markets. And I would say the same thing about Europe or the US. There are many investments that are portrayed as infrastructure where you're taking many kinds of risk, growth risk and pricing risk and volume risk. So it really depends on the nature of the investment. And in our markets, it's a very large opportunity to invest in true long-term contracted critical infrastructure with those contractual protections. There's a wide range of types of investments, but in the infrastructure space, it's a really attractive risk-adjusted return opportunity. Right. And moving on, long life infrastructure fund, the hat that you wear, it's a strategy that invests in power as well as other infrastructure assets, roads, digital infrastructure. It's a sort of all-in-one kind of thing for long-term infrastructure where there are not many of such funds. And what is the focus there? And if you could take us through some basic ideas behind the strategy, and we know that you are there and you were from the beginning of this strategy, you were the mind behind it. What is the focus there? Thank you. Yes. So the long life infrastructure strategy we developed to capture this opportunity to be a long-term owner of assets in our markets. And many of the companies that construct these assets, actually, their business model is not to be long-term operators and owners, right? If we're buying from a developer or from a construction company or from a local family conglomerate, you know, they actually often, it's not their business model to be the long-term owner. So investors do need long-term, responsible, experienced operational owners. And so we developed this strategy to acquire those kinds of long-term contracted operating infrastructure assets as we've been discussing. You mentioned we do invest across sectors and, you know, that's deliberate to provide real diversification to our investors, right? Diversification by region, by currency, by sector, by type of asset. So in a fund, you know, we may have, you know, dozens of individual assets, you know, managed within a number of portfolio companies to provide that kind of real global diversification. But fundamentally we are investing in long-term contracted operating assets, you know, with many layers of downside protection. We're focused on delivering a very substantial portion of the return through annual cash yields or dividends. And we think in many ways it's a return to the infrastructure sector when it was first developed as an asset class, I would say it's actually what many investors were seeking when they're thinking about infrastructure investing. They were thinking about assets that are real hard assets providing critical services to the population that have long-term contracts, that have regular, fairly reliable cash flows and cash yields on an annual basis. They were thinking about assets where the returns are not correlated to the stock market and to other asset classes. You know, that was the power of infrastructure in a portfolio, you know, not really, it's very, very defensive sector and not really linked to economic cycles in the same way. As some of the industry has sort of become more similar to other kinds of investing, sort of looking at, you know, high growth investments and, you know, depending the entirety of the return on capital gain. And we think that actually this kind of investing is what many investors want in their portfolio. I think we're providing an interesting option to have true diversification in these investments that are really uncorrelated and that are really diversified and that fundamentally provide that type of long-term contracted, regular cash yielding profile. So that's why we developed the strategy and I think that, you know, there's been great interest. And I think especially in the last few months, you know, I think investors have especially focused on looking for opportunities to truly diversify because many investors are overweight in certain developed markets. Right. And in the energy sector particularly, what are the focus segments currently for actors? Are the geopolitical and economic policies in various markets leading to a renewed focus on some newer or more non-traditional sectors? In our target markets, I would say one of the benefits is that, you know, we don't need to look for speculative or, you know, very new technologies. You know, we are investing primarily in really tried and tested technologies. Of course, within those categories, there are always advances about how to become more efficient and provide the same service at a lower cost. But fundamentally, we're doing wind power generation, solar power generation, sometimes gas fire generation, where that's part of the local energy transition. But beyond power generation, the other real backbone of the system is the grid, the transmission grid and the electricity distribution grid. And we say you can't have energy transition without transmission. In renewable energy in particular, often the areas that have the great wind speeds or the great solar radiation, you know, maybe in the mountains or in the desert or like actually quite far from the population center. So the need for electricity transmission to bring that renewable energy from those areas to the cities is just as important as building the power generation. So we're invested heavily into electricity transmission in places like Brazil that have those kinds of characteristics. And then if you look at electricity distribution, which is then taking the electricity from the grid and really, you know, powering people's homes and businesses, again, the more there is intermittent renewable energy on the system, you know, you need a lot of investments into the grid to be able to manage the complexities of the electricity system. So we invest across those very traditional backbone electricity subsectors. Beyond that, one interesting sector we've looked at in the energy space is what we call district energy. So in particular, in the Middle East, which is the world leader in district cooling, I'm based in Singapore. There's also a lot of district cooling here in Singapore. This is the kind of technology that we like because it's providing true critical infrastructure Fundamentally, district cooling is a technology where you can provide air conditioning, basically cooling, in a centralized way, you know, from centralized plants and then distributing cooling through pipes throughout a community. Rather than every building having its own air conditioner, it's basically done centrally and then piped. And by doing it that way, typically you can use about half as much energy to generate that cooling compared to every building having its own air conditioning system. So a tremendous sustainability story, a tremendous savings in energy. And the main focus after investing in this business is how to become even more efficient in the use of energy, becoming more efficient in the use of water, using recycled water rather than fresh water. So in areas where water is scarce, obviously that's also a big issue for cooling. So that's an example of using energy in a different way to provide other critical infrastructure. But, you know, we're not investing ourselves in speculative technologies, I would say. Just a little follow up question on this district cooling. Do you think it would be an easy transition, maybe in the short term, because consumers would need to take to it? Is there a big market? You mentioned the Middle East, but elsewhere in the growth markets, do you see there is a market for this kind of opportunity? It is a rapidly growing market globally. The Middle Eastern region is the world leader in that and roll out of that technology, and it is the preferred mode of cooling and air conditioning in many parts of that region in the Gulf. We do have district cooling, as I said, here in Singapore and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a very advanced and efficient way to cool buildings. The real estate developers or government agencies do need to be quite forward looking and organized to implement those kinds of systems, because it is normally better to implement the systems when you are rolling out new real estate developments. You can also retrofit older buildings, but I think the most efficient way to do it is to have it as a part of the urban planning. Because there's been such growth in cities and urban planning in the Middle East and because the temperatures are so high and cooling is such a 24-7 fundamental requirement, I think it's natural that those markets have been the leaders. We know that India is looking a lot more at district cooling and some of our biggest markets. I do think it's definitely a growth sector across warm places. In terms of geographies for the markets that you cover, are there any particular countries or markets which you're more bullish on or which are less riskier that you consider if you had to choose top five, maybe? Which ones would it be? Generally in infrastructure, thinking about the markets that we're focused on, I don't want to characterize that the country or market in general is less risky, but I would say that in these markets, as I've been saying, that have these very well-established regulatory regimes, there are low-risk opportunities available. There are also high-risk, high-growth opportunities available, which can also be exciting for other kinds of investment strategies. But if you're looking for long-term contracted core infrastructure, the natural places to look are the really large markets that have well-established, repeatable infrastructure programs. India and Brazil are our two largest single markets that we've invested in since we've launched this strategy. But many of the markets of Latin America fit that description. Most markets, most of the large countries in Latin America, substantially privatized their infrastructure programs as far back as the 1990s with a lot of World Bank support. So again, there's 20 or 30 years of track record in most of the infrastructure categories. In Asia, besides India, Southeast Asia is a very vibrant region. As a firm, we have activities in most of the major markets of Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia has very large economies. The Philippines, as an example, is a country where there has been very, very substantial ownership of infrastructure by private firms. They've been welcoming more than ever foreign investors alongside the domestic private capital to meet their infrastructure ambitions. I could tell you a similar story about most of the countries of Southeast Asia. So this is a natural area of growth for us. As a firm, over half of our capital is invested into Asia. Sometimes people say Asia is the future. I would say Asia is the present. Asia is already close to 40% of the world's GDP, depending on how you measure it. Sometime soon it'll be half the world's GDP. So I think investors who have no exposure in their real assets program to Asia are missing an opportunity. This is a huge part of the world's growth and will be for many, many years to come. We're also very excited about what's happening in parts of Eastern Europe, where the energy transition in particular is a very important part of government policy, where most of the power there is really classic, traditional thermal energy, and there's a real need to supplement and replace that over time with renewable energy. We're investing more than ever in the Middle East. So I gave the example, we're invested in the district cooling company in Dubai, but we're also doing renewable energy. And I think many other investors have seen that opportunity. We've seen some competitors also opening offices in the region. So I think the MENA region is providing more investment opportunity than ever, often partnering with local firms and institutions who are looking for foreign capital and expertise to work alongside them. Very interesting. Switching gears a little bit here, coming towards the end of our conversation. Last year, General Atlantic, the transaction happened and you became this large entity. Has that acquisition somehow impacted your fundraising or strategy? And how does Actis view this sort of merger in terms of consolidation of themes or strategies? The merger is very exciting for Actis, being part of a bigger group like General Atlantic, one of the world's preeminent, most respected asset management firms that's been a real leader in growth equity, obviously is exciting for us and our teams. And we know they've also had a lot of conviction in the growth markets for a long time. They've invested very significantly across Asia and across Latin America alongside their investment in the U.S. and Europe for decades, actually. So it's been a very natural fit. Actis is the real assets business within General Atlantic. So in some sense, from a day-to-day investment perspective, it's been business as usual. But we think that from a longer term perspective, we hear very often from our capital partners, from our investors, that they appreciate working with large multi-product firms where we can really offer solutions. You know, LPs at different times have different needs where they may be looking for more growth, more capital gain. They're interested in private equity. They're interested in infrastructure. They're interested in credit and being part of a larger group with more products to offer and really being a solutions provider and a partner. We call it capital partnering because we want to be partners with the investors to help meet their needs and they help us meet our investment ambitions. So I think for us, it's been a very natural and exciting partnership and can lead to a lot of growth where we can invest even more into these tremendous infrastructure opportunities that we see. Now, you asked about where there are maybe overlaps or synergies. I think the obvious place for us is in the digital space. So whereas Actus is focused on the infrastructure side of technology and digital, providing the backbone infrastructure and data centers and towers and fiber, and General Atlantic for a long time has been, for decades, has been a leader in technology investing. They are close to and invested in and know the ecosystem of many of the world's leading technology companies that require the data center capacity, the infrastructure that we can build and operate, or the technology companies that use those services. So I think there's a really natural synergy given their focus on technology and our very much increasing focus on digital infrastructure. Right. And is there anything that you would like to add, maybe one key point or your views on where the emerging market is going, the large investment opportunity that is there in the infrastructure space? And what are we going to see, maybe the key themes that we're going to see this year and next, sort of in the short term? I believe that diversification has been a real theme for investors recently. And I believe that more investors than ever are seeing the opportunity in our markets. You know, we've seen many global competitors start to open offices in some of our markets and we welcome that. We welcome, sometimes we get asked about competition. We welcome that competition because it will make it more mainstream, as it should be, to invest in Asia, you know, in some of our core markets. So we see that there is more interest than ever to invest into this opportunity of infrastructure in the growth markets, both to continue to build assets, to build power plants, build data centers. You know, the greenfield opportunity is tremendous. And as I've been talking about, we also think that the opportunity to buy great, high quality operating assets and then improve them is tremendous. And maybe that's one theme we didn't talk about as much, but it's not, we're not a passive financial investor. We are very much an active, usually control type of investor where we want to use real global best practices and capabilities to take what are already great assets, but make them even greater in every way and apply global best practices to provide, you know, even lower costs, more efficient, higher quality, you know, safer infrastructure assets in our markets. And I think that combination of being on the ground, doing this for decades, you know, being deeply, deeply integrated into those local ecosystems, as well as being deeply integrated and ingrained into the global infrastructure ecosystems. I think that's really the key to success in investing in the sector. Well, that was a very interesting and insightful conversation, particularly your points on the rapid growth in the emerging slash growth markets, the maturity that it is showing right now and the opportunities in some of the sectors like district cooling in the Middle East. And not to forget, Asia is not the future, but the present. Like you mentioned, thank you very much for this lovely discussion and also your great insights into the emerging markets and the infrastructure sector, Adrian. And we hope to see you again for another equally interesting and insightful chat very soon. It's been my pleasure.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, senior editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. And thank you for tuning in today. Joining us on this podcast is Nick Sangermano, president of GS Power Partners, a distributed generation IPP. Nick, thank you for coming on to the podcast. Mr. Vitelli, thank you for having me, Andrew. It's great to be on this. Of course. Now, before we get started, Nick, can you tell us a little bit about GS Power Partners? Pleasure, Andrew. GS Power Partners is a distributed generation IPP primarily focused on solar. We were founded about seven years ago, a little over two years ago. We were acquired by Diff Infrastructure, CDC Diff now. So we are a U.S. DG focused company developing and operating primarily in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. And when you say distributed generation, can you help define that for some of the listeners who might not be familiar with this term? I didn't know you were going to start with such a tough question, Andrew. This is one of the ones in our industry that comes off been recurring for a decade. How do you define DG? We define it as, or at least our target is somewhere in the five megawatt range, give or take. And that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. We are sub 10 megs, although we do occasionally target a little larger, but mostly it's state programs and bilaterals that allow you to avoid kind of the 20 megawatt threshold. For example, our focus is primarily in community solar, although we do some rooftop kind of CNI work as well and some direct bilaterals, but it's in that five megawatt range is kind of our sweet spot, I think. And I think that would be the kind of common DG response, I think, for a number of our peers and our group competitors would be kind of in that same league too. I think that's where solar is shaking out in the industry these days. So of course, defining the exact threshold of DG versus utility scale, it's a little bit of an art, but conceptually what DG means is instead of having small amount of very big projects concentrated in one location, you're having a greater number of smaller to maybe medium-sized projects that are spread throughout an area. Is that a fair summary? Yeah, I think you nailed it. That's right. Our approach, for example, to the extent we can is sort of take a virtual utility scale approach. We try to aggregate and grow our footprint in a specific region or state market, let's say, and manage it as you would a utility scale project, but across many different locations within some radius. That's sort of ideal, I think, in DG if you're going to run and operate assets long-term because utility scale has a number of advantages. Nothing's perfect. There's strengths and weaknesses of everything, but in the case of utility scale, you do have that ability to have people deployed on-site often with a certain level of economies of scale and kind of all the benefits you get with that. So with DG, we try to do something similar, but at the end of the day, we do run relatively small projects that are sprinkled across whatever market that you might be operating in, and there's pros and cons to that. We love it. We think it has a lot of great advantages, but there's a place for all the above here. Well, it's interesting. There are, as you've said, a lot of kind of pros and cons to both utility scale and DG, and it's been interesting over the last few years to see how that's shifted. I think a lot of aspects of DG that in the past were maybe not seen as so favorable, but now the needle has moved more towards DG than utility scale in the eyes of many in the industry, and I do want to get back to that later. But first, Nick, is your background in DG, or did you come from a different part of the sector? Well, I began my career in power at Enron, so it gives you a sense of how long ago that was. 25 years ago in 2000, I accepted a position there, and Enron for its strengths and weaknesses at the time was quite innovative, and they introduced me to this crazy idea of solar power and had identified a new opportunity in the space, solar and wind. And at that time, it was really utility scale was really the push where an impact could be made. And I think that carried through for much of the last 25 years, and probably you're right until the last few anyways, there's been sort of a strong bias, and rightly so towards utility scale. For myself personally, I've always been interested, I've often been a contrarian and have focused on smaller scale, not necessarily resi, but certainly CNI and DG. My career, my previous roles, executive roles, and then prior to that, I was a long time, as some people may know, I was a long time advisor, banker, and often cover DG and work with distributed generation companies, mostly in solar, which was at the time pretty small vertical. And I think there was always a latent demand or kind of a question mark as to when sort of DG would break out. And I think that's happened over the last four or five years for a number of reasons. Absolutely. And when you, just to make sure we're defining these terms for some listeners, when you say resi, obviously you mean residential solar, CNI, commercial and industrial, is that fitting somewhere between residential and utility scale? Yeah, I guess the way I would think about it is residential, I think self-explanatory. Commercial and industrial, you're working with generally bilaterally, usually on site of a location directly with a small factory or a larger commercial player, like a warehouse, for example. And we see this quite a bit in the Northeast where we're based in places like New Jersey and other, kind of in suburbs and so on, it's quite common. And then moving out towards kind of broader distributed generation, which would be us, kind of generally ground mounted systems. And then eventually upwards into larger scale being utility scale, yeah, that's a good definition of it. All right, great. Well, thank you for that. Now, I do want to get more into the differences between utility scale and DG, why DG is popular, how a lot of these factors interact. But before we do so, it's important to kind of set the table when it comes to policy, because that's one of the major driving forces here. We are recording this conversation on July 2nd, the day after the US Senate passed its version of what's been called the One Big Beautiful Bill. I'm actually not even sure if it still officially has that name, but it's basically the overhaul of, among other things, the energy incentive system. By the time you're listening to this, it might be a different version, but I think the general outline is known and it's going to really cut a lot of the incentives for renewable technologies. It's going to have a shorter wind down period. Nick, how is this affecting, let's start with overall the renewable energy industry. How are things going to be different, assuming there aren't huge surprises when this bill is eventually signed into law? Yeah, look, Andrew, I appreciate you bringing it up early. I think it's an important topic. And yes, this is July 2nd and nothing's final and kind of to some extent, nobody knows anything still at this point. But I think there are, as you rightly said, a couple of themes I think that are worth covering. Look, there's people a lot smarter in my organization and your audience who know policy and understand these nuances a lot better than I do. So rather than speak to some specific, I do think it's worth covering maybe a couple of bigger topics and kind of some themes, right? So I guess I would say that being in the industry for as long as I have been, really since the inception, and there's a number of people in the business who are like me, we've seen a lot of ups and downs, a lot of speed bumps and so on. And something that I've heard a lot is this industry has been through this before and has suffered through adversity and has always come out stronger. I think there's elements of that that are true, but I think this time that sentiment is, and this may be a little unpopular, but let me say it anyways, Andrew, you're someone who likes to hear it straight. So I think that sentiment is quite wrong this time. I do believe this time is different. It's different for a couple of reasons, and I think those reasons are germane, are really relevant to our discussion today. Look, was it Twain? History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And so I do think this is a rhyme. There are elements of this that look like the past, where we had the ITC retroactively adjusted. What was that? 10 years ago. We had safe harboring in the first Trump administration, but I think this time is different. I attended a conference where we had a private meeting with Rick Perry at the time, and I think that was in 2017 or 2018 when he was Secretary of Energy. And he began saying, look, I might be unpopular with some of you renewables people in the audience today, but I'm a power person. And in Texas, Governor's Texas, there's never been a politician in the history of politicians who's done more renewables than I have. And at the end of the day, I'm commercial, and if renewables make sense, then I'm all about it, regardless of executive policy. And I think he was sincere. And I think this time it's significantly different. The stakes are bigger, the actions are harsher. And while there may be some fundamental rationale that's maybe not even so extreme, what I've heard is terminology around these events as our industry being, and these are quotes that I saw in mainstream media, nothing as prominent as Infrologix, but smaller guys like New York Times and Wall Street Journal, with things like the industry is targeted for extinction, something I read yesterday, that the executive branch is giving this industry a kill shot. Sandhya from EDPR, I think was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as this industry was ambushed. I don't know if there's real consensus at the grassroots level. Our industry generally, I think has been, to a large extent, increasingly bipartisan. I think you saw that even in the IRA and other areas. Again, I'm not a policy expert, but I thought that's where the industry was heading. I think a lot of us did. And at the end of the day, we produce a valuable input to the economy, a differentiator, something that's really important. But I think the things you're seeing here have not been encountered where a government is taking action against an industry so deliberately and so wantonly without really commercial rationale maybe since the tobacco industry. And maybe it wasn't even that harsh on the tobacco industry by comparison. I think when challenges have come to the industry before, people have offered certain rationale, which maybe it's true that this industry could use some rolling off of incentives, that there's probably merit to that. I think we've heard that story in the past before. I think maybe it could be understood, perhaps even respected, that point of view. None of that's really been offered here. So I think the attack is stronger than it's been in the past. That's one area I think that we should be considering. The other is something we've thought a lot about here and other colleagues of mine across the industry is, secondly, in my opinion, the industry is ready for this. We're just at a different scale than ever before. We're at a different prominence. I think you're looking at this potentially as an acceleration to maturity. I think you have to look at these situations and you have to think, how do I manufacture positive outcomes from situations like this through this kind of adversity? And I think nothing brings people together like a level of adversity like this. I will say that I think, especially in the last years of the IRA, the IRA was built to do a lot of really good things in this business and make America stronger, make America more competitive. It perhaps was a smidge too generous in some respects. I think profit tends to fill the container it's put in. I think that when you look at the facts of Europe and some other areas, if you look at the facts of profit margins in this industry, I think there is room for improvement. I think that this should lead to a change in mindset of people in our industry. And I'm not talking about just DG or even solar renewables in general, but I think it's particularly effective in DG and solar. This is a moment for self-reflection. How can we become more like a power company? How can we evolve and mature into some of the sort of great organizations that are out there that have been doing power for a long time that they themselves grew quickly and eventually matured? I think about companies, let's say like Atanaska, for example, it's been around 25, 30 years, one of the largest private companies in America, not just power companies, but companies in general and many like it. And so lots of other issues around consolidation and other things, but I think this is an opportunity for us to really evolve to the next level. Well, it's interesting that you say that this is targeting the industry for extinction, that it's like a kill shot. Obviously been having a lot of conversations about this, including my last podcast, I had Julian Dumoulin Smith of Jeffries on. And it seems like a something of a consensus is people need the power. The United States needs this power and there's just not a real immediate alternative to renewables. So the impact is going to be less, this stuff doesn't get built and more, there are higher prices, higher costs that are then passed on to consumers. I mean, where do you fall on that? Because I've also heard others say that that view is excessively pollyannish and that really with these new economics, half the renewables that's been proposed, that's in the pipeline just simply won't pencil out. I don't know what that means. Does it mean that there's going to be an accelerated development of other technologies? Does it mean we're going to have to scale back power usage? But where do you fall? Do you think that this is going to really slow down renewables development or just make it more expensive and then those costs will be passed on? Well, first of all, Julian is a terrific professional and if he's saying these things, people should listen. A well-respected equity researcher and compliments for you for that discussion. Look, Andrew, it's both. You'd like to believe in a capitalist and free market situation like this, that the system is so efficient, prices are going to rise and everything's going to kind of work out except for the consumer. I think there's going to be a lot of dislocation. I think if you look at the projections and stats, and we've certainly looked at a number of sources, the various projections you see from organizations like SIA or Bloomberg NEF and some others, prominent guide houses, so on, you'll see that there's going to be some disruption. There's going to be some acceleration in order to meet some of the tests that the government's going to be imposing here, whatever they end up resulting in the final law that's signed. And you're going to see some falling off. There's going to be winners and losers. Some of it may be arbitrary, candidly. I think those who have some exposure on things like cost, maybe you don't have the scale, some other factors here could be fairly or unfairly, probably more the latter, be put into really tough positions. I think at the end of the day, though, what I've heard consistently from people even outside the power industry, consumers, industrial consumers, even people, personal consumers of power is power is just something that's really changed here. Here in uncharted territory, even for myself, 25 years in the power business, I have never worked in a rising power demand environment before. It's on a real basis. It's been declining. I think we're talking about a 1% compounded growth over the last 25 years. I think going forward, modest projections are 3%. That is a profound change in the way America and the economy runs. Powers really become not cost commodity to be managed out, which is often what we've seen over the last 20 years or something where that cost has just passed on, but it's been a strategic differentiator. It's a competitive advantage. If you have access to affordable, clean, generally clean power, you have an edge in your industry. It's not just AI. It's a lot of other areas of the economy as well. That's not going to change. Those companies are going to seek power. If there is all the trends, which we think are only going to accelerate over the next five years, net decline in supply and net increase in demand, companies with the ability to pay and pass that off to the consumer, well, the consumer is going to suffer. This isn't me. I'm no genius to be able to say I've uncovered this. I'm simply reiterating what is widespread, I believe, in terms of the market sentiment. I'll tell you from our perspective and from me and my colleagues here at GS Power, in a rare event, we have not yet found a contrarian view to this. No matter how hard we look, we have not found a dissenting view who's spoken negatively or countered any of these views for us, no matter how hard we've tried. We think these things are just inevitably going to happen. I think the more you push down renewables, in particular solar, and there will be that blip, that blip could be for months or years, unclear. I think you're going to see these impacts suffer. We've heard even just anecdotally, people say that rising power prices in the order of 10% per year or higher, double digit increases, which I think is going to be interesting to see the outcome of that. Will it eventually shake out? Power prices are going to lead to more lucrative or more viable solar projects and wind even without any kind of incentives. Maybe that's a good thing. I think the issue really is time, Andrew, like a lot of things. I think you can pace these changes, everyone wins. I think if you implement cliffs and you come up with sort of harsh measures, there's consequences. Adam, so you talk about this uncertainty, and obviously the details are still being made clear. But since at least last November, people have known that there's going to be a period of political uncertainty. And I think that brings us to the DG story, because it seems like in the first half of 2025, DG has really become one of the main areas we've been covering. We've seen at least a dozen, if not dozens of DG firms that are coming out and seeking capital, seeking growth. And when I talk to people in the industry, I think part of the reason is that there's a feeling that investors are seeing more attractiveness in DG in part because of, A, these political challenges and political headwinds, and some of the other challenges that the industry is seeing. I think that part of that is, of course, the fact that DG is quicker to build and develop than a utility-scale project, and that insulates it a little bit from some of the threats of price increases, both in terms of incentives and in terms of tariffs, which has been the other policy risk, and just, in general, increasing costs. But Nick, I know that you've seen these things out in the market, too. Why do you think that DG is seemingly having a moment here in early 2025, when the rest of the industry is a little bit facing concerns and headwinds? Well, a little side note to begin with, as of this morning, we count 20 DG platforms seeking capital in the market. I think we're probably around there, too, in terms of what we've reported. I'm sure there are more that we're missing, too. With our ownership group, we're not among them, but we're certainly sympathetic to some of the situations that people are in where timing is really a factor. It's not necessarily seeking capital for absolute need or desperation. There are cases of that, of course, but generally, this is the challenge when you go and you make abrupt changes to market forces and legislation. People have had multi-year plans and are looking to recycle capital, if you will, or load up for the next round. I've been a banker and I've done this. These things are planned years and years in advance, and so we definitely see that. I think notwithstanding the fact that there's a number of platforms out there seeking capital, I think if you're interested in distributed solar generation, it's never been a better time. You nailed it earlier. For its pros and cons, we have a shorter lifecycle of project development. It is not necessarily short, but relative to other technologies and applications of solar, clearly, it has advantages. We can take a site from a field of dreams, take a site, Greenfield, and convert that into an operating power asset three years, two years, four years, but it's in that ballpark of range, sometimes a little quicker, sometimes a little slower. At the end of the day, though, that's our business model, and that presents us with just a number of profound advantages, particularly when there's this relatively short-term. For power, three years is very short-term. Our utility-scale cousins in the industry are five years or more often for projects, could even be much longer. I come from a more traditional power background originally, where I don't look at natural gas. I look at natural gas as a complement. Combined cycle is very important and very powerful and a huge part of the power economy going forward, but that's a five- to seven-year build from scratch. I think what's the latest five-year turbine, I think, Andrew, right, something like that these days? I think what we're hearing is that you're not going to be able to get a turbine until the earliest 2029, so yeah, about that. That's with the right connection, someone like yourself, right, who can pull some strings. That's a profound problem in the market today in terms of supply. We have no such limitations for us. I mean, there are, of course, supply chain issues that you have to address, but you're talking fundamental problems for others. I think what's interesting is that the dynamic you're describing, that quick turnover time, that relatively quick build time, that wasn't always seen as an advantage for your part of the industry. I think in the past, a big part of the utility scale game plan, so to speak, was we will lock in a PPA price based on current costs, and then we'll take as long as we can before we actually build, and by the time we're building, the cost of this equipment will have come down and our PPA price will be relatively attractive because of that, and in the last two to three years, that's just completely reversed. Now all of a sudden, with supply chain issues, with inflation, with now the threat of tariffs and other changes to policy, that needle has pushed in the direction of distributed generation because these costs aren't dropping like they were. Am I right? Yes, absolutely. There's a couple of other factors, right? Look, I think it's important to look back and really think about this and not move away from jargon and other things that people often throw in and just look at the facts. With rates where they were, with where scale was, it made a lot of sense to pursue utility, and there's a reason why distributed generation maybe didn't have such a focus. You could make great money utility scale. Your unlevered and levered returns were pretty attractive at a certain point, especially in a levered basis. You could get really good scale. There's fantastic value in that and the ability to be able to do 100, 200 megawatt projects. If you look at some of the ones that were done even five, six, seven years ago, you're doing 100, 200, 250, 300 megawatt sites. At that time, distributed generation was still muddling around in the one mega threshold, and that was a fairly good ... I remember myself as a banker being really proud that we did a two megawatt site. I remember telling my mother about it 10 years ago, like, wow, I'm really moving up here, and now we would be hard-pressed to do a two megawatt project. Distributed, that barely makes the threshold in terms of size and scale. Also just the volume. I was looking back at a deal that I had done. This company is going back out to the market, and it was a landmark transaction at the time. I won't bother with the name of the company out of respect for them, but that was six, seven years ago. It was a landmark, a whale of a deal, and it was 130 megawatts of operating assets, which by comparison today would be quite small among DG, not tiny, but on the lower end, the smaller scale. I'm not sure that would be in the top 10 of DG IPPs at this point, and at the time, that was a large deal. So the game has changed. It's just a different level of maturity, a different level of scaling, and also if you look at our business and sort of the best peers that are out there, they're well-managed businesses that can do volume these days, and that makes ... that's just a significant difference. Hold aside the speed to market. Hold aside the buying leverage we have now and some others of distributed generation. I think also, let's face it, community solar, it maybe is not forever a thing. Maybe it's not. But that, the emergence of community solar really, a friend of mine, Graham Smith, gave me this term way back when, when it first came out, the democratization of solar, that people can actually access solar in a unique way, a unique business model, also helped us quite a bit. It just made it more palatable for utilities, I think for state legislators to enact legislation. We hope more states will do this, but if you look at it, that's another great way that DG has really shown its value and found its place, right? So there's been the mechanisms put in place. A lot of things have gone our way for distributed generation. It's just taken a while. And another problem when you look at utility scale, one of the biggest challenges everybody always talks about is interconnection and transmission. That's on the top of everyone's list when they're saying what needs to be better for renewables generation in general, maybe even above policy certainty. Is DG as exposed to these problems, to the issues around interconnection and transmission, or is your part of the sector a little bit insulated? Well, early in my career, I was a young looking man with nice flowing locks and dark hair. And then I got involved in utility scale interconnection, and then I've never looked the same. It is one of the most challenging parts of the industry, no question. We're very sympathetic to the situations and the kind of lack of control. I think it's pretty well publicized, and Andrew, you do this on your other discussions around the challenges in MISO and PJM in particular, where you just, you don't have, the mechanisms are not in place. No matter how hard an ISO tries, no matter how hard the systems and the people, the good people that work in power and transmission try, the challenges are really tough. We just don't have that in DG generally. It's not that it's a guarantee, it's not that it's super quick, but if you look at the markets that we're primarily in, the various markets in New York state, for example, where we have a large presence or Illinois, where Ameren and ComEd do, we think a terrific job in terms of transparency and openness. You're starting to see more of this. And for example, in Pennsylvania with some of First Energy's entities and PPL and so on, they're doing a lot more and getting more, and there's obviously a lot of other states that they've just got a routine of doing this, a different process. And it's less intrusive, let's be fair. The barriers, the challenges, the pressure you put on the system is just more balanced. And it's a big advantage for us. It's more common sense, I think, for a lot of these states to kind of almost crawl, walk, run through DG, as opposed to some of these larger utility scales. And we see that also on the permitting side, candidly, the land side, assembling land and permitting and some of the pushback you get in some of these states where maybe they're just warming up to solar. DG is sort of a great way for states to acquaint themselves with the benefits and kind of ease into a larger scale scenario and market. I think you're seeing a lot of this, for example, in Illinois. Well, it's really interesting. Well, Nick, it's been great having you on the podcast. We've talked about a lot. There's a lot more we can discuss. We'll have to maybe have you on again sometime, but Nick, thank you so much for joining today. Hi, Andrew. Thank you for having me. Always a pleasure.

I'm Matt O'Brien, Reporter and Deputy Managing Editor for Infralogix North American News Coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest, someone who's going to give us a close look at the Macro Tower Marketplace and the corresponding carrier budget impacts, M&A, economic concerns, and more. I have with me, President and CEO of Vertical Bridge, Ron Bissing. Welcome to the show, Ron. Thank you. I thought for today, the way we'd kick off this conversation is maybe talking about the carriers. Whenever I go to industry conferences, it's always a major topic, major theme. Last couple of years, we've seen the carriers pull back on their budgets, which obviously directly impacts the macro tower industry. I was hoping maybe if you can give us your outlook on that. It seems like these guys are, you know, the victory or lightening up on the purse string, so to speak, allocating more budget to the wireless space. What's your take and what can we expect to see in the coming months? Great question. I think you're right. Your read of the tea leaves is right. The carrier activity has picked up significantly from last year. In fact, you know, we're 2X the amount of leasing revenue that we generated this year compared to the same time last year. In addition to that, there's a vast number of new towers being built throughout the country. I think many people know that we have a first of its kind JV with Verizon to build towers for them in America. We're seeing a tremendous amount of incremental activity in adding new build-to-suit sites for Verizon and all of the other carriers are investing as well in their networks. RBC Capital puts out a report every year that estimates the number of new cell sites that will be required in the upcoming year, and they're forecasting a 70% increase year over year from 2024, so a lot of activity. I think that this persists for at least the next couple of years. We're seeing a tremendous amount of C-band densification as carriers roll out their networks, a lot of cell splitting, and some of it is also tertiary markets. What I would call your attention to is during the pandemic, where did everybody work? From home. Now, there are still people that work from home, and the carriers are addressing some of the homework needs by putting more and more of their network spend closer to where people live and not necessarily at the office building. Gotcha. I want to just pivot over to Vertical Bridge itself for a couple of minutes. How are things working now on Vertical Bridge's deal with Verizon, the tower deal you guys struck last year with Verizon? What goals has the firm yet to achieve since striking this deal with the company? When you do a deal of this size, you have a transition services agreement because there's a vast amount of data that has to be assimilated into your system. Imagine four terabits of data coming over all at once, all different documents, millions of documents that need to be put in the right places in the Vertical Bridge system so we're able to effectively operate the assets. That transition services agreement lasts six months. We've just extended it by three, but we're 90% through all of the various tasks associated with the transition services agreement. The last remaining tasks will be cutting over accounts receivable and payable. Paying your landlords, receiving the rents from third-party tenants. That's one of the things that we've yet to complete. And then probably most importantly, and it will be hopefully an ongoing goal of ours, is to add tenants to these towers. These towers were very lightly tenanted, 1.15 tenants per tower. Verizon wasn't truly a tower company. These were for them. These were self-built by them, although they did build them with a tremendous amount of incremental capacity, but they really weren't leasing space to others. And when they were, it wasn't as efficient as it would be if you're running a tower company like Vertical Bridge does. So adding the tenancies to the towers is job number one. That's where you get your return on that $3.3 billion investment that we made when we struck the deal with Verizon. Sticking with Vertical Bridge, I was hoping you can give the listeners an update on your guys' equity raise process, something we've been following here at InfraLogic. I'm just wondering, what kind of guidance can you give us on how things are going? It's going really, really well. There's no shortage of interest in investing in the tower space. There never has been. It's somewhat of a scarcity value to have the opportunity to make a significant investment in such a terrific business. We're being very prescriptive about how we go about this. And it's extremely important that you get the right partner in the boardroom, right? So we're seeing a tremendous amount of interest. We're working our way through the process. I expect that it won't be too much longer before we have something maybe to talk about. So it's going really, really well. All good things for you guys. All right. I can't wait to see what the outcome will be. I'm sure you and I will talk about it once you're able to, and I'm sure it'll make for great copy. Kind of related to that, just talk more broadly about M&A actually. Tower, macro tower M&A has been subdued in North America for the last few years, with the exception, you know, a few recent announcements, a couple of breaking news items from us. Since we've had this activity a little bit muted, where can investors find opportunities in the tower industry, maybe from an M&A perspective? Sort of the last remaining large scale deal with a carrier was the one we just did with Verizon. Other than that, the remaining carrier portfolio out there would be U.S. Cellular, which is around 4,500 towers. Now U.S. Cellular has maintained that they're going to operate that business on its own after the merger's done with T-Mobile. To me, that remains to be seen. They may do that for a period of time, but you know, I'm not convinced that over time that particular portfolio won't transact. I think it probably does, but until the merger's done, until the rationalization of the assets is complete and they determine which antennas they're going to keep on which towers and the churn has worked its way through, I think it would be difficult really to see that portfolio transact in the marketplace. There are a number of other small, medium sized companies ranging, you know, anywhere from you can have 10 towers to over a thousand out there that could be acquired in the future. But what's happened in this business is people have pivoted from private equity to family offices to permanent capital sources. So you take CDPQ and DigitalBridge, they have much more of a longer term. They're our two largest investors, our primary investors. You see more and more of the pension funds and folks like that looking for investments. And once they're in those investments, they want to be there for a long time. So I think the opportunity for an investor is really in a situation like we're in at the moment, we're out raising capital. And also when companies that have some scale decide to recap. So recapitalizations will give you the opportunity to make significant investment in sizable tower companies. And of course, if you can make an investment in a company like VerticalBridge, that works as well. Absent that, I think it's just a number of smaller acquisitions that could be had in the space. But you need an operator. Right. Right. Just a follow up question on the M&A point. We always see macro towers, portfolios, or even co-operating companies sell at these high multiple, you know, in the 30s range. Look, we're in an elevated rate environment. Do you think that is that still true? And I know the asset class is thinly trading in North America, as I pointed out a few minutes ago. But do you think we'll still see those elevated headline buyout multiples? We haven't seen any material change in multiples in the last five years, really, which was kind of surprising to me. But I think when you look at the characteristics of towers, the very long term stickiness of the contracts that the tenants have on the towers, you think about the growth aspects of many of the towers that have come to market. You know, look at Verizon, 1.15 tenants per tower, a lot of growth left there. The investor sees its way towards buying into a stable, long term growing cash flow business with relatively fixed operating expenses, a one time investment, and all the revenue from the lease is falling straight to the bottom line. Gotcha. Also, another follow up question to a more transactional point of view. The financing markets, you know, not equity, but just from what you've seen debt, you know, raising financings, whether you're pursuing an M&A deal or fresh deal or building out new assets. Do you feel like the debt markets are still open to the macro tower sector? Or do you see any challenges there? Whatever you're seeing would be interesting. Well, sure. I mean, they're open for business. Certainly not the glory days of next to zero interest rates. So there's money to be had. It's just a little bit more expensive. You know, we take the approach of setting up bespoke credit facilities that we can throw assets into, essentially let them grow cash flows and then take them through an ABS securitization. So that's the way we've approached it. In the ABS, you probably get the most efficient execution and the cheapest cost of debt. They're open. We'd love to see the cost of that debt come down, but for now, it's stabilized, which is good. Gotcha. I mean, we're seeing other sectors and in a digital infra industry, fiber and data centers tapping ABS more and more. And it seems like, you know, the cell tower industry was the first one there, again, within the digital infrastructure marketplace. You know, I see these guys doing it and it just seems, you know, they're taking a chapter out of that playbook of refinancings and keeping your cost of capital structure low. We're actually going to launch an ABS this month and we hope to be closed by the middle of August. So we're going to be hitting the ABS market. I saw Symphony came out a couple of days ago and they're tapping the ABS as well. You made an interesting point. The ABS market was flooded with data center, right? The first tower issuance, and I wouldn't call Symphony necessarily straight down the middle tower issuance because they have ground rights interest in that particular ABS. This will be one of the first ones in quite some time. And I think the appetite for a tower ABS at the moment is pretty significant, right? It's a safe haven, if you will. Right. Insurance companies, infrafunds, or what your typical investors in those instruments, I would gather. Yes. Permanent forms of capital. Yeah. Gotcha. Interesting. Are private placements, you know, a dead instrument, tower operators, I can't recall seeing any, but is that something that could be used, you feel, in your industry? I think the cost of the equity would be too expensive. I know of some that have been done, but not at any scale years ago. But I don't think that that's something that, you know, you would see unless it was a very small private placement, a small investment. Let's turn our attention to macroeconomics. As we see, look, you can pick up the newspaper any day, there's always headlines, headwinds in economic landscape. We're talking about tariffs, talking about a labor market, rates, you know, take your pick. More generally speaking, federal government policy reforms are getting all the headlines. What challenges are you and your team at Vertical Bridge concerned about, more of the trends at large, if any? Well, you know, we're in a very capital-intensive business, as you know, and rates have a meaningful impact on investor returns. So we're being very judicious with our use of capital, our underwriting process, you know, what our tolerance is for returns, and picking the right acquisitions to do and also the right sites to build. From a regulatory perspective, it would be helpful in the industry to take out some of what might be considered unnecessary steps in order to permit a tower. So the typical timeframes of permitted towers are from 15 to 18 months. Carriers would like to see some of that time shrunk, reduced, right? And in order to do that, some of the federal regulations that are imposed upon the industry would need to be adjusted. The government is discussing that at the moment. So to the extent that some of those steps could be removed or at least shortened, I think it would benefit the advancement of the wireless carriers of the industry itself. And as far as other regulatory issues, it would be really nice if we could get some spectrum in the hands of our customers. And there's not any near-term spectrum forecasted on the horizon. Some say five years, could be seven. Now, for us, we kind of win either way. Absent spectrum, the only way to provide the service to the customer is to densify the network, the type of service that they're looking for. But even when there is new spectrum, we've always seen a corresponding investment in the network. The spectrum doesn't necessarily sit on a shelf, they put it to use, and that benefits towers and the rest of the infrastructure ecosystem. Gotcha. I want to go back to that point you were making, I guess it was permitting reform, right? That it can extend the length of certain projects, probably true for any infrastructure project you're embarking on, if it's a road or whatever have you. But is it more of an issue at the state level or are you seeing more impacts at the federal level? It can be both. So we have NEPA and SHPO and a bunch of hoops that we need to jump through. For example, we couldn't build a tower in California until the sand fleas had hatched out of the ground. I'm not kidding. There's some unnecessary steps that we unfortunately have to take in order to check the particular boxes. And it's both federal and state. It's better than it was. I've been doing this for 35 years. It's better in some instances than it was because there was at least a defined process, but there are a lot of little steps along the way that you have to take. Sand fleas. Turtles. I think I have my next idea for my next story. So there we go. No, gotcha. You know, one thing I want to ask you about tariffs, are you guys seeing any additional costs being built up in your projects or even operationally because of tariffs? Yeah, at the moment it's been an insignificant increase in steel costs and that's really where we would see the most effect. But from a supply chain perspective, we have had a couple of very minor issues with getting steel delivered from Canada, for example. So with the tariffs, have the tariffs affected our cost base? Not that much, but they have some effect on supply chain. So we're shifting as much as we can to tariff friendly places and getting as much steel as we can from the U.S. as well. One of the things we benefit from is scale. So we tie all of our steel purchases to the indices and that way it can't fluctuate up or down too much. So we win in the good days and we share some of the risk in the bad days. And because of our scale and the number of towers we build every year, we pre-buy and lock in pricing similar to what Southwest did when they started pre-buying fuel and they were able to keep their fares really low. So we lock into that price. If the tariff goes up, we're protected. Yeah, gotcha. No, great. All right. Hey, listen, I think that's it. All this was great. Ron, I want to thank you for participating. So thank you and the team at Vertical Bridge. And thank you listeners for listening to this week's Crossroads podcast. And don't forget to like, subscribe and share. Well, that's it for this week. Don't forget to tune in next time. Until then, take care.

I am your host, Eva Llorenz. Today, we have as our guest, attorney Manuel Quinche, partner at the Colombian offices of the global law firm, Cuatro Casas. Mr. Quinche is an expert in project structuring, project financing, infrastructure, energy, mergers and acquisitions. He knows everything. He provides advice in all types of projects. He is also a professor of corporate finance. He has a law degree from Rosario University in Colombia, a postgraduate degree in commercial law from Andes University in Colombia, also on a master's of laws in corporate law from New York University. And he has been a recipient of numerous awards, including lawyer of the year. Welcome Manuel to our podcast. Thank you, Eva. This is a great opportunity to meet you again. Manuel, there have been concerns about delays faced by in 4G and 5G highway concessions in Colombia. We would like for you to shed some light for us as to what is happening. What is the problem? What are the main factors contributing to these delays in highway concessions? Sure, Eva. Before answering, I would start by saying that the 4G program in Colombia has been an unprecedented success. And to be honest, it's not only a success for Colombia, but also a success for the region. And there is some interesting data to give you context on why I think this has been a true success for Colombia. As you probably know, and the audience knows, the 4G program comprises the construction and rehabilitation of approximately 30-something-tall roads. These are, in other words, more than 6,000 kilometers of roads. And up to date, the 4G program has brought to Colombia approximately $130 billion in investments. And at this point in time, construction progress is about 91%, 92%. The program has created more than 100,000 jobs. And I wanted to say this because, of course, when we talk about delays in the program, it sounds like it has been a failure, but it hasn't. In reality, it's a true success for Colombia. Taking now your question, I guess that as any massive infrastructure program, 4G has faced several challenges that at times have delayed construction, at times have resulted in conflicts with any or the government, and at times has resulted in fears and concerns for investors. To name some of the issues, I would start with the most obvious one, which is the Colombia complex geography and engineering challenges. Doing construction works in Colombia, and specifically tall roads, is not an easy task. Colombia does have a very complex geography, and that explains the reason why, for instance, we are having construction delays. We have a difficult terrain that includes mountainous regions and areas with heavy rainfall, for instance. That complicates construction a lot, and that has created the need, for instance, for extensive tunnels, bridges, and really many technical challenges for construction. Out of this, I would say, of course, as you know, there are international companies doing construction in the 4G program, but also Colombian local companies, and that's important. That's one of the successes as well, both for the international engineering companies, but the local companies that have been able to deal with all these challenges. When we talk about 91% of progress, we are talking about that construction overall has been a success, even though the construction issues. We have also faced institutional legal framework issues. As you probably know, earlier generations of road concessions in Colombia suffered from poorly structured contracts, imbalanced risk allocation, and opportunities for frequent renegotiations. The 4G program introduced, as you know, a more standardized P3 contracts and improved risk allocation, but needless to say, legacy issues and the need for further institutional strengthening have still contributed to implementation slowdowns. We also face, as part of these delays, as you can imagine, there were financing and currency risk, securing sufficient and timely financing for this program has been a persistent challenge. The 4G program is a large-scale program that requires or has required an estimated investment of more than $24 billion. And at the end of the day, it is heavily dependent on both international and local financial markets that over the course of the past 10 years, as you probably can imagine, are markets that have faced significant challenges. Also fluctuations in the Colombian peso and exposure to local currency risk have made international financing less predictable. And as you can imagine, also the financial capacity of local banks and the need to move forward, mobilizing the pension funds have been critical factors. And of course, I wouldn't say they do have created delays, but because they didn't, but at the end of the day, posed very specific challenge, for instance, for the pension funds to invest in these projects. One of the, one additional factor of difficulties for the 4G program, and really for any concession program, it's the Colombian overall fiscal pressure. As you know, the rating agencies are talking about these days, especially because Colombia is facing a problem on this, and fiscal reforms are needed. So with that in mind, of course, that slows down implementation because simply they need to have a clear fiscal framework and availability of resources to undertake these projects. In addition to this, and this is something that we are facing right now, is that we are having, let's say, delays in launching new projects. It was true that before Mr. Gustavo Petro took office as president, we were seeing a very good pipeline of toll road projects. That's not the reality these days. Those projects have really slowed down, and the National Infrastructure Agency has said at the end of the day that launching new toll road projects is not their priority. They are focusing on other types of projects, and probably that would continue to be the case until the end of the Petro government. So with that in mind, as I said before, there are challenges. But having said that, the program, when you look at it in its totality and the benefits that have resulted out of it, I would say it's been a total success. And remember, it does have a 91% of construction progress these days. So we are really almost reaching the other side of the tunnel. I was going to ask you if you could provide some insight into the Colombian government, how has the Colombian government responded to some of these concerns or these challenges? You mentioned that concessions or that these type of projects have slowed down. So I'm just curious as to what are we going to see and what is going to be the Colombian government's response to that? Let's start by saying that the current government has created a somehow difficult environment for concession projects in Colombia. As you have probably heard, and the audience have heard, before taking office and even after President Gustavo Petro took office, the government hasn't really been friendly to concessions. And it has indicated their preference for major infrastructure projects to be conducted directly by the government and not really through concessions. At different times, the government has made announcements that if implemented will have resulted in serious material breaches to the concession contracts. Fortunately, I would say the existing legal and contractual framework for concessions has stood in a way that concession contracts continue to be honored by the government as per their terms. And this is very important. This is not a minor thing because sometimes when you hear all this noise around the toll road concessions and the government sort of opposing them in many ways or trying to reach to the accounts in trust to make available the monies that are supposed to go to concessions to other purposes. When that happens, of course, everybody gets nervous. There are zillion questions about it. But the reality is that the legal framework and contractual framework for the FARG program has really stood up all those challenges. And that's very good news because that shows that it was a very well structured program. I would say that assuming that Mr. Petro's current political party loses the forthcoming presidential elections and a new government takes office to the extent that that new government would like to be continued to the successes of the FARG concession program, you will have to do several things. First of all, you will have to strengthen the ANI. The reason for that is because we've seen a slowdown in their activities. As I said before, we are seeing less and less projects. So we need to strengthen that institutional capacity that got somehow weakened during the Petro administration. Then, of course, an absolute need for the government to launch new concession programs. With that in mind, all fiscal pressures will need to be addressed because you can launch the program and you can make road shows around the world offering new concessions. But the reality is that if the government is not able to really solve the X on the equation on fiscal stability, it's going to be very difficult to sell these programs. We will need and will need a government that improves coordination and oversight on these projects. And the reason for that is because, as you know, several, for instance, governmental entities and agencies are involved in these projects and the environmental authorities, ANI and other types of authorities, and to the extent they do not work in a coordinated fashion that ends up, of course, delaying any program. So we will need to improve on that and, of course, take measures to attract global capital to these new projects that could be launched in the future. And those measures, of course, include having a government that is friendly to these types of infrastructures. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Khinche. I would like to change the topic a little bit and talk about the railway projects, because when Mr. Gustavo Petro took office, he said that he was going to bring back railways to Colombia. And what I have heard is that it has been a slow start in this sector. It seems like the Governor Petro's railway projects are moving forward slowly. Could you give us some insight as to what do you think are the problems in that sector and what can we expect? Sure. The railway sector, it's an interesting one. And let me also give you some historical context here, because we are facing a situation for the railway network in Colombia. The situation is that it has been historically underdeveloped, underutilized, and when you compare it to the road infrastructure that we just talked about, it's many years behind. So we do have an issue there. These days, the total length of the railway network, it's approximately 3,000 kilometers. And it's primarily used for freight and especially cold transportation from the Cerro de Hombas. Another aspect of the problems is that passenger rail services are almost non-existing, I mean, they are minimal. And it's really limited to a small tourist routes in the city of Bogota and some daily service around the city of Barranca Bermeja. I would say that the crisis of the sector started after a state-owned company called Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia was liquidated in the 90s. And that really led to a decline in passenger and freight services. Since then, all we have had for the railway sector in Colombia has been really fragmented operations, super limited investments, and a focus, let's put it that way, on a very few profitable freight corridors. The issues there, as you can imagine, again, is the challenging geography, historical underinvestment, and a lack of integrated planning. So the sector has been, for many years, stagnating. Having said that, I'm going to answer your question. Yes, when Mr. Petro took office, basically he said that one of his focuses, or the current focus would be to basically promote railway projects. Those I would say, at the end of the day, have had problems, let's put it this way, in the stage of structuring. Some of them have had difficulties structuring their financial models and so on. And the level of production of these types of projects has been really, really, really slow. Today, what we have in front of us, it's really one project, which is actually one railway project, that's a major infrastructure initiative for Colombia. We're talking about a freight corridor of approximately 500 kilometers, and that, for Colombia standards, and by any standard, it's very, very important. On that, as you know, the project is being developed under a P3 structure. And in April this year, basically, the Colombian government executed the contract for the rehabilitation and modernization of the railway line. This investment, of course, is expected to significantly improve freight transport efficiency. It would reduce logistic costs, and it will stimulate economic growth along the corridor. With this in mind, of course, this is what we have in front of us right now. The government has announced other initiatives. For instance, we have the Regio Tram del Occidente, the Regio Tram del Norte, the Tren de Cercanías del Valle, the Tren Intermodal, the high-speed train from between the cities of Medellín and Bogotá, and the Pacific Coast Railway Network. It's hard to say at this point in time which one of those would be launched before President Petro leaves office. Having said that, the benefits of these projects are substantial, and we all hope that not only will they be a real success because it's an important project, but we also, of course, see the need for basically reviving the railway sector in Colombia. I would like to ask you about the airports, but before I do that, I want to ask you first about potential mergers and acquisitions in the infrastructure sector that we may see in the future as a result of what is going on in Colombia. I believe, to be honest with you, that the next years, the name of the game, in essence, would be M&A activity in the infrastructure sector, and there are many reasons for that. One of them, but it's not minor, as it happens in some other countries, construction companies, for instance, are very used to bid for projects and to win concessions and to basically structure them and finance them and so on. They are used to that, but they do have a different business. Their business is construction. To the extent that happens and to the extent that they are not, let's say, in the financial concession business, whenever a project reaches a completion and starts operating, the question immediately comes up, whether it will be the time for that construction company to sell its participation in a specific project, probably to a fund or to a financial investor or to a professional infrastructure, toll road investor. So when you think about it, seeing that we have more than 30 projects, I would say that would be an obvious trend and a trend that it's really, really starting. As far as we know, first hand, there are a couple of sale processes going on as we speak. But in the recent months, other processes may close. For instance, the sale to Patria of the Pacifico 3 concession, it was a very relevant transaction and shows or somehow proves what I just mentioned on what are the reasons why this is going to become a trend. Also, to the extent, for instance, that we continue to have volatility in Colombia and a weak peso and so on, it would be the case that these concessions may become attractive to investors looking, of course, to basically take advantage of lower prices because of the market situation. So I would say we'll be seeing that a lot, as I said before, and probably it's just normal that it happens. I don't think that trend that is starting reflects some sort of distrust in the concession program, not really. What I would say is totally the opposite. It's the normal course of business for the sector. And of course, one owner exits and another comes in. And usually, for instance, we are seeing a lot of international players interested in these concessions. That's a minor because, of course, one thing would be saying, yes, there will be activity, but it will be fairly local, just formed by local investors and so on. But that's not being the case. Actually, it's totally the opposite, and that shows how the international investor market continues to see the Colombian market. Could you provide an example of a sale that we're going to see and an international player that is interested in it? There are a couple of processes going on. We are participating in some of them. And what we are seeing is a rumor has been in the market, so I can talk about it. The potential bidders that you see are the usual suspects, right? Those usual suspects are usually major international companies, major funds, international funds. So there is appetite. And I believe, as I said before, that this is going to be really a trend for the coming years. I have one final question. What can we expect in terms of airport, new airport infrastructure projects? I understand that there is a tender going in in November. I think it's DMAX, if I'm not mistaken. And then there's also Odinza also has proposed the one in Cartagena, the airport. But I'm just curious as to whether these airports are obviously going to happen and what can we expect in that sector? What should we expect to see? This is a very interesting sector because this is one of the, let's say, private sectors that has been in the good graces of President Petro. And the reason for that is because, of course, when you think about airport infrastructure, well, you're thinking about tourism and mobility within Colombia and internationally. And this is a government, for instance, that has said that they would like to build a very strong tourism platform for Colombia. So the airport infrastructure sector, it's a sector well perceived by the government. And going beyond that, actually, the Colombian government has embarked on a significant modernization and expansion program for this type of infrastructure. This program is driven by the need, as I said before, to accommodate growing passenger and cargo traffic, improve competitiveness, and attract, obviously, new investments. Currently, we are looking at the renovation of five major airports. This totals approximately a program of $3 billion. These projects are being structured as PPPs with concession agreements typically ranging from 10 to 25 years. The projects that probably you'll keep hearing about is the Rafael Núñez Airport in Cartagena, a new international airport for the Cartagena region that will be located in Bayunca, the Gustavo Rojas Airport in San Andrés, the airport for the city of Cali, and, as you said, El Dorado Max, which, of course, would be an iconic project for Colombia the same way it was many years ago when it was converted into a concession. We have a very interesting panorama for airport infrastructure. Those projects are happening as we speak. We are at least working in the financings for two of those projects. So I would say that's one of the sectors that hopefully will be only good news. May I ask which two projects are you working on in financing in the airport or you cannot say? It's one of some of the ones I mentioned. Some of the ones you mentioned. Okay, I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much, Mr. Khinche, for talking to us. I certainly appreciate it very much and I hope everyone enjoy this program as much as I have enjoyed it. And thank you very much for talking to us. Thank you, Eva. And have a good day.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Today we will have one big, beautiful podcast to discuss the sweeping domestic policy legislation that passed the House last week. And we have Julian Dumoulin-Smith, a Managing Director and Research Analyst in Jeffries Power Utilities and Clean Energy Equity Research Group. Julian, welcome to Crossroads and great to have you on. Andrew, thank you so very much. I appreciate the opportunity to join you here on Crossroads. Julian, can you briefly tell our listeners what Jeffries Power Utilities and Clean Energy Equity Research Group does? We are an equity research shop. We fundamentally rate stocks by sell hold, right? So it's fairly transparent in that way. But really at its core, you've got to understand what's going on in space, right? We take views specific to the sector trends and obviously politics around that in terms of deciphering what that means for the stocks. The main reason that I'm really excited to have Julian on the program today is because I think he's the perfect person to talk about the sector in light of this one big, beautiful bill. I think a lot of people in the sector are eager to read all of your equity notes, and it's always a point of discussion. A secondary reason I'm very excited to have Julian on is because we actually grew up right up around the corner from each other. We went to high school together, so it's good to have an old friend on the podcast. Yeah, incredible how the world turns out this way, isn't it? It is. Who knows? There must be something in the water around that part of Hastings on Hudson that drives people to go into the energy industry. Totally. So before we dive into the substance, can you tell our listeners a little bit about your background, how you ended up in this part of the sector? Look, I got involved in the space really as a function of looking at the intersection of politics and economy, and really what people's daily decisions are being made of, right? I mean, energy faces us constantly, and more to the point, it's really a technology sector, right? It is ever-evolving. It's hard to see its manifestation in any one singular way, but actually that's been the biggest pleasure through this all, is just to see how vibrant and dynamic the situation is. It is not static. Even in my short two decades in the space, basically, it's changed dramatically. And frankly, I think that rate of change is going to persist. So last week we published a story on the Republican-led House of Representatives passing legislation narrowly that we quoted somebody calling it a nuclear bomb for the clean energy industry. I know you described it as a sledgehammer to the Inflation Reduction Act signed a few years ago. Julian, how bad would this bill be, and right now it's just a proposal, if it became law? Look, I mean, I think there's a tale of many different worlds here, right? I mean, how difficult would it be? It really depends on the end market you're looking at. Look, to take the industry expectation, right, I mean, people were expecting a scalpel, right? They were expecting nuance. They were expecting a general phase-out, right? But this is next level, right, admittedly, right? And I think in many respects, what you need to remember about this is that a lot of the changes were done in the middle of the night, right? So at first, there was a tangible sense of relief a couple of weeks ago when it was first introduced by some constituency saying, look, they could have gone further. Then we saw the middle of the night changes from the Freedom Caucus. That really changed the MO, right? They inserted a bunch of, like, twists, right? And I think implicit in a lot of this, I just want to call it out, there's a broad expectation that the next administration fundamentally extends these credits, right? And so as long as you're able to survive, shall we say, the next three to four years, you've got a backdrop that you can at least hope Senate Finance Committee, et cetera, extends this again, which has been the cat and mouse game that has existed for renewable tax credits for over two decades now, right, this back and forth, the see-saw of tax credits. So that's where a little bit of the nuance was. By having this accelerated phase-out at the end of this administration, it leaves you going into the next administration without that phase-out, right, without that understanding of what was to happen. And look, we've seen these things expire before and get retroactively renewed, et cetera. So look, it's not the end of the world. And certainly, it reduces the scope of what's at hand. But I also wouldn't call this thing anything close to a scalpel. This is much closer to that sledgehammer. I mean, there's a lot of nuance embedded within this. Honestly, I think that folks have to appreciate. Adam, I think you're definitely right. If you read the tone of coverage, both in terms of your letters, in terms of my report, our report, after the initial draft came out, there's a lot of optimism, A, because it wasn't so bad, at least compared to expectations. And B, I think there was a thought that some of the threats, and the FEOC is one we'll get to, were maybe a little bit unintentional and would be ironed out by the full House. That once a handful of House Republicans who have been supportive of renewables got their hands on the bill and said, hey, listen, we have to fix these few things to make them more workable. What came out of the House would be something that was better, that was not an improvement in current law, worse than current law, but better than expected. And I think there's a lot of shock in the industry that they went the opposite direction, that what ultimately passed the House was worse than the original proposal and really didn't fix some of the concerns. I mean, is that lining up with what you've seen? Yeah, Andrew, look, here, I would put it this way, right? People thought that what you're going to see originally was the worst and it was only going to get better from there. And the fact they saw real backpedaling there drove caution about what happened in the House, but also caution about who's going to step into the Senate, right? I mean, the degree to which this was effectively pushed back, right? People had sent all these letters to care about clean energy, and yet at the end of the day, it all fell over when push came to shove, when Trump got involved. That's what really gave people pause, not just about the House process, but even about the Senate process. You can sign letters all you want. How real is real? And so I think that's what you saw some capitulation around. But again, look, I want to stress, when you think about the different end markets here, it's not just the utility, it's not just solar writ large, it's not just wind writ large. It's about breaking it down into the individual silos, right? The smaller scale solar, right? The residential, the commercial end markets. That's what you're most concerned about here. Like when you think about larger scale renewables and specifically larger scale solar, look, a lot of that's going to persist simply because you don't have alternatives, right? You've got demand growth. There's going to be a build out. And so honestly, look, who pays for it? Again, we talked about the Inflation Reduction Act, right? It's simply going to be inflationary on those people buying it, right? So again, whether it's a data center or some other reshoring manufacturer or what have you, or frankly, just end consumers, right, they're just going to end up paying more of that fully loaded price as you build it out, because it's not like you're going to pivot at this point saying, oh, well, it was a subsidized space, and so therefore, I'm going to pivot back to a fossil alternative. At this point, the fossil alternatives have also inflated to a level that I don't think it's as fungible decision tree as people would like to claim, right? The reality is it's just going to raise prices. And what are the point those prices are going to be borne by consumers, and that's just going to play itself out. If you were to bifurcate across the spaces, look, the utility scale sector is going to be more intact than people care to admit, mostly because demand is going to be met with the buildup, and you're going to still see a lot of utilities and industrials move forward with their roadmaps just as much as you would think. Now, I think it's on the smaller end of the spectrum that you got to be concerned. And then adjacent to that, to hit the wind market in brief, look, I think the wind market's been stymied by permitting even before this whole IRA narrative got off the ground, right? I mean, the issues that we are seeing about just being able to get wind done is the bigger headwind here than it is IRA. Now, look, again, I'm going to stress this point. We're all making the assumption that the next administration, and you're effectively punting that to the next administration within year-end 28 phase-out, right? The next administration is going to either extend this to some modest degree or really going to be responsible for the full impact of what that does to consumer pricing. That's the critical nuance here that you got to watch. The Trump administration is going to keep the tax credits in place effectively at full levels through the pendency of the administration. So in many ways, there may be an ironic twist, you'll have a pull forward of demand, right? Well, get it while it's hot, get it while the tax credits exist, and you may actually have an acceleration of activity depending on how it's ultimately structured in the next couple of years. And it could really fall off in pro forma 29, for instance. Well, that's interesting because I have been reading some pretty dire predictions. I read a white paper by Segway Sustainable Infrastructure this morning, for example, that said that this would result in half the solar wind and storage set to go online between now and 2033, which is more than, you know, 500 gigawatts to be scrapped. It sounds like you think there aren't going to be a lot of cancellations. It's just more going to affect the pricing, PPA pricing, consumer pricing, etc, that these are going to be built either way. Well, look, Andrew, let's be very careful because I see a lot of these forecasts that are pointing out in the 2030s. Look, that's really where a lot of the investment was going to get like the magnifying effect of the tax credits, right? In the near term. Look, the reality is you have the tax credits to 28 and you're effectively living to the next administration. That's going to dictate the pace of adoption, right, in many ways, right? Because you're going to have technology, again, emphasis on technology cost curves coming down and you're going to have the benefit of the credits and that double whammy really should enable adoption in subsequent periods. To me, you know, the nuance on how much gets done really boils down to do we get some degree of latitude from the Senate, right? You've got these nuances from China as it pertains to the FEOC, a foreign entity of concern. It basically is a supply chain question about not just looking at components, but where do you get your subcomponents? Where do you get your critical minerals from that go into these products? You know, how aggressive they want to be in enforcing it or how ambiguous the administration wants to be and how timely they are in proclamating some of these underlying rules. That's going to dictate the outcome of clean energy just as much as the IRA at the superficial level will. If you don't give clarity on what procurement and supply chain needs to look like, it'll also stymie the sector. So again, it's too early to tell quite how far it's going to go. But look, I am not going to subscribe to these dire forecasts about the space in the medium term. In the longer term, sure. But I also really want to underpin this, right? I mean, you are seeing active inflation of fossil alternatives in a way that like, let's not kid ourselves, energy is going to be meaningfully more expensive in the future. So I get that the credits going away has an impact in an isolated static world, but it's a dynamic world out there. And the reality is it's going to be inflationary across the board. And frankly, I would lean in and say that for as much as you're going to see renewable companies price up, you're going to see the fossil companies price up as a function of this too. Everyone's going to take advantage of the situation and say, look, I'm going to charge more. I think that's the batch. Well, you brought up the FEOC. I think that's a really interesting, the foreign entities of concern provision. I think that's a lot of the panic in the industry has focused around that. I think the goal there was we don't want Russia, China, Iran, North Korea investing in these companies, owning these companies, if they're going to get tax credits. I think the concern of the industry is that it was written so broadly that no company with any secondary connection could feel confident that they can get those tax credits. I mean, do you think there's going to be clarity and what would it mean if there wasn't? Look, I think if there's not, like, I think what you're going to see is folks running for the door to get in before these things go into effect, right? FEOC, as it turns out, again, depends on the permutation of the bill you're looking at, whether it's year end or year out or what have you. The point is that FEOC provisions would only go in after a period of time. So there's an exemption period, let's call it a safe harbor. So you're going to see a lot of people kickstart construction of projects in name or otherwise in the next handful of months in order to get past these exemptions. So really, in many ways, this is also a tale of whether you're a large incumbent that's well prepared with a balance sheet and working capital to speak to. Or if you're a smaller developer, again, emphasis on small versus large, the smaller guys are not going to want to put down the capital. They want access to the capital to go start construction. And so therefore, they're going to be much more impacted by these provisions, right? Conceivably, you've got larger companies out there who are going to step in and say, look, I've gone out, I put capital down, I've now effectively ensured that everything I'm doing is going to be compliant from an FEOC perspective through 2028. That's not my fight to fight, right? And so I think to a substantive extent, you're going to see market consolidation, right? This sector has become much more competitive in recent years, right? That's a secondary effect of the IRA, is it become much more competitive. And I think as a function of this undoing in part, is actually it's going to make the sector less competitive, right? And you're going to see consolidation amongst some of the entrenched competitors. Now, it was probably some degree of an organic consolidation and attrition that was happening and is happening anyway, to be fair. But I think this is going to accentuate that outcome. Because again, you are going to need to move decisively in order to lock in and quote unquote safe harbor your credits through the end of 2028, to lock in and make sure you've gotten this exemption from FEOC and more to the point to lock in and make sure that you got your projects going in terms of what's being called tax credit transferability. And again, tax credit transferability is really another key linchpin to the reforms here in as much as if you can't sell the credits, and most of these companies are unprofitable at their core because they're project subsidiaries, look, they need to be able to monetize credits and the market is not deep enough to go back to the historical forms in which they monetize credits. You have to have that latitude. So effectively, in some ways, another way to sink the space has been to stymie transferability, which is another thing this bill seeks to do in part. And so that's why, again, it's not just the face out. It's the nuance on FEOC and the nuance on tax credit transferability that really hamstrings the industry depending on how it's actually implemented in the final bill here. That's interesting. Our listeners will know we've talked a lot about transferability. It's been a huge success story since the IRA with various structures emerging to allow investors to get involved, monetize those credits and everything. Before we leave FEOC, I do want to say we really kind of scratched the surface. It's a very complex topic here that kind of deserves its own podcast. I'm not sure. We don't have anything planned, but I do recommend I don't usually recommend other podcasts, but I will recommend one that I listened to this morning, The Currents Podcast, which is Norton Rose Fulbright. They put out a episode devoted to FEOC on May 22nd. So if listeners want to learn about that topic in more depth, that would be a good one to check out. Now, you mentioned transferability. I mean, how much of a concern is there in the industry if that goes away? Is all of a sudden a lot of these tax credits just going to be theoretical? I wouldn't call it theoretical. I would say we go back to a market that's more traditional. We call it tax equity, and I think that's where we're going to go. In many respects, you go back to that and the banks step up and effectively monetize on their behalf, on a sponsor's behalf, the tax credits. And so that's a viable avenue to go down. Again, admittedly, it becomes very much limited if you want to do a lot of it, right? Just the tax capacity of the banking and financials industry to be able to get this done is a very relevant conversation point. But again, I think the bigger conversation on transferability ends up being, look, if you're going to use tax credits as part of government policy, not just in clean energy or otherwise, there's a cogent argument to be made that you want to move towards transferability writ large. You don't want to take a step back, right? So I think ultimately the financial services industry overall is actually behind the idea that even though they stand to benefit, there's a real narrative that you want to enable transferability. You want to be a broker rather than necessarily just enabling it in your own niche using your own tax capacity. This issue matters a lot and it matters not just for the core deployments of storage and solar and wind, but it really matters also for like capturing manufacturing tax credits themselves. So again, I think that's important. And adjacent on the FVOC, people were expecting FVOC for months going into this revision, right? This was not surprising in the least. I think the twist on this all, frankly, is more about where we're going around some of these other arguments around, well, look, let's go to subcomponents or critical materials. I mean, to what extent if you start going down this rabbit hole in clean energy, again, just think about the broader implications. You are going to stymie the ability for industry to manufacture before it gets going. You talk about reshoring, sure, but like the difficulty here is if you start to create this as a precedent, the next industry that you want to take down, you impose the same kind of restrictions and you end up in a very difficult place to actually do this, right? Again, how quickly and swiftly can you move your supply chain? And by the way, this is for an industry that already predicated on IRA, was already moving away from the use of China to begin with because it was incentivized under IRA a few years ago. So again, I don't want to overstate the issue, but again, it's an important one, regardless whatever sector you're in, to watch this because the ramifications in adjacent sectors are quite real. Absolutely. And when you look at the tax equity versus tax credit transfer market, when the IRA was passed, the tax equity market was, I don't know, 20 billion, what have you. And the thought was, well, transfer will kind of balance that out. Some of that will go to transfer. Really, the tax credit market or the tax equity market stayed the same, and then a massive transfer market grew alongside it. And I think, first of all, maybe that's why it was targeted because they saw savings there, but that's also why a lot of people in the industry are thinking, can traditional tax credit now just absorb all of that growth? Are we going to have the tax equity market double in size? And I think there's a lot of skepticism there. Well, Andrew, look, I think the other piece I go back to, this is where the incumbents win. This is where those with balance sheets and have put down capital win. If you're able to save harbor and preserve the integrity of the transferability, as is already and continues to be proposed, even in the most stringent versions of this bill, you can get the exemption on FEOC and you can get the exemption on the transferability if you start your projects now. And honestly, the largest players already have. They did it as of year 2024 because they saw this coming. They saw the election happen. In the 4Q last year, they said, look, we're going to save harbor everything under the Biden era rules, section 45, section 48, et cetera, et cetera. The point is, all of this was already done with those that have balance sheets. And so the arguments are a lot of this is impacting those that don't have the ability to put down the capital to, quote unquote, start a project. Again, let's come back to one big other change that we're expecting here, and this is going to be the so-called place in service requirements, the idea that you need to finish a project by year 28. This itself is probably the most anathema to the space. If I think that there is one glaring change, again, we talk about a lot of different twists here, but I think this is probably the most cogent one to focus on. Why? Because look, the industry is constantly struggling with permitting. Permitting reform, it's a bipartisan subject. It's a subject that transcends energy technologies and is no stranger to renewable energy. If you think that renewable energy is coasting along on permitting, you're kidding yourself. It's not limited to the fossil sector, right? And I think because of those issues, that's going to resonate with folks who want continuity. Look, it's not going to be a race to finish projects by year 28 when you're facing a bevy of different permitting issues. It makes no sense. It's going to impede real project development. It's going to create, the key term here is business continuity. You want to have visibility that you can continue to tap into these tax credits despite putting reasonable continuous efforts into finishing projects and have the latitude to say, look, if you slip by a few months, you don't lose, use it or lose it, right? And that really, I think, has some degree of traction as a space where the entire energy sector is increasingly facing permitting issues. It's not like this is getting better. It's not like it's poised overnight to change, right? I think that's where this whole narrative energy permitting came from. But more to the point in this manifestation, that's why it's going to get traction when it goes to the Senate. And ultimately, I would argue that's one of the most important things to look for is they're going to give you the latitude to say, look, if you do face issues, finish it the subsequent year or more to the point, give you a little bit. That was the whole idea also, partially behind having a phase out over the subsequent years to give people latitude. But again, that idea that you need to place in service by year 28 or what have you, that's probably the most important needle mover here in the next few weeks. That's definitely something we have heard a lot of. This would create a binary risk where if you miss it by one day, you get nothing or you completely miss out on the credit. And that's going to affect how these projects are going to be able to get financed in certain cases. It's going to affect all types of financing. And I think, again, it's probably something I wouldn't say it benefits anybody, but that the larger players are maybe able to weather more than the smaller players. So you talk about the bifurcation. This is another example of that. Yeah, I completely agree with you there. Look, I think another angle here, if you want to keep going down this avenue, is to think about what's next. Right. When you think about the credits here and what avenues to get targeted. Look, I think residential solar in that space is really going to be one of the big question marks that play out. Because in this bill, look, they've taken out Section 25D, which is for consumers. That went by the wayside first. And then secondly, now we're talking about, are they going to get rid of leasing structures? I mean, this is going to be where some of the hardest felt debates and fights are going to play themselves out here in the next few weeks. In many superficial ways, people can confront solar, not because they go out into the desert and find these things, but they see them on people's homes. And while that's not necessarily the most efficient way to go about it, it's the most tangible way to both impact the industry in a way of saying, I did something by removing the policies that enable that, A, or B, conversely, by sustaining that. So again, that's where this hits home. That's what is the biggest debate out there. And frankly, look for the nuances around leasing solar to really get hashed out intensely. And again, it's not obvious which way the cookie's going to break on this one, but that's going to be the biggest pain points as you guys track data points across the space in the next handful of months. We haven't even gotten through all the possible negatives, all the possible harms to the industry. Before we end, I do want to focus on some potential positives. Are there any areas where the final bill that made it out of the House was an improvement? Are there any potential winners? I know you put out a note recently about nuclear as one example of that. Yeah. Look, I mean, I think nuclear has got some small, look, they fought for and got back some of their interests. Again, when you think about who's the key players here, especially in the Senate, you're going to see that. And again, I look again, you think about place and service. I know I am not finishing my nuclear plant by any given timeframe, and that's not conceivable. And more to the point, extending that out and keeping the nuclear industry afloat had been a big mandate earlier, and that was a big compromise earlier. And so I'm not surprised to see that. Renewable fuels, again, you go back to the farmers and the ethanol producers. Think about them. They got an extension in this bill. It's not an accelerated phase-out, they actually got an outright extension. So again, this bill is not all bad for everyone. You got to look at the nuances. Yes, at the end of the day, the nuclear piece didn't necessarily survive. The manufacturing, advanced manufacturing credits are not necessarily going to phase out as fast either. Right? Again, I think the core focus there is going to be a little bit more latitude there. Again, even though you implement some of these FEOC constraints that limit who can participate. That's sort of the silver lining. Look, the biggest silver lining here is simply that demand is still growing, right? If this was happening in a different environment in which people were much more price sensitive, we'd have a much different conversation. But because you've seen the cost of renewables increase tremendously over the last few years, even net of IRA, that might sound counterintuitive to people, but that's the reality on the ground. Right? You're seeing permitting issues. The inability for supply to keep up with demand is what's driving the pricing higher and meaningfully higher in the last couple of years. And it's only going to trend higher on the back of that. Interest rates, capital costs, frustration and tariff-related permutations have all stymied the sector. Execution's a real problem. Let's talk about execution. Let's talk about what else is out there. And I want to rehash this a little bit. It's about how these rules actually get implemented. It's about having labor availability and having the visibility on what you want to do. Because it's not just one day, hey, look, here are the new rules. Go and have at it. If it was that simple, sure, the industry would have not as much of a problem. But the reality is that you're going to do this and then you're going to go hash out in front of the IRS a bunch of the corresponding rules. That's a problem. That's an implementation difficulty that what? So we're going to sit and wait a year or two to figure this out, right? Look under the IRA. It took a couple of years for even the Biden administration to hash this stuff out, right? So the idea that the Trump administration is going to have some sort of courage to move decisively and swiftly, look, they're not going to have the incentive. And I think that's going to be the secondary impact that we need to be watching for here as far as what the impacts are. And again, I think the interesting twist is, and maybe this is another nice point to try to pass back to you on, is the biggest year for data center build out is going to happen to be 28 from what I can tell. And that 28 is going to happen to be when projects are incentivized to finish construction. So the big question is, if you can give people the clarity to run with projects and safe harbor and move forward as anticipated, even under this refined bill, you're going to see a big build out 28. But again, the difficulty is between the FEOC procurements, between the transferability issues and frankly, given the litany of implementation issues, just of getting clarity out of IRS, you may very well punt the ability for this industry to respond in a timely fashion. Labor is not easy to come by. Construction workforce and engineering workforce is not necessarily ready to scale up when there are so many other infrastructure sectors ready to roll. And I think that's the biggest issue here is you can't move on a dime. And so amidst the backdrop of seeing the data center demand boom, really, I don't want to use the word crest, but certainly reach a new peak in 28 and have the pull forward. You're going to have a big build in that year, even under this permutation of the bill. The question is, can you actually get it done given all the corresponding follow-ups that are going to be required after the IRA actually passes? Well, this is when you talk about renewables, certainly an industry that has some experience working against ticking clocks and deadlines and political uncertainty. So while the last few years of the IRA have removed that a little bit, I think that the industry, it's not unfamiliar territory having that deadline that they don't know whether it's going to get extended. That said, I think people are watching very nervously to see what comes out of the Senate. And I think a lot of confidence and sanguinity was shaken by the fact that some of the renewables backers in the House that they expect to be stalwarts against this type of a rollback either slept through the bill or switched sides or didn't show up. I think we heard a lot about the 15 Republicans who signed a letter saying that they should not roll back the IRA. And that didn't end up being the firewall that people were expected. Well, Julian, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. It was great to have you on. And once this is all settled down and whatever bill is ultimately passed, we'll have to have you back on to make sense of how things sorted out. Absolutely. Hey, thanks, Andrew, for the opportunity.

Welcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. We're joined today by two attorneys of counsel at Robeson Gray. Pete Scherer, who's based in Boston, is part of the firm's real estate investments and transactions group. He represents private equity clients, endowments, and financial institutions, among others, in commercial real estate acquisitions, dispositions, and financings, with experience across the full spectrum of asset classes and structures. Dima Orandarits, based in London and also in the real estate investments and transactions group at the firm, has advised both lenders and sponsors on high-profile real estate finance transactions. His experience ranges across real estate classes, including data centers, logistics, and student housing. Pete and Dima are going to help us explore recent developments in the data center space, following up on a recent commentary from Robeson Gray on what they called the taxonomy of data center investment. Gentlemen, welcome to Crossroads. Thank you, Liam. It's great to be here. Thank you, Liam. We wanted to explore a little bit, following up on the commentary, what the difference between the traditional real estate investor approach to data centers and the usual infrastructure investor approach, just to get us started. Thanks, Liam. I'll start us off, and I'll let Dima sort of layer in on top of this response. I have a bit more of an equity background, and Dima has a bit more of a finance background, so hopefully we can, together, bring the full picture to this podcast. I think we started, to answer that question, you need to start with the basics of what makes a real estate investment, historically, versus an infrastructure investment. In our view, in my view, the key to a real estate investment is really the focus on the ownership, development, management, disposition of a real estate asset. Physical plant, the buildings, historically, we're not talking about toll roads or telecoms. That has ripple effects throughout the structure and what you focus on, for example, in diligence. In real estate investing, you'll have a lot of joint ventures. You'll focus on concrete diligence issues, such as title, entitlements, leases, environmental review, and a little bit less on things like operational risks. For traditional infrastructure, that is an investor that is focused on long-term, stabilized cash flows, typically tied to physical assets with a moderate risk return profile. I think it's much more typical, historically, at least, for an infrastructure investor to be investing in an operating business, so they have more experience around considering operational risks and taking a go-forward perspective on the considerations when evaluating the cash flows for an overall platform versus an individual asset. That's a long way of saying it's a bit more of a PE style, historically, investment as compared to real estate investment, where you'd have a prop co and a JV or a prop co and an opco. It may be a more vertically integrated structure. Dima, I don't know if you wanted to add anything on the top of that, just from a general or from a debt perspective of how you view infrastructure versus real estate. By all means. I think when you look at a data center or other infrastructure asset from a real estate finance perspective, you mostly focus on the asset, as you said, which would be true for a real estate equity investor. Real estate finance providers, they want to be close to the asset. That's true. Their underwriting is focused on stable lease cash flow. Valuations are based on net operating income primarily. In terms of financial covenants, they would be typically focused on LTV and DSCR or debt service coverage ratio. In terms of due diligence, their focus will be very similar to what you've described. They will be focused on title and the asset, whereas the infrastructure investors, they will be much more focused on stable cash flows. Their underwriting will be primarily based on discounted cash flows. And in terms of diligence, they will probably put a bit more focus on contracts to ensure the cash flow stability and things like power resilience, uptime resilience and connectivity. I would mention those things. We've been hearing a lot at Infralogic lately about the trend of bringing together the varying approaches to data center investing. Can you guys give us a sense of what's driving that trend and what it looks like? Sure. I'll start this one again. You know, I think calling any trend and giving a narrative way to it means summarizing or trying to capture a bunch of sort of disparate drivers that all put together, no individual cause, but put together are sort of causing the market to adjust. And with the background, I think there's a bunch of different factors that have sort of led in the past couple of years and a continuing trend for some of these historical silos between infrastructure investing and real estate investing. And I would even put in there PE investing to start to blur. From my perspective, I think probably the biggest driver is the elevated interest rate environment when central banks throughout the world started raising rates. That has a bunch of knock on effects, especially for such capital hungry assets as data centers. As interest rates increase, asset values are somewhat depressed and that has a knock on effect of slowing dispositions, further knock on effect of slowing capital raises for traditional strategies. Right. So you have all these traditional sponsors, the machine that was expecting there to be low interest rates for the long duration got knocked off its planned trajectory. And so you have a lot of, I think, sponsors in the private markets across historical silos trying to sort of fine tune and adjust their business models in response to that. Driver one. Driver two, I think data centers, especially with the advent of AI, which had been bubbling for a while, but really hit the scene only a couple of years ago, is just this enormous, enormous demand for capital and this huge potential growth market. So you have these absolutely mammoth companies thinking that this new initiative is existential to the risk and it's hugely capital intensive, but there's just a huge rush to meet that demand. There's headwinds in many other sectors. So you have real estate investors saying, Hey, this looks pretty great. There's demand. I can raise capital. You have PE investors who are saying, Hey, it's harder to make opportunistic or value add returns for my traditional plays. But like these data center platforms look good. You have traditional infrastructure investors saying like, Hey, don't forget about me. I was here the whole time. Right. So you have a confluence of drivers. And I think I would put on top of that, at least in the real estate space, for a long time, real estate had a pretty stable business model. On the equity side, you had capital partners who would bring money and networks and connections and asset management skills to the table. And you had local developers or operators who would bring a deal pipeline and local skill sets together. They would do a joint venture. It was a standalone basis. Over the past few years, there's been some evolutions, which is a whole separate topic, but some evolutions in how those economics are split between traditional LPs and traditional GPs with each sort of poaching each other's business. And I think since that existing trend in light of the headwinds facing the industry generally, in light of the attractiveness of data centers as a general asset class, in light of traditional PE investors looking for new opportunities, it's all coming together where all these groups are starting to sort of look at the same asset with a slightly different lens and realize there are some synergies and some differences and it's leading to a real hybridization. Take for example, combining an infrateam with a real estate team. The infrateam may have some more experience to understand how to underwrite operational risks and some perspective there. The real estate team may have a much better handle on development risks or title risks. And you put those together, the whole is potentially greater than the two halves, especially in a competitive marketplace. Again, Dima, sorry for always going first, but I don't know if you have anything to add there. Obviously, I agree with what Peter has just said. But to add to that, I think data centers, they are appealing to both real estate and infrastructure investors and lenders because they possess features which are most appealing to those two different types of investors and lenders. On the one hand, you have a physical asset, which is something which is historically interesting to real estate focused investors. On the other hand, you have an operational asset, which is part of critical infrastructure with stable cash flows, long term cash flows. And those are features which are historically more attributed to infrastructure focused investors and lenders. So when you take a data center that combines those features within one asset, and naturally that brings the attention of both classes of investors and lenders. On the other hand, apart from those just features, as Peter has said, it's an appealing source of cash flow. It's reliable. Yes, it's operationally heavy. And that's why you need to possess expertise in both what's typical for real estate investment and what's typical for infrastructure investments. And that's where you see the convergence because even within one organization, two groups may be reliant on the expertise of each other when they underwrite an asset such as a data center. Great. Thanks. In Robson Gray's recent commentary on data center investing, it seemed like you were warning against applying the wrong set of experiences to data center investing. Why would a firm try to take another approach to data center financing from what they've done in the past? And what are some of the risks if they take one they're not familiar with? To answer in reverse order, why you might take a different approach, I think, draws on maybe you're just getting into the space, but you come from a PE background, right? And so I guess it's you have a natural bias, or some of the drivers we were just talking about on the consolidation, it's a competitive market. You're seeing some of the synergies at play and you want to explore those things. So I think that's what's driving investors to rethink things. But as far as the risks, I think our comments, or I know our comments, were driven at the basic human tendency to revert to what you know, right? And so there's always a bias if you come from, let's say, a PE background to assume that what you've been doing for the past 10 years is the best way to handle investment and to look at assets and businesses as just that, as businesses and vertically integrated and focus on the operational risks, right? But I think you need to have some self-awareness that real estate is a big industry. There are norms and customs that are there for a reason. For example, a traditional joint venture is a pretty good way, a pretty efficient way to get a building built. And so if you are just wanting to get some exposure to data centers, let's say, and you're somewhat platform agnostic, well, then you may want to look at more of a traditional real estate structure, depending on sort of the specific details, because it is in fact a pretty efficient way to deploy capital, to access the real estate lending market, to learn from your operating partner. And I actually think that's why you're seeing on some of the bigger data center platforms, you're seeing a lot of big news about hyperscale campuses with joint ventures below the platforms, right? And historically, maybe they would have tried to build those centers on their own, but when it's a one-off asset that's going to be built and they have the operational skillset, they're effectively the operating partner, and it's a good way to bring in additional equity. I think the same applies for traditional real estate investors. As I mentioned earlier, there's been some evolutions in the real estate investing market generally, but I caution my clients who have been exploring those topics to really think long and hard if they're equipped to handle an operating business. That means not just understanding the differences of the underwriting standards, but like, do you know anything about laws governing employment? Do you know anything about competitive terms for executive compensation? Have you ever set up like an IP system? Are you ready to have all these questions around just running the business and branding and whatever else flow up to your investment team where normally you just look at the real estate and you look at how it's performing and you sort of have some expertise and you understand title risk, you understand design and construction risk, but like those are pretty discreet issues. And historically in real estate, you've deferred all that operating messiness, you're operating partner, right? So if you want to sort of invest in the platform, all of a sudden it's your issue. And that may make sense for an investment and it may not. And I think our commentary is really focused on like, this is an exciting time. There's a lot of innovation, new ways of doing business, all which is great. There's an element of like, if it's not broken, don't fix it. Think long and hard about your specific situation and your specific deal and don't just sort of chase what's new and shiny. Right. So keep on your skillset. That's exactly right. It's like, I'm going to stick to being a lawyer after this podcast versus going after your job, Liam. Yeah, that's right. And I think Liam, I would probably just add that obviously you may be over-reliant on your particular expertise. So if you approach a data center financing as a real estate investor, you may be misunderstanding income risk, because if you come to it with a lease-backed cashflow approach, you may underestimate the technology obsolescence risk and how that will impact the lease income in the long or medium term. You may underappreciate development risk because not every real estate investor would think about connectivity delays necessarily when approaching something as a real estate investment rather than as a data center or infrastructure investment, which is heavily reliant on power. Some investors may overpay for stabilized assets because they underappreciate the operational risk of the asset, like a data center or any other operationally heavy infrastructural assets. So those factors should always be kept in mind. Actually, Dima, I wanted to follow up on one thing you mentioned. Again, with my biases, which I wear proudly as a real estate guy and an equity guy, you know, I think sometimes that people try to overcomplicate data centers. At the end of the day, it's kind of a big chilled box. But there's a counterpoint to that. I think one of the things that like my client base looking at data centers needs to understand is that this is not like an office building that is leased to a bunch of law firms, right? The off-take contracts for data centers are an animal unto themselves within the real estate world. If you have disputes or terminations, it's very different than like evicting a tenant. The whole concept of performance credits, where if the data center operator doesn't meet uptime requirements or on-time delivery, there's these pretty punitive penalties potentially for against the platform. That is pretty rare, not impossible. But like most tenants and most other aspects of real estate don't have leverage to negotiate anything close to that. You know, the economics are completely different from a traditional real estate lease. And so again, it's just this area where data centers just cut across a lot of norms. And I think both on the investing on the legal side, you know, you really need practitioners who kind of, or teams assembled of groups of practitioners who have experience in both spaces to really be successful. Great. Thanks. We really only have time for one more question. And I did want to get in a little bit of an exploration of other asset classes other than data centers where you're seeing some convergence of real estate investor and infrastructure investor activity. I mean, can you give us some examples and how that's playing out where you guys work? A hundred percent, Liam. We see some convergence, not only in data centers, because obviously data centers is one of the prime examples of this convergence. But assets like telecom towers, for instance, historically more suitable for real estate investors. Now they're also viewed as part of critical infrastructure and that makes them more appealing and interesting to classic infrastructure investors. The assets which maybe historically were viewed more as real estate investments, such as logistics or cold storage, they are becoming increasingly interesting to infrastructure investors because of the added automation and the critical need and that they're required in the global supply chains, which makes them more attractive to infrastructure investors. New asset classes such as EV charging stations, for instance, combining real estate and infrastructure like features and things like battery storage, for instance, which is similar to a certain extent to data centers because it's being viewed by infrastructure investors as part of critical infrastructure, more on the techy side, yet it involves a physical asset, which is of interest to a real estate investor. And I would add to that a little bit more of social infrastructure, but senior housing and student housing with the common theme being that those are real estate assets. But like data centers, there is value to investing in the platform as an operational vehicle versus just the physical real estate, the bricks and sticks, as we say in real estate, because of the specialized nature of the management or the specialized nature of the buildings or in the case of senior housing, needing to understand how the regulatory regime affects the investment structures. You're not just setting it up with maintenance and janitorial services. You have a lot more going on in both those cases. Exactly. And especially on senior housing, I have learned it is state by state and there is a true moat where you need the platform and the experience to understand how to navigate it. Great, guys. I'm afraid that's all the time we really have. Thanks so much, Pete and Dima. Really appreciate your coming on. Thanks to everyone in our audience for listening.

I'm Anofrio Castilla, senior reporter for InfraLogic, joined today by Damien Beauchamp, president and CEO of Eight Rivers Capital. Damien, thank you for being our guest. Thanks for having me. Pleased to be here. I wanted to have this conversation to follow on the news. We reported that Eight Rivers is raising TopCo equity and is compiling an advisory roster for Project Finance. The project in question is the Wyoming Carbon Capture Project with Pacific Corp., which has, as you told me, a CapEx between about USD 1.4 and 1.6 billion. And that's a 250 megawatt repowering of the Dave Johnston and WIDAC coal-fired generation units. To start this conversation, could you describe the technology you propose to repower these assets and the implications for other coal-fired assets in the U.S. and perhaps abroad? The technology for the repowering in Wyoming is based around a technology that was invented here at Eight Rivers that's referred to as the Allum-FetVet cycle. So the Allum and the FetVet portions of that pertain to Rodney Allum and Jeremy FetVet, who are the named inventors on this thermodynamic power cycle. What the power system does effectively is it'll take any fossil fuel, and Eight Rivers is focused on solid fuels, like how do we clean up the emissions from, say, coal, and it will take those fossil fuels, combust them, but then inherently capture all of the CO2 in the system without the use of an adsorbent, such that as the CO2 comes out of the system, it's at pressure impurity for utilization and or sequestration. And the other neat feature of it is that the CO2 is actually used to drive the turbine to produce the electricity. So it's a way to produce really low-cost, reliable, 24-7 power in a zero-emissions manner. And that's what gets us excited is the energy trifecta, as they call it, we believe can be achieved with this system. These are coal-fired units that we're talking about, but I remember there's a biomass component here, too. So could you talk about the introduction of biomass into the system, the novelty of that, perhaps, and conversations that I know you've had with hyperscalers about this project and whether or not feedstock is important to them? When you fuel the alum-fipit cycle, or AFC as we refer to it in short, with biomass, what you end up generating is negative emissions electricity. This is something that actually goes beyond, say, a purely renewable asset like solar or wind, which generate and generates zero emissions where we could actually go net negative. And so what that means for the system is it primarily has two products that it can sell. One, negative emissions power, and then two, carbon removal credits. And what's really interesting is if you look at direct air capture systems today, most of them only sell one product, and that's a carbon removal credit. With AFC on biomass, which we also call biome, we're able to effectively subsidize the CDR price with the power price from the facility. And so we can achieve carbon removal credits on a per-ton, dollar-per-ton basis that go far below what they're currently being sold in the market for today. And those conversations with hyperscalers, are they concerned about using electricity that's generated from coal, perhaps more than they already are? On the coal side, there still is a decent amount of sensitivity there. I do think that the biomass fired system is certainly going to be higher on the priority list because they can get the electricity, the negative emissions 24-7 electricity that they need for their use, their data centers, while at the same time generating the carbon removal credits that they're already purchasing, but generate those carbon removal credits at a much lower price. And so effectively what it allows for is as they purchase the power, they are inherently generating CDRs. So the demand they already have is creating a supply of another thing that they want at a lower price. And we see that as really a win-win for the data center space. On the coal side, whether or not we start to see a moment where hyperscalers become less focused on fuel input, where they're less focused on fuel and more focused on emissions, we'll see what happens over time. But I think the right approach is to be focused on the emissions outcome rather than the fuel input. Can you describe your pipeline beyond the Wyoming project a bit? How many of these do you have in the works and at what stage of development might they be? It's been really interesting over the past few months for our AFC system. We recently have had multiple parties come to the table wanting to effectively displace existing emitting assets with the AFC power plants. I've been doing this for 10 years and I've come into a situation I didn't expect to see. And that is we have multiple entities right now vying for unit number one. And so in addition to the Pacific Corp pre-feed that we kicked off at Sarah Week in March with Wood Group, we've recently signed another pre-feed agreement with another party that is not yet public. But that work has now kicked off and is underway. And we're in negotiations with a third company to start the same. So we're effectively this year going to have three pre-feed feasibility studies running in parallel. We may have a fourth or a fifth add to that list. But then at the end of 2025, we'll be making an assessment as to which site has the highest viability to go all the way through COD or its commercial operation date, COD. And it's exciting to have multiple options because in project development, roughly 10 to 5% of projects that are announced and are kind of started at this stage actually get through FID and COD. And so when you're going into it, you want to have more than one project available. And ideally, all of those projects have different distinct counterparty companies engaged because any number of circumstances can affect a project from permitting to local and state laws to the financial circumstances of the companies that are engaged in the project itself. And so that diversification is key, I think, to success, especially in deployment of a first of a kind. And kind of serendipitously, that situation has started to form around what we're doing with AFC. Are all these projects that you've mentioned clustered in the Western United States? How do you go about selecting sites for these? What are some of the key things you look for when evaluating a project or a potential project? I wouldn't say it's kind of an east or west play or north or south. If you want to understand where we're looking at potential projects, take a map of the United States, overlay on the map of the United States all the CO2 pipelines that exist, overlay all the class six wells that have either been permitted or are actively in the permit process. Then around those pieces of infrastructure and locations, draw a 50 to 100 mile radii circle. Within those areas, one has the potential to build a cost effective AFC plant. Now, there are other factors like electrical infrastructure, access to, say, water for cooling. You definitely want to have access to fresh water. You know, if you're needing to process a highly saline based kind of brackish water, you're going to see significant cost increases for water treatment, which aren't helpful for the overall plant economics. And so we distinctly avoid situations like that when we consider where to develop our projects. But the anchor is the CO2 infrastructure. And then from there, we start to do an assessment within that 50 or 100 mile radii to say, OK, what are the other infrastructure circumstances? Are you evaluating any sites in Appalachia? Appalachia would be really interesting. I think it has a ton of promise. The issue there, again, is existing CO2 infrastructure. So what I would say is like in the next five years, I don't think that it's a primary target for us. The reason being is there's no existing CO2 infrastructure. I think there's potential for CO2 infrastructure. I mean, one of the things that I think about is pipeline network that runs from Appalachia down to, say, some of the more southern states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. You could also take CO2 out of Appalachia by running it to the East Coast. Maybe you run it by pipeline. Maybe you run it by rail. Rail can be challenging, but it could be done. It is certainly technically possible. You could ship that CO2 down to the Gulf of the United States where there's a whole bunch of offshore sequestration that's being developed or at least suitable geology has been identified and acquired by various companies. And you could do that CO2 injection in the Gulf. So we've certainly thought about it. I think long term, it certainly has a lot of potential. I think it would do a lot of good for the workforce in that region and the repurposing. But also the stabilization and growth of the legacy workforce are the real advantages that we see long term and why we want to build there. What about the price of electricity? Can you talk about the value proposition there? The AFC was developed before there was a 45Q. So it was invented in 2010. And the first iteration of AFC received investment in and around 2012. And that was before there was a 45Q tax credit. The 45Q tax credit came later and was certainly additive. I think with inflation recently and the fact that 45Q, since its first release and implementation, has increased three times now. It's been increased three separate times. I think that helps offset some of the inflationary considerations for projects. So it certainly helps us. And really what it translates to is a lower cost of electricity, especially for the first of a kind units, which are going to be some of the more expensive units. We target with AFC somewhere between $50 to $100 per megawatt hour as being achievable. And the range really centers in on the project circumstances. There are some locations where you'll be able to monetize more byproducts than others. There are certain markets that have more elasticity on the power price side than others. Can we talk about your plans to export this abroad, particularly to coal-dependent economies? Yeah, our primary focus with the plants that we're developing in the United States right now is to bring in companies that are based in countries where coal utilization remains high, looks to continue, and potentially could increase over time. And we want to get them in as early partial investors to the U.S.-based projects so they can get some exposure to the technology, its performance, and kind of the development process so that they're more ready themselves to deploy this technology in their countries. And so places where we look right now are places like Indonesia, India, South Korea, Japan, Australia, things like this. Obviously, China right now is a huge consumer of coal. They're consuming more coal than the rest of the world combined. And where reductions took place in other parts of the world, China more than increased their consumption when compared to any reduction. And so China is certainly a huge opportunity for this technology, but certainly isn't the first location we're looking to deploy abroad for perhaps obvious reasons. Those obvious reasons being, of course, tariffs and the geopolitical tensions. But the tariffs in particular, what impact could those have on your U.S. projects? If there are 145% tariffs on Chinese manufactured goods or inputs, could you build these or do you have the ability to source elsewhere? I mean, without question, there will be some level of impact. The level of impact, I think we'll understand better when our prefeeds are complete. But having said that, we have looked at the overall supply chain for the various equipment and subsystems, if you will, that are required for a plant. And much of the equipment can be and is still manufactured in the United States because a lot of it is compressors, pumps, valves, and then also our turbine and then heat exchangers. And because of the large presence, especially down in the Gulf of America region, there's a lot of manufacturing base and capability still within the United States, at least as it pertains to deploying, say, one, two or three of these plants. I think if we were to start to achieve a much greater scale, it would be beneficial if the manufacturing base scaled up a bit in the United States to avoid these tariffs if they are prolonged. But for the first plant, we see some impact, certainly. We're bracing for that. But I don't think that we're overly dependent on equipment from overseas manufacturers or at least overseas manufacturers that don't have manufacturing facilities in the United States. Obviously, steel and the core commodities that then go into that equipment haven't really followed the supply chain up that far, but a decent amount of that does come from overseas. So we'll have some impact into any piece of equipment that is manufactured in the United States, if that makes sense. And then, you know, we've got a lot of pipe in the plant that's going to take different kinds of steel, different alloys. And so depending on where those different steels are produced will obviously have some impact. I'd like to pivot for a moment, if I could preface this with saying that I have roots in West Virginia. I grew up near the Mount Storm power station. I've been familiar with the national, really international debate around coal, certainly my lifetime. Is this to me something that could potentially, and I'm not seeing this anywhere, but it could potentially bring out environmental opposition in the hydrogen space? I think we saw a lot of people saying that, okay, these facilities are, you know, we're blending as concern meant to extend the life of natural gas. And I think things like that, you know, would probably be said about, you know, prolonging the life of coal assets. Does that pose a concern to your U.S. development efforts? If so, how do you manage it? Environmental concerns are certainly important concerns. In fact, you know, that's kind of at a river's core. You know, we were founded upon principles of doing no harm, if you will, or significantly reducing harm to the environment. Where we chose to focus our time in how to do that was around the emissions conversation and CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Well-informed environmental groups are certainly, I think, beneficial to the country and the world overall. And we've actually, I think, found some good common ground with those groups. And I've heard the argument that carbon capture will prolong the life of any fossil fuel. I started looking into this, and here are some of the details. One, the world has never used less of any single energy resource, even biomass. So if you look back to the 1800s, no source of energy has ever reduced in its consumption. That's biomass, that's oil, that's coal, that's natural gas, that's solar, that's wind, nothing. And so on that premise, if that's been true, then how are we to reduce CO2 emissions if we don't capture carbon from combustion? And then I looked at the fact that, well, this argument has been made for 30, 40 years. And over those 30 or 40 years, we really haven't deployed that much carbon capture at significant scale. Yet oil, gas, and coal continue to be consumed at ever-increasing rates. Again, I'm talking globally. And so how is it that carbon capture perpetuates or prolongs the life of oil, gas, and coal, when over the past 30 or 40 years since this conversation has started, we haven't really deployed a whole lot of carbon capture, yet the rate of consumption continues to increase? So what I came to the conclusion at is it's not carbon capture that propagates or prolongs the use of any one of these fuel types. It happens to be economics and the fact that everybody wants affordable electricity. Economic growth, population growth, sure. That's right. And if you look over time, CO2 emissions have increased significantly, as has the deployment of an asset or an energy source that doesn't touch fossil fuel. So that means that the deployment of a wind or a solar is not correlated with the reduction in CO2 emissions. The thing that's going to bring correlation between reduction of emissions is physically interacting with the CO2 molecules. It turns out that as important as removing CO2 from the atmosphere may be viewed by some, it's just as important to prevent it from going in the atmosphere in the first place. And that's really what we're focused on. The other thing that's interesting about energy use over time is I looked at coal because I've always heard these conversations about coal utilization going down. And that may be true in certain countries, but it really doesn't matter what one country does. And the reason it doesn't matter what one country does is because of the convenient or maybe inconvenient fact that the atmosphere is global. If I reduce emissions in one country by 100 percent, but I increase emissions in another country by 300 percent, I'm net 200 percent over where I want to be as a planet. And so I looked at coal consumption because I have the intuition that coal consumption had gone down. Coal consumption has not gone down on a global basis. Coal consumption has only reduced three times. Once during the crash of the Soviet Union, a second time during the financial crisis in 2008, and three during COVID. So what does that tell you? That says you either need a pandemic, a serious financial collapse, or the collapse of an entire nation and probably a nation that's a world power to see a net reduction in the consumption of that fuel. And so if we're going to continue to consume that fuel, somebody better work on a solution to eliminate the emissions from it because it's one of the most emissions intensive fuels that we use today. And that's really the foundation upon which we said, no, this is actually doing a substantial good to provide some solution to the emissions coming from this fuel type, given that the world continues to consume this fuel. And I think we also have the added benefit that we're not a legacy. We are not any kind of fossil producing company. We're simply looking for solutions to offer to the industry to eliminate their emissions. That's kind of the side we're on. And so far, many, many environmental groups have actually appreciated and I think see what Eight Rivers is trying to accomplish as overall positive. You know, we've not had much or really any coal development in the U.S. in quite some time, whether it's Page, Arizona or Farmington, New Mexico. The news is all about closures or has been. We've not had new development since there's a project in Texas in 2013 and then perhaps more notably five years before that in northern West Virginia and Preston County. That's called the cleanest coal fired power plant in the world or was so when it opened. My question is, who is even prepared to do this in terms of development other than you, but also in terms of providing the money, the financing? Have you run into a lot of hesitancy in the space or anxiety, maybe? From a financing perspective, we've identified plenty of support for offering a solution to the global emissions that coal generates. I'm not in a place to talk specifically about which groups we're talking with, but I think that there's a pragmatism that's starting to rise to the top after many decades of, I think, very good work that's been done and a very large penetration of renewable energy. And that needs to absolutely continue because it's a kind of all of the above for us. But I think that the pragmatism is starting to rise and it kind of goes back to my previous points. And that is peak renewable deployment, peak rate of deployment. But CO2 emissions are ever increasing. And so now what I'm starting to see is corporations and companies that were against coal no matter what are now saying, well, it's not so much the fuel, it is more along the lines of the emissions that get produced. I would say on the existing coal plants and the new builds, you know, at the beginning of 2024, when the whole hyperscaler thing popped off and you started to see supply chains get constrained, I started to think about how could a company beat everybody else to the table for access to power? And one of the things I thought about was, well, you could use the demand for electricity to take over near term retiring coal plants and actually decarbonize them based on a power offtake that would be strong enough to incentivize the building of carbon capture based plants. And when I looked at that list, there were a whole bunch of coal plants that were planned for retirement. Well, now with the uptick of significant power demand in the United States, I don't know that we're going to see these coal plants even retire. And so that's a factor that we're thinking about. So if they're not going to retire these coal plants, well, then we need to eliminate the emissions from these coal plants. And everybody we've talked to who's looked at a mean post-combustion says that it's way too expensive to put a mean post-combustion on the back of these very old coal plants. And so we're one of the only groups, I think, in the United States, maybe in the world, except for maybe companies I'm not aware of in China, that are looking at how do you build a decarbonized coal plant? How do you offer a solution in this space? Because if there is no solution, the thing that's going to get built is an emitting coal plant. To close us out today, I want to ask about some of the other activities that Eight Rivers has going on. We've been talking this whole time about Pacific Corp and related projects that you have moving in the U.S. as well as investors abroad. But there's the Cormorant Clean Energy Project, the ammonia production facility in Port Arthur, Texas, that's in our database. And some of our listeners may be curious about where that project stands now in terms of development and financing. So could you talk about that just a bit? It actually relates to the conversation we've been having. Because what that Cormorant project, it's an 8RH2 system. It's very similar with the oxycombustion and the recycling CO2, inherently capturing the CO2 from producing hydrogen from natural gas. But we're not using any absorbents to eliminate the emissions. And we're taking that hydrogen to what is the largest hydrogen consumer in the world today, and that's ammonia production. Ammonia traditionally is a fertilizer. It helps grow crops and food. And without it, the global population would not be able to be sustained. But there's a new application that's been identified for ammonia, and that's to co-fire it in existing unabated coal plants to reduce the emissions. So you generate the ammonia in a zero emissions manner. And then you can ship that ammonia molecule that doesn't contain any carbon and was produced in a carbon-free way. And then use that as a fuel in an existing emitting coal plant. And all that comes out is water and nitrogen from the coal fuel. And so we've been working on offtake agreements around that project. So we own 160 acres in Port Arthur. We're working our way through the permitting process of the 160 acres that we own. That's all well underway. There's been no showstoppers, and it's actually went relatively smoothly. You know, we've done a lot of the engineering, and now we're focused on offtake. We've recently signed a meaningful offtake for about 25% of the facility's production. We need to get to about 50%, and we're currently in the procurement process for another portion of the plant's production. And then on the CO2 side, we have found many counterparties that are capable and have executed a term sheet with one to take the CO2 and sequester it. And so that's kind of the status. So we're looking for some additional offtake partners, and we're also talking to prospective equity investors at the moment with an eye soon on the debt financing portion of the project. What will be the size of that debt financing? Maybe what's CapEx on the project? And will that 50% offtake be enough to start a project financing? We think that the 50 to 60% is enough. We've actually heard from different financial groups that there's interest in keeping a decent portion of that supply merchant. So being able to sell on a spot basis instead of, like, fixing the cost structure up front for the purchase. And so that's been an interesting revelation. But, you know, overall CapEx, 1.2 to 1.4 billion based on what we've done through an engineering exercise, and then adding in some of the inflationary costs and costs that may come as a result of the tariffs. I previously reported that on your top co-equity process, you're working with Santander. Are you able to say today who you might be working with on some of these project finances or who you are working with? I don't think we're in a position right now to disclose any of the advisors we're working with, but certainly talking with a few. Obviously, Santander has a very strong kind of project finance group, and they've done a lot in the renewable space. And so we look to them as a prime opportunity and partner around the project finance piece. Excellent. Damian, this has been a terrific conversation.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in. Today on Crossroads, we have Derek Benly, Partner and Head of Energy Transition at Salomon Partners. Derek, thank you for joining the podcast. Thank you for having me, Andrew. So for our listeners who may not be familiar, can you tell me a little bit about Salomon Partners and where you're active within the energy sector? Absolutely. Happy to. So Salomon Partners is one of the first boutique investment banks and has been around for over 35 years. And since 2016, has been affiliated with Natixis and their parent company, BPCE Group, which is one of the largest diversified banks in Europe and has a substantial retail banking presence. And the way that BPCE Group conducts its investment banking advisory services globally is through these types of boutique partnerships. And Salomon will generally North American focus. We work in very close collaboration with Natixis and the other boutiques globally. I've worked at several other global advisory firms in my career, I'd say that the unique partnership model actually drives superior coordination and insight. And it's worth noting that Salomon is independently managed. But the combination with Natixis really optimally enables delivery of the thoughtfulness, insight and focus of a boutique investment bank. with the global proprietary financing capabilities and reach alongside that. And Derek, you mentioned that you've worked for several global investment banks. What is your background and how long have you been at Salomon Partners? I've been in the broader infrastructure space for over 25 years. I've done project development, principal investing, and then obviously advisory that I'm doing now as well. As you mentioned, I lead energy transition advisory for Salomon. And while the remit is quite broad, there's definitely an infrastructure skew towards renewables and energy storage in particular, but also encompasses broader renewable fuels, carbon capture, clean hydrogen, EV charging, to name a few. And I came over to Salomon about a year ago and was previously at Nomura Green Tech, where I started and led the global low-carbon infrastructure advisory practice, which was the largest and most active coverage segment within that organization. So Nomura Green Tech was, or I guess still is, the largest energy transition sustainability oriented investment bank globally. And prior to that, I was at both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America in the energy and power group, and then spent the first third or so of my career actually doing project development initially in the water sector, but then broadening into a bit of conventional power and ministry as well. So do you think that experience working directly in development is valuable now when you're advising clients? Do you think that gives you a little bit of an insight that maybe some bankers who have only been on the investment banking side don't have? Absolutely. I've been told that repeatedly. It just gives a true appreciation of what many of our clients are going through, inherent understanding or better appreciation for the challenges, but also the ability to also better articulate their stories. That's very interesting. And speaking of challenges, it is certainly an interesting time to be in the energy transition. Obviously, we have a new administration that is probably changing a little bit about what people think of when they think of energy transition. I just have to ask, how has your job, how has your role changed since President Trump's election and since all the changes to energy policy that have gone along with that have started to come into effect? That's a great question. And I'd say absolutely a lot has changed, but both positive and negative. As you probably imagine, most of the talk and action really has been around tariffs, which not only impact energy transition, but also the broader economy. And the approach of the administration has introduced a significant amount of uncertainty for a wide spectrum of businesses, making strategic planning, supply chain management and other aspects really hard to predict and navigate. And what that's done is it's created probably a natural slowdown in M&A activity. And according to our M&A group, and I think you saw something in Reuters as well, saying that the year to date M&A activity has actually been the lowest that has been in over 20 years. But I would say overall, we continue to remain quite optimistic that there's going to be a robust M&A environment, which perhaps we'll talk about a bit separately or later on in this conversation. But with the tariffs, yeah, it has had an impact on businesses, introduces more uncertainty, especially around PPA pricing. But a clear positive for this sector has been the substantial amount of low growth coming mainly from AI and cloud computing. And this trend is not a result of the Trump administration per se, but one that's continued to gain momentum, become more and more tangible as people start to unearth partnerships and other ways to get power to these data centers that are going to be a critical part of the overall U.S. economy. And so with that, specifically with energy transition, say that with renewable energy really is the most viable and near term available solution at scale to meeting that demand that we have. And so therefore, it's a very favorable midterm, near to midterm environment for renewable energy just solely as a result of that. Yeah. When you talk about the shift over the last six months, it only tells part of the story. You really have to go 18 months back at least to look at the way that the AI revolution and the shifting changes around how we are looking at the power needs have really changed the industry. And I think last year there was maybe some debate within renewables, well, is this good or not? Because the idea of a transition where we phase out conventional power and replace it with renewables seemed a little bit outdated when you needed so much additional power. Now, as you mentioned, now that you have a new administration who wouldn't have been favorable to that philosophy in the first place, it does seem like it's a little bit of a saving grace because you need all this power and people in the renewables industry will say, hey, listen, you could forget about the fact that it's green if you want. The bottom line is we need this power with all this load growth coming on. We are the industry that is able to bring that power now and not five years, 10 years down the line as might be the case with gas and nuclear. I think, as you mentioned, it really does seem like the AI revolution is a little bit of a saving grace for renewable developers. Yeah, I completely agree. And look, we are going to see new natural gas, and honestly, we need more to ensure robust grid reliability. But in near term, I think a lot of that new natural gas is really going to come from some project expansions and retrofits. There are some projects that had already been in the queue and that are being built. But really, to build new natural gas at scale, it's going to take five to seven years for a new large project to come online, just considering the turbine lead times and also the construction time. So it's a very favorable environment for renewables from that perspective, which account for 95% of key positions. You mentioned the slowdown in M&A, you mentioned all the uncertainty at the same time you are still working with clients and trying to get deals done. How are you advising clients given this uncertain and kind of tumultuous environment? Yeah, it's a great question, too. And I'd say it continues to change by the day. But one overarching consistency is not to launch a capital raise or sale process with the current market backdrop, to wait until some of the dust settles. Because we are confident there's going to be a robust M&A environment and President Trump at his heart is a deal guy. And you look at some of the market's initial reaction when he took office, there was an expectation of really significant, if not record M&A. So I think that is still his plan, though, there's definitely some shakeups that he is implementing to get some of his policy initiatives across. But we're confident that there is going to be a robust backdrop once some of this uncertainty dies away. And, you know, we talked about the load growth and the favorability for renewables, absolutely. But even when you look at the macro picture, it still remains quite robust as well, though, obviously, there is some risk depending on how long the policy uncertainty persists. But GDP, productivity, unemployment all continue to be very strong, right? Inflation remains low. Debt markets have continued to be robust and there's over a trillion dollars of funding capital available for investment, which is still near record levels. So there's quite a bit of pent up demand when things settle. We tell our clients, you know, you want to be early, be ready to go when the window opens and the opportunity presents itself. But Derek, you talk about the tariffs and certainly those have presented challenges across the board. But when you zero in on renewables as an industry, there's also been a lot of seeming policy hostility that's specific to this industry. Even in the past week, you had the ADCVD duties that were ruled on that are going to make it a lot more expensive or difficult to import solar panels from Southeast Asia. And you had the Equinor project, the offshore wind project that was basically halted by an order from the Bureau of Ocean Management. There's a lot of concern that parts of the IRA could be gutted or could at least be affected in a tax reconciliation bill. I think you're right to say that overall, the economy is going to settle down when there's some predictability. But is there a threat that things could get worse for renewables in the latter part of this year? I would say there's always a possibility. But with those instances in particular that you mentioned, so ADCVD in Southeast Asia, that was largely expected. That level of scrutiny has existed for a while and companies had already started to modify their supply chains. It's also another data point for supporting domestic manufacturing, which most of the large panel manufacturers have already started to do and switch their businesses. So that is less of an overall impact. With Empire Wind, it would be interesting to see how this ultimately plays out. It's going to go to the courts and we'll see what the ultimate determination is. But it could raise a pretty significant, really material concern if a precedent does start to get set around policy changes, whether it's permitting, subsidies, et cetera, retroactively changing based off of an administration. And so while, yes, this does impact in particular Empire Wind and offshore wind, the implications can really reverberate through all segments of the economy. And so I'm confident that at the end of the day that the precedent will not get set, though it's obviously concerning. If you look at the Equinor case, it seems like that has implications potentially even beyond renewables. If the standard becomes that when there's a change in administration, if there's a controversial project, even that's kind of far along finance and everything, the new administration will or might pull the plug. I think that's going to have far reaching effects. So that's something we're following closely and it'll be interesting to see what happened there, as you mentioned. Now, you talked about a lot of the challenges and I think where there's uncertainty, there could also be opportunity. Are you seeing areas of opportunity in today's investment climate? Absolutely. And I would say there are a few specific areas, one, project development and potential acquisitions there. Right now, we've continued to see an increase in the cost and the timeline for project development pertaining to interconnect, etc. And I think what that could do, the longer this period of uncertainty that exists, is it could create some potential distress for some of the smaller or medium-sized, less well-capitalized companies must go and pursue monetization options. So I think you will see a lot of early, mid-stage projects starting to change hands in a capital-intensive industry. Also, you're going to see more of a shift to companies trying to raise capital through the sale of de-risked projects. And so what I would say by those, that's more under-construction and operating projects. So just as we were talking about with Equinor and Empire Wind, there is increasing uncertainty as to whether those projects are truly de-risked, but we are seeing a lot of activity where companies are looking to recycle capital from those de-risked events that will enable them to continue to grow and expand their business as we continue to have high interest rates and they want to raise more cost-effective capital to optimize their businesses. I think also in times like this, it's becoming evident that scale is extremely critical and creates significant strategic advantages. And so I think you will also start to see more consolidation of even companies in this space, developers, IPPs that own assets, I think you'll see a level of consolidation that starts to occur. And then in terms of specific industries or sub-sectors, I would say distributed generation. You're going to continue to see more and more activity there. There's a lot of increased investor interest that's starting in that space as it's driven more by state-level policies rather than federal. And they're also competing generally against retail rates rather than wholesale. And the projects, they're smaller and therefore quicker to build. And so it's easier to react to some of these market-based changes that we've talked about. And you've also got higher margins, higher profit margins, or developer fees. And so there's a better inherent ability to absorb changes. And the last factor I'd say on that industry as to why we see increased interest is that we're actually starting to see several companies that have proven their ability to scale. And that was something that many investors, including the largest ones, had really struggled to find. And they weren't sure. It raised a natural question for them as to whether it was even possible to create substantial scale or attractive scale and profitability in the sector. So there are multiple companies out there that fall in that category. We're definitely seeing a lot of interest and a lot of activity within distributed generation. You mentioned some of the advantages that it has in this market. Another thing is it's relatively quicker development time. So if you're looking at long-term uncertainty, I guess when you have projects that take a year or two years to build, then there's less that could go wrong, less that could change in that time than projects that might take three or four years. It's a little bit of a reversal from maybe the philosophy of the past, which would be, hey, we're going to sign a PPA at a certain price. And then by the time we're actually building the project a few years from now, our prices will have gone down significantly and that'll be our profit. It seems like that trend has reversed to the benefit now of DG. Yeah, I agree with that. Any other sectors that you think are relatively well-positioned to benefit from this environment? I would say the ones we talked about are the main ones now, onshore renewables, distributed generation, energy storage as well. I think some of the others you'd mentioned, the IRA, yeah, there is still some level of uncertainty as to what's going to happen with the IRA and some of the segments that are a bit more on the fringe, such as clean hydrogen, carbon capture, even while there is a lot of Republican support, there's still remain questionable in terms of just where things will shake out when budget reconciliation and the IRA ultimately gets finalized. Yeah, I think that definitely is still one of the main concerns that's hanging over the industry. So we've talked a lot about the challenges and the restrictions and how it is slowing down the M&A market, but Derek, how are deals getting done now? How are deals getting done in this environment? Yeah, I mean, deals are absolutely still getting done. There have been a number of transactions that are just taking a bit longer as people try to navigate a lot of this uncertainty, but there is still a lot of conviction around the market, the fundamental trends and outlook for renewables and energy transition. And therefore, companies are still making large M&A or large acquisitions. And you can point to Brookfield acquiring National Grid Renewables as one of those. Obviously, Brookfield's an experienced renewables investor. And they did have that long-term conviction. And the National Grid platform was differentiated. And so therefore, there was good investor interest, and that was a $1.7 billion check. So we're still seeing transactions get done for sure, but there has been a general slowdown. But when you get to the question of how, I mean, are there contingencies being put in for policy changes? Is there risk shifting? Is anything like that going on? Yeah, there is to some extent. You'll see some burnout-oriented structures. You will see some change of law risk, especially around project-level M&A transactions. And so, yes, there has been an increased occurrence of those types of caveats. Well, very interesting. And Derek, you said that you think that the M&A market will pick up. I certainly hope for your right. I hope that we have plenty to write about in the latter part of this year, and you have plenty to work on. So let's hope you're right about that prediction. Yeah, we're pretty confident in it for sure. But I appreciate that, Andrew. You guys do a great job. Well, thank you. I really appreciate it, Derek. And thank you again for joining the program.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Today on Crossroads, we have Robert Shaw, Managing Director of CBRE Investment Management's Private Infrastructure Strategy. Robert, thank you for coming on the podcast. Great. Well, thank you very much for having me. I think our listeners, I'm sure, are familiar with CBRE, but perhaps more so for the firm's real estate practice. How long has CBRE been active in infrastructure as well? People are obviously familiar with the four letters from their neighborhoods and by their offices. I mean, CBRE is the largest real asset services business in the world, leading practices and brokerage, facilities management, project management. One of the real key pillars of CBRE is CBRE Investment Management, which is approximately about $150 billion real asset manager focusing on both real estate and infrastructure. Our infrastructure team joined CBRE-IM in 2017 in an effort to really transition the platform from solely real estate to more of a real assets focus, really focusing in on the global mid-market. We see a lot of exciting opportunities between the infrastructure and real estate, really at the intersection of those two asset classes. And we've been really excited to join forces and begin to execute on those opportunities. And Rob, were you there from the beginning? Did you join in 2017 when that was launched or did you come on a little bit later? Yeah, I joined at that time. CBRE bought an existing business, Calvin Capital Management. So the team joined in with CBRE Investment Management then and it's been a really successful partnership. And what was your background before joining the firm? Yeah. So prior to joining the firm, I worked at Tories in their private M&A practice group, really working for infrastructure funds, infrastructure focused pension plans and acquiring infrastructure assets. So I was a service provider and then moved over and became an investor and I've really enjoyed that part of the journey. So you've been an infrastructure man your whole career? Yes. And I feel the law background is helpful. I mean, obviously infrastructure is very contract driven. We really focused at our shop on having really strong contracted revenues. And so having that legal background, I think, is helpful in that respect. Well, it's interesting. Last time I was at CBRE's offices in February, the message I heard both from yourself and from some of your colleagues was that this moment seemed to be purpose built for infrastructure. Now, I know two months kind of feels like an eternity in the current environment, but is that still the case? And if so, why is that the sentiment? It's still the case. Obviously, we're moving a mile a minute in the news cycle these days, but I think if you look back in the last five to 10 years, we had COVID, inflation, high interest rates and infrastructure returns really remain resilient. Now we're facing tariffs, global trade headwinds. Again, we think strong contracted infrastructure projects that really demonstrate core qualities of downside protection, stable income, inflation protection are really a benefit to investors' portfolios. In addition to really protecting the downside, which is a core focus of ours, you really get the benefit of these large megatrends of digitalization and decarbonization that really extend beyond any particular government or administration. Now, another thing you mentioned is that CBRE looks for relative value when it comes to asset class. Avoiding areas where you, what you described as irrational exuberance and finding places that perhaps there are better relative opportunities. So at the moment, where do you see these opportunities? Yeah, I mean, infrastructure is not unique as an asset class when an investment approach like so much of investing is driven by cycles and capital flows. So if you look at our fund and how it has developed over time, I mean, we were early movers in the digital infrastructure space when it was really kind of an underappreciated asset. That's become more widely an infrastructure asset and really become an investment that people want to have strong exposure to. And we've really seen run up in valuations in that space. If you compare that against energy transition investments, which really in sort of, you know, 2019, 2020, 2021, when people were really piling in and there was a lot of funds coming, ESG related funds, sustainability related funds moving into that space, that really compressed valuations. And so we shied away from investing. As we've seen that area develop, obviously there's been challenges from interest rates or some headwinds politically for clean energy. And so we've seen those valuations and the capital flows into those specific strategies pulled back. And so we're seeing some great buying opportunities there. And so one of the benefits we really see is of managing an open end fund is really being able to be strategic with their allocations and really focusing on the best risk adjusted returns. And then in terms of size, Seabury is really focused in the mid market and at a time where a lot of firms are raising these mega funds. Why do you think that's the right strategy? And do you see advantages there? I really think a lot is driven by capital flows. So you've seen recently in the infrastructure market, just a ton of capital getting concentrated in these large mega funds. And that's really distorting the infrastructure market. So you have a lot of capital up in the large cap space, but very few assets. And then in the mid cap space, you see not as much capital, but a lot of assets. And that's really creating buying opportunities in the mid cap space and selling opportunities in large cap space. I think those trends are really accelerated by what we're seeing in mid market closed end funds, where it's a buyer's market right now. People are having challenges exiting their investments and having challenges raising their next funds. And so that's also creating a buying opportunity in the mid market. And so what we see is a really compelling opportunity for investors is to buy in the mid market, build strong platform companies, grow them and seek to move them up into the large cap where we really think you get multiple expansion given the scarcity of quality assets up in that space. So do you think as an investor, there's perhaps less competition for some of these mid cap investments? Yeah, that's right. I think that's what we've been seeing the past few years now. We've been seeing this dynamic play out where there's more and more buying opportunities. There's more opportunities to get things on a bilateral basis. So we're not dealing with competition or auction processes on different investments. And when you get those opportunities, I think you're able to cut yourself a better deal. You're able to get better alignment with the management team, which is hugely important when you're in the mid market space, because you really want to be backing strong teams that have the ability to maintain their existing businesses, but really to grow their businesses with really quality contracted CapEx that can drive really strong, stable returns for investors. Can you give any examples of the type of investment you're describing where you were able to buy it at the mid market and then turn it into a large cap type investment? Yeah, I mean, we've done it in a couple of different circumstances. We were an early mover, early investor in the data center space. We invested into a portfolio company, Data Bank, back in 2016 when it had six data centers and three markets. I mean, that's now up to about 28 markets, 70 data centers. And we've seen really the multiples of that business really expand. We bought in the low teens and then it's recently been valued up in the high 20s. So you really get to see that strong multiple expansion as you move from the mid market and execute and bring it into the large cap. We've also had a really strong experience with Accelerate, which is the land under infrastructure platform company that we established. And we've been successfully aggregating infrastructure sites in that business. And it's now up to about half a billion dollars of invested capital. And we think as we continue to grow that, move it into large cap space, we'll get really the same benefit that Data Bank has of really getting both a growth of the EBITDA and also a growth of the EBITDA multiple, which will really benefit our investors. And what about your relationship with your LPs? You describe how you think there's investment opportunities are better in mid cap, but are LPs open to that also? Or a lot of them want to be in some of these kind of super mega funds? Yeah, I think when people are looking at their allocations to infrastructure, and I think I might be a bit colored being a Canadian and obviously early movers in the infrastructure space and the pension plans in Canada have really been leaders in infrastructure. When we look at other markets, I mean, primarily the US LP market, there's an underweight to infrastructure. And typically, when you're making a first allocation, there's some comfort in going with one of the large mega cap funds. And so we often see people will get their really core infrastructure exposure through those mega cap funds, and then look to augment their portfolios with a really quality mid market fund that can provide both cash yield that you can see in a core fund, but also the potential for growth and for multiple expansion as I've been talking about so far on the podcast. Well, very interesting. I want to go back to something you discussed earlier. You said that when it comes to the energy transition, you're seeing opportunities there. Now, obviously, it's to be expected that some folks are pulling back because of the uncertainty. But there really are a lot of challenges up ahead. You have the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, which has been put on hold, but who knows for how long. And then you have possible changes to the IRA that have been contemplated, along with just executive orders that have made the playing field not as favorable for the renewable kinds of investments. So how do you navigate that? And how do you invest in that climate? Yeah, this is a really fundamental and key question. We view the decarbonization infrastructure trend as a mega trend that is not beholden to a particular administration. If you look at what the current administration wants to achieve, they want to bring back onshore US manufacturing. They want to be a leader in AI supercomputing. There's no way that they can accomplish those goals without sustainable electricity generation and storage. We're not going to build nuclear in the next four years. We're not going to build natural gas power plants in the next four years. The only possible source that's going to be able to fulfill the power demand is renewable generation and storage. There might be movements on the edge on the IRA. There have been US Republican senators and congressmen who have come out against that and in support of the IRA. And even look at the first Trump administration. The ITCs were in existence there and there were about 19 gigawatts of solar and 30 gigawatts of wind were built during his first administration. I think you need to look past the noise and the headlines and really view the fundamental drivers of this infrastructure demand. And I think when you do that, you see that it's inevitable. We're going to have to continue to build renewable generation and storage. And we just need to be very intelligent by the way that we're playing the space. And as mentioned before, we think there's better relative value in this space now. And I think where we're really focused on is operating assets. And those operating assets, you know, you de-risk it from a tariff perspective. You de-risk it from an IRA perspective because both of those things happened during construction. We think there's an opportunity to buy those assets. And we think operating assets will do very well in this situation where they do put in tariffs and they do cut the IRA because that's going to increase the cost of building new assets. And if you still have strong power demand, the only variable that can move is power prices. And so we're spending a lot of time looking into that space. What do you talk about relative value? Is that there for operating assets in this environment? Because I feel like to a degree people are really pulling back on how they value a development pipeline, which maybe relatively puts operating assets at a premium. Or are there some folks who are saying we don't want to touch renewables at all? Yeah, you're right that the hardest hit part of the evaluations has really been development pipelines. We don't see a lot of value being placed in growth pipelines right now. But I still think given the pullback of capital from the mid market space and the pullback of capital from of sustainability capital in the US, that's creating buying opportunities for operating projects. There's projects right now, especially that have come through their tax equity phase, where people are looking to sell those assets and reinvest money in other parts of their portfolios. And I think that's created a lot of volume of operating assets being put out to the market. And again, there isn't that strong support of capital waiting to buy them up. So we're seeing some failed processes. And we're seeing opportunities where you can get these assets at a fairly good valuation. Very interesting. And when you're talking about operating assets, are you looking primarily at core renewables, wind, solar, batteries? Are there any other energy asset classes that are appealing to you? That's where we spend the majority of our time in those three categories. We're looking at the future of energy infrastructure. It's going to be more, but it's going to be more of those three. The supply chains are built out absent potential tariff risks. The technology is proven. The contracting, particularly for solar and wind, was well tested. I think batteries still have some wood to chop on getting really strong contractual offtake. And we think that will continue to develop as more and more batteries come onto the grid. But I think those three, energy generation and storage technologies, are really the backbone of how we're going to fulfill the demand that's coming onto the grid from data centers, from electrification of transportation, from electrification of buildings. I think those three are going to be the prime drivers of meeting that demand. You mentioned the electrification of buildings. You mentioned powering data centers. And I think you bring up an interesting point that I know CBRE has said before, which is that it's hard to separate energy from these other asset classes. Are you finding that to be the case? Completely. And we actually spend a lot of time with our colleagues on the real estate side really discussing power. If you look at a logistics facility now, like say 10 years ago, you're building a new logistics warehouse, you weren't concerned whether you could get sufficient power to build your facility. Now that's the number one issue. And so we see these two asset classes converging. In order to build new high-tech logistics facilities that have automation in them, you're going to need to have power. And given where the utilities are and the constraints in the areas where these warehouses are, that really means you're going to need to bring your own power. And so we see more and more instances of people looking at microgrid solutions, people looking at rooftop solar, people looking at battery storage, backup, resilient gen sets. We think that's going to be a larger and larger discussion from real estate owners. We already see that right now for data centers, like that's clear, but I think it's going to be coming out to more and more different parts of the real estate market. And how do you work with some of the other strategies to find synergies in your investments? Yeah, that's a huge part of our strategy is really to working with the broader CBRE platform. I think it's a unique differentiator for our business. It allows us to do two things. One, we can get more bilateral deals with management teams because they want to have access to the broader CBRE platform. And two, it helps us create value for our portfolio companies. Great example, we have a heavy-duty EV charging business called Forum Mobility that operates at the ports of Long Beach, LA, Oakland, and California. One of the ways that we really work together with them is we have a logistics fund. So we own properties right around the ports, and we're working on co-locating charging onto our own properties. And then CBRE has the largest brokerage business for port-adjacent real estate, and so working to identify depots with our brokerage colleagues. So we really try to map out the different areas of CBRE that we can be helpful to our companies. And we really focus our investments in areas where we think there's real synergies between our infrastructure investment and the broader CBRE platform. Yeah, it does seem like now more than ever with power being such a key to unlocking everything, it does seem like that would be more of a factor than ever before, than even a few years ago. Now outside of energy and renewables and the energy transition, what infrastructure sectors do you find intriguing and do you find relative value at the moment? The other area of infrastructure that we've been spending a lot of time in is really building decarbonization. So we just completed at the end of last year an investment in Finland that was doing ground source heat pumps, really acting as essentially a utility of the building, providing heating and cooling services under long-term contracts. And again, this is an area where we think we're uniquely positioned to win with the broader CBRE platform. Geonova is the business and they're working with both CBRE-IM and the assets that they own, CBRE Global Workplace Solutions, our facilities management business, to really drive more origination and install more heat pumps, ground source heat pumps into buildings. And we think this is a really important area to be active in because as renewable energy becomes a larger part of the grids and we start to electrify transportation assets, the last area where we're having a lot of fossil fuel use is really in buildings, natural gas boilers, natural gas furnaces. And we think there will be strong demand from customers and also strong push from governments to help to clean up and make sure that we have more sustainable electrified sources of heating and cooling in buildings. And we think that's going to be a real strong driver for infrastructure capital over the next 10 years. Yeah, that's definitely something we're hearing more about. I guess the challenge there is taking that and creating an investable infrastructure opportunity. How do you go about that? Yeah, scale is the main challenge. When you put in a ground source heat pump, they're relatively low-touch infrastructure assets. They have long-term contracts. As mentioned, you're essentially the utility. But the challenge is how do you aggregate enough of those up in order to have a sufficiently scaled platform? And I think that's one of the areas that we excel at in our fund, focusing on the mid-market, focusing on leveraging the broader CBRE platform to drive origination, to help build those platform companies into really strong infrastructure assets that we can hopefully move up into that large cap space and create really nice platforms that either our investors can continue to get the benefit of those cash flows or we can take advantage of the multiple expansion as we move from the mid-market to the large cap space. Now, I think we're just about out of time. But before we go, I'm curious. You've been in infrastructure your whole career. Looking forward now, what sectors or what asset classes or what types of investments do you think we're going to be talking about five years from now that aren't really on anybody's radar or at least aren't investable in 2025? We've talked about a few of them. It's not that they're not investable right now, but I think they are just subscale or not fully developed. So I think in the next five years, what you're going to see is really there's going to be more investment into building decarbonization, so ground source heat pumps, energy efficiency, building retrofits. I think that's going to become a larger part of the infrastructure space. I think we're going to see more in electrification of transportation. I think that's an earlier stage infrastructure asset right now that really needs to be matured and built out as basically the supply chains of OEMs from the fleet side catch up to where they are at the commercial vehicle side. And then we also talked about batteries. I think that's going to be a big part of the next five years. There's a lot of batteries right now in the queue in the utility queues to come online, but they're not quite yet at the stage like solar and wind is from a contracting basis. And so a lot of them now are focused on merchant revenue. So energy arbitrage through the day, some capacity contracts from the utility. I think we're going to see real developments in the contracting side of batteries, which makes them a more core infrastructure asset class. Well, very interesting. We'll have to have you back on in five years to see how much of this turned out to be correct. Awesome. We're happy to do it. Hopefully I'm right. Rob, thank you so much for joining the podcast. It was great having you on. Really appreciate it. Thank you for the time. And thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-11 15:54:27+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Hari Rajan of Investcorp Corsair sees new investment opportunities\n**Episode ID:** 4419\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello, and welcome to another edition of InfraLogic's Crossroads podcast. I'm your host, Gene Gilligan, Senior Reporter at InfraLogic. My guest today is Hari Rajan, Managing Partner at Investcore Corsair. Hari, welcome to the podcast. Lady can join us. Morning, Gene. It's great to be speaking with you. Thank you so much. First of all, please give us some background on Investcorp Corsair. Absolutely. Investcorp Corsair is a $5 billion infrastructure equity sponsor that is a partnership between two large private market asset management firms, Corsair Capital, based in New York, and Investcorp in the Middle East. We focus on the transportation and logistics sector, which I would define most simply as investing in assets that are critical to the safe and efficient movement of people and goods around the world. We invest across three broad categories that generally track the three key modes of transportation, air, sea, and surface. Our mandate is global, but we're probably best known here in the U.S. for our investments in the airport space, in particular, our lead financial sponsorship and operational management of two high-profile and landmark airport privatization redevelopments, LaGuardia Terminal B and JFK Terminal 6, both here in New York. Tell us about your background, if you would. Sure. I've been in private markets investing for over 25 years. I started with Corsair and was a partner in our buyouts business focused on financial and business services, and then I helped set up our infrastructure business in 2015, which I have been leading since. First question I have is, and we're certainly seeing a lot of headlines in various sectors and the economic outlook here, what is your macroeconomic outlook for the three sectors that you are invested in, airports, ports, logistics, and highways? We believe that transportation and logistics broadly is a large investing universe that in the coming years will generate some of the most attractive risk return propositions in the infrastructure space and perhaps across private markets more generally. The overarching macro theme and driving force behind that opportunity set is a significant under-allocation of capital to transportation and logistics over the past years and decades. That's resulted in a multi-trillion dollar shortfall in funding for both new construction and the maintenance of existing but severely aging assets. Now, given fiscal pressures around the world, much of this capital will need to come from private sources in partnership with the public sector. This is a condition that is most powerfully evident here in the U.S. where we are in the early stages of a much-anticipated and truly historic program of refurbishing and revitalizing our domestic transportation networks, and that's where our business has established a market-leading position with some significant first-mover advantages. Are there any trends out there that you're seeing that you believe could have a material impact on these sectors? Sure. The investment strategy in each of our verticals is distinctly in the value-add segment of the infrastructure investing spectrum. So what that means is that we don't invest in mature assets with business-as-usual operations where transactions are really based predominantly on who has the lowest cost of capital. Rather, in all of our investments, we require there to be a significant component of sponsor-led value creation. So that could be a new construction project, a major CapEx program, a significant shift in pricing or revenue models, maybe the reworking of a long-term financing or capital structure. It could also include initiatives related to two key themes or trends in transport infrastructure that we're seeing today. First, automation and digitization, which is applying new technologies and processes to replace outdated manual forms of interaction between infrastructure assets and their users. And second, energy transition, which is upgrading heavy energy-consuming transport infrastructure to be more efficient, to leverage alternative energy sources, and generally contribute meaningfully to the decarbonization agenda. Very good. We did speak about these trends when we spoke a while ago, and you're still seeing opportunities in these areas. Absolutely. Increasing, maybe even more so. Increasing and intensifying. And I know you're very invested in airport terminals, and as a New Yorker, I've seen the work going on at JFK, and very exciting, looking forward to that opening. What amenities are kind of must-haves in the airport terminals of today? What are fliers and passengers looking for in these modernized terminals? We believe that in order to be a successful long-term investor in the airport space, you absolutely need to be able to continually identify, design, develop, and implement new features and service offerings. And that requires a high level of operational skill and knowledge, as well as the ability to implement these changes in airport facilities that you are actually managing on a day-to-day basis, and drive a vision for what airport infrastructure will look like in the future. And I appreciate your mentioning our work here in New York on both LaGuardia and JFK. We're really able to do this through our platform company, Vantage Group, which is one of the key pillars of our investment franchise. You know, Vantage is a leading independent airport developer and operator with 25 years of experience across over 30 airports. We own 100% of Vantage, and it's our dedicated platform for airport-related investments. And it plays a critical role in evaluating projects from a deep operational perspective, which with much greater clarity and precision around key value creation levers. And that's the model that allowed us to win both LaGuardia and JFK, each of which is a $5 billion project in which we're the controlling shareholder with our platform company, Vantage, as the operator. Now, Vantage deploys significant time and resources into thinking about the future of airports and what types of services, amenities, and functions need to be developed. You know, there's some pretty interesting kind of futuristic stuff like supersonic travel, which is a current theme that we're monitoring. But in terms of where the greatest focus is right now, it's really thinking about how to enhance the customer experience as a passenger travels through an airport terminal from the curb to the jet bridge and vice versa on arrival through processes like check-in, security screening, the food, beverage, and retail areas. So all kind of how do we use new technologies and product offerings to make that just a better experience for the ultimate constituent, which is the traveling public. And it's really hard to invest in those themes if you're not the incumbent operator of a sufficiently large network of airports in which to trial and test these things out. And that's exactly the type of competitive advantage that we get through Vantage and that we're applying in all of our airport work, which, of course, includes JFK and LaGuardia, as we talked about, very high profile and very visible, particularly here in our New York community. But we also do a lot on the commercial retail side in places like Kansas City and Chicago Midway. So even smaller airports, do you see opportunities there, you know, even in smaller cities? We do. The underinvestment in airport infrastructure in the U.S. is across the board. It's certainly most perceptible and severe in our very large kind of gateway and hub airports, which is where a lot of this work is starting. But I think increasingly, local communities will recognize that improving the quality of their offerings related to transport infrastructure and particularly air travel is an absolute imperative and can be accomplished through partnership with the private sector. And also, you are very invested in the port and logistics sector. So we've been hearing certainly a lot about tariffs and that are maybe upcoming and already been instituted by the U.S. and, you know, other countries that are kind of retaliating. Any thoughts on what effect these tariffs might have on ports and logistics? We're obviously in a very fast-moving environment as it relates to U.S. tariff policy. In fact, I think we're recording this probably just a few hours before we're going to get a major announcement from the administration. So clearly, we are taking and will be taking a cautious approach as it relates to infrastructure assets whose revenues are directly correlated to cross-border trade between the United States and its trading partners around the world. That said, a very large portion of our investment opportunity set in the U.S. relates to assets that support domestic passenger travel and domestic movement of goods. You know, the need to refurbish and revitalize our domestic transportation networks and the severe underinvestment they have experienced over the past years and decades, and the need for private capital to play a major role in that, that's not something that's going to change as a result of tariff policy. So our strategy in that regard remains very much intact and the opportunity set remains very much in place. Now, outside of the United States, you know, we are invested and will continue to invest in assets that support trade between countries and regions. For example, our Australian ports, which are origin and destination facilities for the import of containerized goods from Asia, that type of trade may well intensify as a result of U.S. tariff policy. And, you know, we could certainly be the beneficiaries of that. Very interesting. So it might be win-lose and win-win in some situations, right? Yeah. Gene, are there any sectors or geographies that InvestCorps Corsair is planning to target for acquisitions? Yeah, Gene, you know, I mentioned that our investment activity tracks the three key modes of transportation, air, sea, and surface. To provide a bit more detail on that, air transport infrastructure centers, of course, around passenger and cargo airports and airport terminals, but it also includes a full range of businesses that provide essential products and services to the complex airport ecosystem from baggage handling to off-airport parking to various types of in-airport commercial and retail offerings. Seaborn infrastructure comprises all of the assets that make up the shipping supply chain, and that's anchored certainly by container ports and other types of port terminals that we talked about. But it also includes various land side logistics, warehousing and transport operations that contribute to the movement of Seaborn cargo from supplier to ultimate owner. And then finally, on the surface transport side, that includes everything you would imagine roads, bridges, tunnels, but also everything rail related from tracks and switching equipment to rail stations, as well as ancillary services and functions like roadside EV charging, service stations, and transponder and tolling technology. With respect to rail specifically, that's a significant opportunity in the United States with massive amounts of deferred maintenance and unrealized opportunities, including in areas like high-speed rail. And we've already made significant headway in that space through our Vantage platform, where we have branched beyond airports and operate the concession program at 30th Street Rail Station in Philadelphia in partnership with Amtrak. So it's really a combination of investing in large scale facilities that define these transport ecosystems, as well as investments in smaller companies that service those ecosystems with unique products. Very good. There's certainly a lot to be watching in the transport sector and logistics sector as we move forward in the next year or so, and I will certainly be watching.

I'm Matt O'Brien, Reporter and Deputy Managing Editor for Infralogix North American News Coverage and I'll be your host today. Gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest, someone who's going to give us a close look at the stabilized data center marketplace, certain capital allocators who have been noticeably absent from recent data center dealmaking, enterprise adoption of AI, the IPO market. If we have some time, a little bit more, I have with me Managing Director and Head of Data Center Banking for Goldman Sachs, Alex Tangle. Welcome to the show, Alex. Thanks a lot for having me. I appreciate it, Matt. All right. I've been looking forward to this one. I want to start off the conversation with taking a look at the stabilized data center marketplace. It's something we at Infralogix have been tracking for some time now, whether it's yield codes or it's a discussion of capital recycling, stable codes. The context is varied. So I want us to start there. We've seen several processes come to market, but few have been executed on. Can you give me your take on this particular corner, the data center sector? Sure. Well, this is probably, if I think about strategic topics that we're spending time on with our clients, both the sponsors that have invested in data center platforms and then the management teams that run these companies, probably consuming about 50% of the airtime or mind share of our client dialogue. And I think that's reflective of everybody trying to figure out what the both near-term and long-term solution is going to be to this stabilized data center conundrum that the industry is facing. So if you rewind a little bit and think about the wave of capital deployment that's taken place in data centers over the past few years, there have been tens of billions, if not north of a hundred billion of equity that we think has gone to work in various data center platforms, the vast majority of which has gone to support the development of new data centers. Probably not surprising for folks to hear, given the pace of build out happening across the industry. As this capital was invested into these companies, the assumption was that there is going to need to be some long-term solution for what's going to happen to these data centers once they've been built physically, they've gone vertical, the tenant is inside, the facility's cash flowing. The question that all these investors have faced is who's going to be the long-term owner of these data centers on a sort of go-forward basis. When development capital came into these businesses, I actually think the underwrite was typically accompanied by a view that there's probably going to be multiple paths to monetizing stabilized data centers. I think a lot of the investors that put money into these platforms recognized that the businesses may be getting to be too large for your traditional private equity style standalone exit where you just sell the whole thing at once. There's been an assumption that there's going to be multiple potential off-takers for these stabilized assets, ranging from yield codes, which you mentioned, and we'll come back to broader stable codes, potential to take some of these businesses or sections of the businesses public, which is another topic I want to touch on, and other solutions beyond that. What you suggested that there've been platforms that have come to market for these stabilized trades, but there've been few that have materialized to date, I'd almost tweak that a little bit by saying I think there's been a lot of platforms that have thought of bringing certain stabilized assets to market or have perhaps soft-tested the market to see what the interest level has been, but have ultimately held back from going and launching full-fledged processes around their stabilized assets, in part because there hasn't yet been a huge imperative to go and recycle capital yet because there's continued to be enough growth capital available to support development. In other words, let's just say you're one of these companies, you're looking at your forward pipeline, and you say, I'm going to need several billion of new development capital to put to work. How do I go and fund that? Well, to date, we continue to have pretty efficient construction and project finance markets that fund the build out of this. We have sponsors that still, in many cases, have incremental capital that they're able to deploy, and also large LP relationships for other investors who can invest directly and want to put more money to work towards development. Everyone is sitting there recognizing, hey, I know I need to deal with the stabilized data center issue at some point, but I don't necessarily need to do it today. I don't know if I'm going to be able to reach a meeting of the minds with potential buyers for these stabilized assets on valuation today. Since I have access to this other money, both debt and equity, to fund ongoing development, let me just hold on to the assets that I've developed and that have stabilized, and let me kick the can down the road a little bit. I think it's generally a characterization of what's happened. The transactions that have happened to date, they have not been giant holistic solutions. They've been either one-off trades or trades that have been perhaps the start of a yield co. Not to suggest that they haven't been good trades that have gotten done, but I think they've represented, on average, a pretty small percentage of developers' overall portfolios. The question is, for those that have set up these captive yield co. so far, or have found investors to come in and buy their stabilized data center assets, is the format of the transaction that has been done so far representative of what we're going to see happen in the next 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now? Or were those sort of like a good teaser, but these companies are going to need to figure out solutions that look a little bit different? One of the dilemmas that I think the industry has faced is that a lot of the assets that have been developed thus far were developed at a time when interest rates were lower, and thus the development yields that were commanded by developers were a little bit tighter back then than what developers are building turnkey and PowerGel data centers to today. Using illustrative numbers for a second, let's just say somebody built a turnkey data center project to a 7% unlevered yield on cost in a lower rate environment. Perhaps today that same project would be built to an 8.5% or 9%, but because it was built to a 7%, when you have buyers for the stabilized assets coming in and saying, I can pay a 6.25% or 6.5% cap rate for that asset, if you went and put capital to work developing that at a 7% yield, now a 6.25%, 6.5% exit cap rate maybe doesn't look all that exciting. I think to people that are going and building nowadays at wider yields on cost to that, and we've obviously remained in a rate environment where rates have kind of stayed higher for longer, I actually think the dynamics between buyer and seller will evolve over time, where owners of these developed assets will recognize that they probably need to find a home, and they can't hold onto them forever. So I think there's been some bid-ask spread in what sellers and buyers are looking to pay for these assets. And then the other thing I would say, and maybe a good segue to talking about just investors more broadly in this industry, there are large pockets of capital that have talked a lot about being interested in playing data centers, but have yet to really do so at scale. And we think that the stabilized asset trade is going to be one of the ways that they're going to do that. So the pools of capital that I would point out, one would be insurance money. There are a few large insurance aggregators that exist out there that have lots and lots of money to deploy and would tell you that they're looking to deploy not just billions, but potentially tens of billions of dollars in the sector against some opportunities. You have large core funds that by and large have also not played in the space yet, but are looking to play. And behind, by the way, those insurance aggregators and then the core funds are the respective like underlying investors that invest in those guys, several of whom are also able to do direct deals themselves. And then there's this whole pool of retail money that exists as well, that's maybe a little bit more nascent in the conversation topic versus insurance money and core fund money, but large pockets of retail money that when we think about coming up with a stabilized systematic way of monetizing assets really programmatically as they stabilize, that we think is going to be really important. So these are three pockets of capital that we haven't seen noticeably play in the sector to date because so much of the capital has been invested by infrafunds and their respective LPs, to a lesser extent, real estate funds and their respective LPs with a lot of this other money sort of still on the sidelines waiting to figure out their trade. Okay, great. Yeah. A few months ago, I would say the late fall, maybe mid fall, we came out with a piece on the pricing of Yolkos, right? And the hyperscale properties were around 6%, maybe high fives, enterprise, seven, eight. Can you say, has that moved at all in the last few months, or is that still somewhat what you're seeing? I think that's still somewhat what I'm seeing. I think, first of all, it takes a certain number of trades to actually happen to say, ah, okay, here are like other data points in the market to suggest what these can trade for. Either have been several hyperscale trades that have happened with five caps on them. Some of them have had sort of idiosyncratic elements to them where there've been either leases coming up for renewal, or we know that there's going to be a step up in the pricing of the lease and some other bells and whistles on them. But there haven't really been large scale stabilized trades that have happened in the past few months to suggest that that market has moved. I think what there are, again, are a bunch of developers that are sitting on several billion dollars worth of stabilized assets that are all sort of thinking, do I do something this year with this? Do I wait until next year? Is there a buyer at a price point that's going to make sense? So there's the price dynamic I've talked about. And then there's also the structural dynamic of if we've done so far some of these captive yield codes that have been generally on the smaller side, is an expanded format of that the right way to go about this? Or is there a bigger, more diversified way that we can actually go about this opportunity? Because the other dynamic at play is that historically some of these yield codes that have been done have largely bought assets that are call it 20, 30, 40 megawatt data centers, which at one time were quite sizable. But now as we know, there are data center campuses being built that are several hundred megawatts in size. Even if you are a massive LP capable of writing billions of dollars into stabilized data centers, when you think about the asset value that underlies like a 200 or 300 megawatt campus, you're talking about a massive, massive investment in a single facility. And to the extent that that's a campus that has a single tenant inside of it, you're asking an LP to go and buy that facility in its entirety. And even with a fair bit of debt in the cap structure is still a multi-billion dollar equity check potentially. And that's just a lot of concentrated exposure to have to one facility or one campus with one underlying hyperscaler in one market. I think most LPs who tell you, I really want to figure out a way to play the stabilized data center trade will tell you, one, I'm generally focused on markets that are really high quality markets, but two, I'm focused on getting some diversification of tenant themselves, even within hyperscale tenants, diversification of the hyperscaler underlying it, diversification of that lease term that's remaining, diversification of market. And so if I'm going to be an investor that is going to take a sort of portfolio perspective to how I'm invested in stabilized data centers, going and putting money into a project that basically just gets me exposure to one facility is an awfully concentrated way to do it versus saying, well, what about putting money into a fund or a fund-like vehicle of some kind that could actually get me exposure in a diversified way to the industry? So if you ask me to take a crystal ball and say, what do I think we're going to be in one year from now, sort of who are going to be the buyers for these stabilized data centers? I think you're likely to see a few different funds or fund-like vehicles out there that have raised several billion of equity capital and have a mandate to go buy stabilized data centers from a diverse array of operators and developers so that the underlying investors and those funds can get exposure in a diversified fashion. Those big dedicated stabilized data center funds that several GPs are either talking about or in the process of raising, you haven't really seen get done to date, but I think it's going to be one of the buyers for these stabilized assets that we'll see exist a year from now. Fascinating. Thanks for that thorough explanation. I could keep going on that topic for the sake of time. I don't think we're going to have time. So let me go on to my next question here. We've been following a couple of situations where day center sponsors are looking at the public equity markets as their natural exit, given some of these companies are so large. I can't see it being sold wholesale to another fund because the equity check that would need to be written is just, I guess it would be challenging. I guess it could be done, probably be challenging. So some are looking to the IPO market, public equity markets. What's your take there? What can we expect to see? My take is that it makes total sense that if you're the owner of one of these large platforms that you're naturally looking at the IPO market as a potential path. You look at the public equity markets right now for data centers. In the U.S. we have Equinix and Digital Realty as the two big publicly traded companies. Outside of the U.S. there are some other listed companies, but there's not been a scaled data center IPO that's taken place in the U.S. in quite some time. You had the wave of take privates that happened a few years ago where QTS, CyrusOne, and Switch were all taken private and then CoreSight was bought by American Tower. And that basically took out of the market a number of data center REITs and non-REITs that investors had exposure to. So it makes sense that people say, hey, this is a hot sector right now. There's a lot of investor appetite. Public markets are deep. Why don't we go and take a look at this opportunity? It is something that we're spending a lot of time on. And I think it is fair to assume that a number of these owners of these assets are thinking about it. But there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered about how to best get one of these IPOs done. One of them is that these businesses, as you point out, are just quite large. Public equity markets are able to swallow and absorb bigger businesses than a single sponsor could buy in a sort of sponsor-to-sponsor trade, as you rightly point out. But size considerations are still meaningful when you're talking about IPOs that could be sized in the several-billion-dollar range to begin with. The other thing I'd say is, think about those two companies I mentioned, Equinix and Digital Realty, that are the two public names in the space today. Both great businesses, but both very different business models at their core than some of the businesses that are privately owned that would look to go public. So if you think about most of these platforms that are privately owned, one, they are predominantly going after the hyperscale opportunity, which means they're deploying massive amounts of capital very quickly and signing up leases in what translates to P&Ls that are actually pretty lumpy in nature, where one day you may have $500 million of EBITDA, let's just say, and then you go and sign up another lease, and that lease jumps your run rate EBITDA from $500 million to $700 million overnight. Then you're looking at the next quarter, and you say, well, I have another lease I might sign. That lease is going to go to $900 million, but depending on the size of the lease that gets signed, that could actually be $1.1 billion, and maybe it'll get pushed out another quarter. That's unlike the vast majority of public companies that are listed. If you think about the job of a public company, the CFO and his or her team, you think about the concept of providing guidance to investors, managing forward forecasting and FP&A on a go-forward basis, things that public investors and research analysts are used to seeing. These businesses, as fast-growing as they are, they're super lumpy, and they're also super capital-consumptive. Investors want exposure to the space, but I think the question is, how do we take these businesses public in a way that we can actually manage pretty chunky stories like that to investors in a way that still work in the public markets and that don't make us feel like every quarter we're sweating bullets over the timing of getting a lease signed, which is just a tricky way to run a business? Another question besides for the lumpiness is the leverage tolerance that public markets will support for these businesses. Really understandably so, these businesses are all quite levered in the private context because they have access to that efficient construction financing I talked about, project financing, and then as the construction and finance stabilizes, there's also pretty efficient ABS and CMBS markets that exist to take out the construction financing with more permanent financing at pretty high loan-to-values. In the public markets, public investors are notoriously cautious on leverage, and that's not to say that there are not businesses where they won't stretch because they like the story, they like the growth profile, they like certain aspects of the leverage, such as the fact that the debt may be non-recourse, as data-centered debt often is, and other things like that, but it's still an education process with investors. If investors approach these businesses and say, I'm going to think about leverage the way I think about any traditional tech company or REIT, they're probably in for some education because this happens to be a market that in a private context is really efficiently financed, and it probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to go and list yourself publicly if you're going to need to use every dollar of your IPO proceeds to delever and come down to a level that we would see of leverage typical of a lot of public companies. The answer is probably somewhere in the middle. Most of these companies that go public probably need to delever from the, in many instances, robust double-digit leverage multiples that they operate at today, but they're probably not going to come all the way down to where some other publicly-traded companies are listed. So there's some uncertainty around leverage profile and what public market investors will tolerate. And we're certainly on our end spending a lot of time, as is our equity capital markets desk, talking to these investors, figuring out what we think their leverage tolerance will be, and educating these public investors on the virtues of all the growth coming to the sector and this being a way of playing the AI trade and AI infrastructure, but that what comes along with that is some need to accept leverage. And then I think beyond that, the last thing I'd say on the public markets front is also the question of what exactly we will take public when we think about listing one of these businesses. So the base case may very well be, I'm just going to take the entire company public. Let's just say it's a typical data center developer that's effectively owned 100% by some infrastructure fund today, and it has a combination of development assets on its balance sheet. It's got some assets that are stabilized at this point. It's got a pipeline. The plain vanilla way of going and taking that public is just going and listing the whole company and deciding how big of an IPO you're going to do, how much you're going to delever to, what the sort of sell-down plan is for the existing owner. But I think a very fair question that these companies and their owners are asking themselves is do I need to take the whole business public necessarily, or should I be taking just the stabilized assets public to the extent I think there are sort of yield-focused investors out there that might like buying the assets that are stabilized, which, by the way, may also solve the capital recycling problem that we talked about at the outset of the call. Or do I do the opposite and do I say, well, I think investors are really interested in growth and want exposure to the development, so I'm going to keep the stabilized assets privately listed or put them into a yield co or something like that, and I'm going to go and just list the development piece? Or do I do something in between, right? Do I list the operating company where the management team, et cetera, sits, and do I list some development assets and some stabilized assets but ultimately have private vehicles I create that I can put some development that maybe I want to keep really highly levered or some other stabilized assets that I found a long-term buyer for? Do I want to keep those private and have some flexibility? It sounds complicated, but I think it's partly because it is. I think there's not a clear answer that has emerged yet in terms of what the optimal structure will be for the capital markets, and I also don't think it's going to be the same for every company. I suspect putting the crystal ball lens on again, like I think if you fast forward a year or two, we're going to see one of some of these companies that are contemplating an IPO decided that they do indeed want to list, and if they do, is that on the heels of having done some kind of transaction to set themselves up for like a programmatic stabilized buyer so that that can be part of the marketing story to the public markets? Have they separately brought in an investor for some development assets that they want to do, or are they doing the so-called plain vanilla approach of just listing the whole business? I think that's one of the questions that these guys are all facing. Very interesting. I'm going to have to make sure our colleagues here that cover the IPO market listen to this podcast, so some really interesting takeaways, so I appreciate that. This next topic I want to go into that I alluded to at the intro, I've asked other guests, previous guests on Crossroads about it, Raoul Martinek, CEO of DataBank, and Mike Hockenadel, Managing Director of Harrison Street. So let me throw it over to you, Alex, I would like to hear your take. We mentioned next-gen workloads. It's been said that enterprises represent quite a significant opportunity for AI inference. Can you walk us through what you're seeing here and the opportunity for data center developers, operators? Yeah, for sure. Well, and Raoul and Mike probably have as good a perspective as any on that topic, given that I think it's an area they both know well and so have a pretty formed thesis on. I'd say the following. If you think historically, let's rewind to like pre the AI era that we're in now and just think about the cloud era, if you will, of the past several years where large enterprises, right, and I'm not talking about typical retail colo customers. I'm talking about large, you know, Fortune 100 and 500 enterprises with really giant, sophisticated IT needs. You think about how most of them have their compute infrastructure, if you will, set up, and they probably have a combination of workloads in the public cloud, right, on AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. They have some workloads that might be on-prem in data centers that they themselves own for their own use. And then they probably have some workloads that are sitting in co-location data centers where they're paying someone to lease space in a facility. If you now fast forward to the AI era where large enterprises are all thinking about AI strategies, some further along than others, but most large enterprises would probably tell you we better have a real meaningful AI strategy and we probably are budgeting our IT budgets to be spending a fair bit on the application layer of AI going forward so that we can implement these tools in our organizations. If you think about that world that we're sort of entering and are already in in some ways but are further entering over the next couple of years, our view is that these enterprises are going to also approach their IT infrastructure in this sort of hybrid fashion that I explained where they're probably going to have some workloads that are sitting in public clouds, they're going to have some that might be sitting on-prem or sitting in private clouds, and then they're probably going to have some that are located in co-located data centers. And we haven't seen all large enterprises going and actually buying GPUs themselves and owning the chips, but obviously one of the questions facing the industry is whether others beyond NVIDIA will be able to produce these GPUs, and particularly the extent that others are, if we fast forward a couple of years from now, will large enterprises actually be buyers of GPUs themselves, own the underlying infrastructure, and then need somewhere to put it? And in that world where that's the case, they're probably not going to put all these workloads on-prem, they're going to need to put some in co-located data centers, and thus the size of the deployments that these large enterprises are going to have in co-located data centers are going to be a heck of a lot bigger than they've been historically because of the sheer power consumption that these next-gen chips require. And if you zoom back out and look at the data center market today, and we've been talking on a kind of no-names basis about all these developers that are big and infrafund-backed and have really scaled over the past few years, the vast majority of what they're all going after is the hyperscale opportunity. And I totally understand why that's the case, because one, they're backed by large deep-pocketed infrafunds that have a mandate to put a lot of money to work. Two, there have been very efficient debt financing markets to help them procure efficient construction financing and stabilized financing that we talked about. And so if you're one of these players, and you have Microsoft or Amazon or Google or whomever coming to you wanting to sign up another 200 or 300 megawatt deal, you're in the business of velocity. Your goal is like, hey, as long as the returns math works, I probably want to go sign that up, and I know I'm going to be able to get efficient financing for it, and I just want to continue that sort of flywheel and keep going and going and going at scale, and that's why these businesses have gotten to be so big. But there is a, someone in the market needs to be going after the deals that by all measures are still big deals, they're just not as big as the hyperscale deals, but from a pricing standpoint also tend to be a little bit more lucrative, because you're not negotiating against one of the big hyperscalers that also have self-built programs and a million options of who they can go to. You're negotiating with an enterprise that is probably a little bit more dependent on you being able to come through with something, and thus the yield on cost that these enterprise projects are built to do tend to be juicier than hyperscale projects, even if they're a little bit smaller in size. And again, when you're a pure play sort of hyperscale developer, I think it's a bit of a, even if you recognize that there's an opportunity in the market to go after enterprise, it requires, one, a certain mindset, two, it requires patience, because there is, the pace of capital deployment against enterprise is just definitionally takes longer to go and put X number of billions of dollars to work going after the enterprise opportunity than the hyperscale opportunity, and it also requires building the sales force and the machinery and the whole engine that it takes to go and sell to large enterprises, which is kind of a different beast than going and selling to hyperscalers. So someone in the market is going to need to go after that, and I think the question is who is best placed to do it? Is it some of these new upstarts that are cropping up and are backed by deep-pocketed investors that are going after this on a greenfield basis, and would sort of play back the thesis that I just rattled off and say, no one's going after this, we really need to go after this? Obviously, the databanks of the world, as you pointed out, this is kind of a core part of their strategy, and they're going after that part of the market as well. There's the question of whether some of the smaller retail co-location companies that have really nice businesses, but have historically been a little bit more retail-oriented, will some of them have the capital to move upmarket and use their expertise-serving enterprises to kind of go and serve larger enterprises and larger deployments? I think that's the question we're waiting to see pan out. But we've long been believers in this enterprise thesis and the fact that it's somewhat underserved in the market. And I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, I think overall for the market, it's a good thing. Maybe I feel like our thesis on this is now a little bit less differentiated, but when I think of a few of the major conferences that I've attended in the past few months and the investor conversations and operator conversations I've had, it just feels like it went from nobody talking about this to all of a sudden having 10 unrelated conversations in a couple-week time span about people saying, boy, there's a real opportunity to go after here in enterprise. Everyone's sort of saying the same thing, like, who's going to go after that? What should the return profile be, et cetera? So it's a part of the market we're going to follow, and I also suspect if we talk a year from now, it will emerge with a little bit more clarity who's actually going after that part of the industry. Gotcha. Yeah, I think let us hop back on the crossroads in a year from now to talk about that and others. I think we're out of time here. I know there was other topics we wanted to get to, but again, we could park those and bring them up another time. Alex, this was great, and I'm sure insightful for our listeners.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor for Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Our guests today are Domenico Tripodi and Amanda Tonsgaard from AIP Management, a Denmark-based investment manager. Domenico is Co-Head of Investments for the firm, while Amanda is Head of Investor Relations. Amanda Domenico, thank you for coming on the podcast. Thank you for having us. Thanks, Andrew. So, Amanda, can you give our listeners a brief introduction to your firm? Absolutely. Our origins are a bit special. So we were founded back in 2012 by PK, which is a large pension plan here in Denmark for the healthcare workers and the nurses. And they wanted to invest in something called renewable energy. Maybe it was not even called that at the time. Since 2012, we've invested 7 billion across 25 assets in Europe and the U.S. In 2018, we did a management buyout. So our last two funds have been fully independent and we're currently investing a 4 billion Euro fund. In terms of your investments, 1.0 has been running at capacity. They're going to generate 7 gigawatts and contribute to avoiding around 10 million tons of greenhouse gases and support about 6 million households. That's pretty much the number of households we have in Denmark. Well, thank you for that introduction. Now, before we jump into it, I'm also interested in hearing a little bit about your backgrounds, both with AIP and before joining the firm. Domenico, why don't you start? So I've been at AIP for a bit over eight years, but I spent most of my career in the renewable energy industry. So I worked across the value chain to work for an OEM, for a developer in fund management before that. So you can say that my profile is industry focused, quite specialized in the sector. And Amanda, what is your background? My background is slightly different. I started out as a lawyer doing M&A, and then I moved into being an investor. But most of my career, I've been in what I call private markets focused on investor relations, fundraising, which comes up to like 20 plus years by now. And last year, I decided to go to the greener side and joined AIP to head up their investor relations function with a view to help them broaden their investor base. All right. Well, great. Thank you for that. Now, you mentioned that you're based in Denmark, that you invest across the US and Europe. When did you enter the US market? We started to look in the US in 2016. I think we looked at a few opportunities for a couple of years before pulling the trigger and decided to do the first investment in 2018. So now it has been seven years. Fast forward to today, we have a number of investment and soon close to 2.5 billion euros of commitment in the US, an office in New York, a team there, and I'm also responsible for our US ventures from Copenhagen. So it has been quite an exciting journey until today, and the future will also be exciting. Well, very much so. You started looking in 2016, you made your first investment in 2018. As a renewables-focused investor, you were entering this market during the first Trump administration. I know that at the moment, there's a lot of fear over in Europe and a lot of hesitancy because of the change in administration and potential changes in policy, specifically looking at renewable investment. You're here on the podcast, so I guess you guys aren't forgetting about, aren't leaving the US altogether. I'm curious to hear what your approach is now under this new administration. It's a particularly fluid period with lots of moving parts. But if you want to isolate the two macro pieces in here, I think on one side, you have the fundamentals for renewable energy being stronger than ever in the US, especially for solar and battery storage. So the cost of the levelized cost of electricity has dropped. Now you also have a US-based manufacturing supply chain, which has emerged in the last few years. And most importantly, demand is growing. We should not take for granted that the US is probably one of the few mature markets that are experiencing already a certain demand growth and projections are even more bullish on growth. That's one side of the coin which speaks in favor of generation and renewable energy generation in particular. On the other end, I think it's impossible to ignore that the regulatory and macro landscape might be changing. On one end, you have the IRA, where changes are very possible. We shouldn't ignore that. Nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, but changes are very possible. It's very important to focus on tangible projects, projects that have safe harbor equipment, that have a clear site to execution, while longer term pipeline, while still valuable, are a bit more difficult to assess. The other big elephant in the room is the impact of the potential tariff. It's still unclear what is going to happen and what the impact might be. But I think the overall big question is if tariffs get rolled over in a significant fashion, what will be the demand elasticity after power prices will go up? Until today, strong developers and power producers have been able to pass the cost through or a part of the cost through to the ultimate off taker. So there's been a high level of demand elasticity. But I think the big question is that at what point the equation breaks, how much can be absorbed? These are all question mark. I'm sorry, I'm not giving you answers in here. But from our side, what we're focusing on is more the executable part of the pipeline project that safe harbor equipment is largely purchased, PPA are in place. So there certainly is that uncertainty that you mentioned. As an investor, I mean, obviously, you're looking for these immediate safe harbor projects, but long term, how does that affect your approach? I think if you look at the structure of the IRA, you still have like four years to execute, right? But I think independently, if the IRA gets rolled back in the near future, still have a long way to execute. So I think it's going back to the old times. I think it's important to focus, as I said before, in investing in developers or projects that are ready to be executed, which does not mean they need to be executed today or tomorrow. I think they can still be executed over the next three to five years. From our side, as I said before, it's focusing on what you have a clear sight on with an execution over the next five years. What happens after that, I think is difficult to forecast, but it looks like going back to the old structure of continuous extension of the IRA, I'm guessing now, but from the LP point of view is looking at the near term future, which gives a good runway for this fund investment period. And Amanda, you're working more directly with LPs, with investors into your firm. How do you sell them on the fact that you're going to continue investing in the US renewable space? Is there hesitancy from your LP base? It's a good question. If I look at sort of our immediate investor base, we have a very small base, and that's how our origin started out. We're very supportive. And I think the longer term, they still believe the US is a good market. As Jim Menneke said, it's one of the largest markets. It has a huge amount of growth. We've seen a lot of invested capital going in. You're moving a lot more to domestic manufacturing, on-shoring. It's a big market, and there's a strong business case of fundamentals that support it. I was in Berlin last week together with thousands of other people from the industry, and obviously there was a lot of talk about what do we think about the US as investors and limited partners. And I think they're basically, there are two camps. I think there are those that are like, let's wait. There's a lot of uncertainty. We just need to sit it out. And then there are those that are cautious, I would say optimism, because of the reasons I just gave, big market, big growth. It's critical for national security, affordability. A lot of job creations are happening as well. And if you look at some of the more Republican-led states, that's where you've seen a lot of the growth. So I think for those who believe there is a strong business case behind this, there are opportunities if you know where to find them. And when I say know where to find them, that means you have the experience and enough sort of deep expertise to execute on it. That's exactly the point. I think our hypothesis is that the current uncertainty will create even more marketing efficiencies that we will be able to exploit. I think with some people taking a bit more of a cautious approach, you will need more room for investors like us. And that's what we're already seeing. We're seeing two big macro effects, the front-loading of the execution, and at the same time, some investors putting their feet on the brake, right? So I think these two forces support our investment hypothesis. Well, that's another thing that's been a bit of a theme. While there is this uncertainty, if you're willing to take a view or to find a position where you think there are strong opportunities, it could be a potential buyer's market. There could be real buying opportunities. I mean, is that something you are seeing? Indeed. I think now we are very active in the US. I mean, we have a very light pipeline and we are very close to closing actually a couple of deals after one dry year, which sounds a bit paradoxical given the uncertainty. But that's exactly the point. I think you summarized it very well, Andrew. I think the current uncertainty and the capital needs create a buyer's market. But I think it's also more buyer markets for those who have stable capital and deep pockets. So I think those that are larger will probably benefit from this because there will be M&A opportunities for smaller developers who may not be able to raise the financing given the uncertainty you see today. Overall, what is the mood in Europe towards investing in energy in the US and investing in specifically renewables, clean energy? Is yours a minority of you or are a lot of European investors saying, I can't make sense of this, I want no part of this and see you in four years, maybe? I don't think that's the case. I mean, all the US is just too big to ignore, right? And some people might scale down a bit what they're going to allocate to the US. But I think fundamentally, the growth will continue. But the focus to some of the points Dominika mentioned about the current regulation we have that may shift, but I think the drive to more clean renewable energy, that's going to continue. So shifting focus a little bit, your firm is very focused on clean energy, on the future of energy that's low carbon, carbon free. But I'm curious, and this is a question I think we've had for the industry for a long time. How do you balance that with the need to make sure you're maximizing returns for your LP base? We don't believe that two things contradict each other in the end of the day, we cannot give up on the quest for return, if anything, the returns is the primary point. And the secondary point is to have an impact, a positive impact on our planet, but we cannot put the returns after the impact, it will never work, it will not be a sustainable strategy. In fact, I think generally, the energy transition has provided investment opportunities, which we believe are not just sustainability driven. I think the energy transition answered the broader energy dilemma of affordability, security and sustainability. And so I don't think we need to give up on any of these points. I think finally, we have a solution inside, of course, there are improvements that need to come. And the system needs to be able to integrate renewables, we'll talk about this in a second. But I think we have a solution that answers to the full energy dilemma. I think for us as well, I mean, we have a pre agreed mandate and strategy, which we've been pursuing since 2012. It's all about decarbonization, could be renewables generation, transmission, storage, and years of decarbonization as well. At the end of the day, it's a big part of our investment strategy to have sustainability to go through it. If you don't think that stacks up, our strategy wouldn't work. Also, our emphasis is to deploy quite large sums of capital in a cost efficient manner. So we're also in a part of the sort of infrastructure universe where that makes sense. Well, thank you for that explanation. And that's very interesting. It's something we always kind of keep in our mind when looking at the clean energy investment industry. Now, going back to sector focus, what sectors is your firm looking at? Where are you investing? Where are you targeting, even if you haven't made an investment yet? We discuss renewable energy generation, which is at the core of what we do, but we look at the broader decarbonization of the energy sector. So beside generation, we look at storage, of course, energy storage, transmission, but we have recently also started to look at the demand side of the business. So the load side, we are investing in electric transport, mainly Rolleys stocks, electrified Rolleys stocks. And recently, we have also invested in one of the first green steel manufacturing plant up in northern Sweden. So our strategy starts to be a bit broader in the sense that we cover the full spectrum of the energy transition. And what about emerging technologies? I think that wind, solar, batteries now, those are getting to the point where, you know, they're very well established, but there's a plethora of technologies that are a little bit less stable at this point. Are there any that are interesting to you, either for an imminent investment or in the near to medium term? Yeah, I think generally, the biggest challenge that we have in the industry is to integrate the intermediate renewable generation in a system, right? So it's to make the backbone of the system based on renewable energy. And I think the biggest thing that has to do with integration to me is the focus of the future. So we spoke about storage, it's not necessarily new technology, but it is battery storage. It's an evolving, constantly evolving technology and improving. New type of storage are also emerging. They're still immature. We have not done large investment outside lithium ion batteries, but there will be new technology emerging in the storage space, solid state batteries, etc. Transmission is a very old technology, but I think it's gaining prominence in allowing for a larger grid to allow high penetration of renewables. But the big one, which is a bit untapped, is around demand and demand response. What I mean with that is that the energy system will be inherently more volatile, and allowing for the demand to scale up and down also depending on the generation is the big challenge. So we are currently investing on the load side, making it as flexible as possible. We have discussed our green steel investment. It has some level of flexibility. It's a novel technology, so it's a direct reduction based on hydrogen. So there are novel technology, but I think there are also some old ones that need to be used more than what has been done until today to allow for a better integration of renewables in the system. It's interesting when you talk about demand response. I think that's definitely a big part of the way that we're going to meet the energy challenge. But it's a little bit less obvious how you make that investable for an infrastructure investor. How do you create infrastructure investments that are at scale with that strategy? Yeah, no, that's a very good point. And actually, we are studying it and we are creating some business model now. I think you need to correctly point out individual investments for demand response are relatively small. So our idea is to form a portfolio through energy as a service companies that provide smaller capex investment, but through a large portfolio of industrial clients. I think you got it totally right. So we need to start somewhere. So the first investment might be small, but through integration of platform and through scaling up platform, we believe that we can get to the necessary scale of investments. But very good point. Well, the energy mix is changing. The energy demand mix is changing. And certainly the approach from infrastructure investors is changing, too. I think that infrastructure investors across the continents, across the globe and across the range of types of investors are looking beyond what maybe five to 10 years ago when I started covering the sector would have been considered an obvious infrastructure investment. We see that in a lot of ways. You mentioned transmission earlier, and I think that's a really interesting topic. It seems like that's something that's underinvested in the U.S. A lot of people are talking about it. We always hear no transition without transmission. But not a lot of investors are making big investments. We wrote a story earlier this week about Pattern Energy and some of their massive investments in transmission. But they're kind of few and far between. Is that someplace you as an investor see opportunities? It's another good point. Unfortunately, the opportunity for private capital are still limited. We have some opportunity in Europe. I think it's a bit more privatized market, especially on the U.K. side and Ireland, for example. But I mean, I agree with you that the opportunities for private capital are still limited. It must be. But it must be a sector that needs to grow and needs to attract capital, because you pointed out it's probably the low hanging fruit to allow a higher penetration of renewables. And in the energy sector, the major theme in the U.S., and I think it's similar in Europe, it's all about A.I. That's all we've heard for the last year, year and a half, is how we've had this flat load growth for the last two to three decades. And the entire energy system has kind of been based around that. And all of a sudden, that's been upended with the demand growth that's going to be needed to power A.I. And I think there maybe are some nuances and contradictions in there. And you can you can say, yeah, but for a few things, but that does seem to be the overall narrative that it's been about phasing out. That's been that the effort has been about replacing conventional power with renewable power. And now all of a sudden, it's no, we need to dramatically increase our power. So I'm curious, and maybe this is kind of a two part question. How do renewable investments fit into that? And 10 years from now, five years from now, whatever. What is the energy mix going to look like both in the U.S. and in Europe? I know that's a lot there. No, but certainly in the U.S., we see the demand growing already as a function of general economic growth and also data center demand. I think the A.I. demand is there. We see the demand on the offtake side. There are very different projections in terms of growth coming from the A.I., but all the projection indicate a significant growth. The span is very large, but there is growth anywhere. And we see the offtakers putting the money where their mouth is. So we see that trend unfolding already today. Renewable energy, I mean, it's already playing a role. A.I. offtakers are looking for renewable energy PPA. I think they're moving more and more to markets where there is more grid stability as well to also count on renewable energy. But yeah, renewable energy does play a role. But I think going forward, I think the point, the second question is a bit linked to the end of my first answer, is how does the energy mix of the future looks like? That's a very difficult question. I can tell you what we see today and subject to more demand response and more transmission and more storage, I think there is still a long way to go in terms of a renewable energy penetration. I think we have not answered in full the last questions about what we call in Europe down can flouter, which is like this period where you don't have solar and wind and the short term storage is not sufficient to fill that gap. So in the foreseeable future, gas will still play a role. We don't have the technology at the moment to cover that last part. So the way I see the energy system is a mix of renewable energy, solar, wind, storage, as I said before, coupled with transmission and demand response and gas. I think there is a bit of nuclear renaissance nowadays. There's lots of discussion around nuclear, but I'm not entirely convinced about the merit of new nuclear. Of course, if there is existing nuclear, I think it has its own merit. But new nuclear, I don't see much merits of new nuclear in the system, given the cost and the inflexibility of that type of generation. Plus, in some countries, there is a lot of opposition to it in the public as well. Example in the countries where Domenico and I are from. That's interesting. I see there has been a mood shift when it comes to nuclear, but it's not going to look like it did in the last generation of nuclear. You might have a few nuclear plants restarting, but the future of nuclear, if there is a resurgence, is going to be these small module reactors. And I think there are going to be issues of siting there. You know, everybody or a lot of people probably think they're a good idea, but not in their own backyard. That'll be interesting to see. And Amanda, when you look at the shifting environment, how does your role change? How does that change how you are working with LPs and how you're working with investors? I don't think that it changes a lot, to be honest. We have a certain strategy. We've been doing this for quite a while. We know what we're good at, and we're going to continue to do that. We're not everything for everyone. So I think it's a question of finding the investors that understand our strategy, want to buy into it, and like what we're delivering. And that's just a dialogue you need to have. As I said, we have a small group of very supportive investors. We're meeting with new investors, introducing ourselves, and seeing where there's a good fit with long-term stable returns, the focus on decarbonization and the sustainability angle. And I appreciate, you know, that's one strategy, and there are many others that have different. You mentioned yourself, infrastructure has grown so much. And you know, I come from the PE world. It goes from super, super core to what is probably much more growth venture. And that's all about the risk return appetite of the investors at the end of the day and how it fits into their portfolio. And Domenico, did you want to add something about the idea of a nuclear renaissance? Thanks for the question. I think it was more related to where the U.S. and Europe sit in this potential future energy mix, right? I think the U.S. is in a more privileged position because it can benefit from more abundant and cheaper gas. I think it is the transition and the energy system I described already in sight, right? While Europe still needs to answer the question on how to source economic or relatively cheap gas. And if you think about the history already, right, in summer 21, Europe was making a plan for its energy system that rely on renewable energy and gas. Then you know what has happened in 22, therefore putting all our plans upside down. But what I wanted to say is that the U.S. has the opportunity to achieve this low carbon energy system relatively soon. Well, thank you both. A lot of really interesting insights here. And if people want to learn a little bit more about your firm, where can they go other than hopping on a plane to Denmark? They're always welcome to come and visit us.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas, or Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is Kevin Smith, CEO of Erivan Energy. Kevin, thank you for joining the podcast. Thanks, Andrew. A pleasure to be here. So, Kevin, people who are active in the renewable energy space are very familiar with your firm. But for the rest of our listeners, can you tell me about Erivan and how the firm came to be both an independent company and one of the most active investors in the renewable energy space? Thanks, Andrew. Erivan, really, it has only been active in the space as an independent company for, you know, just about five years or so, maybe a bit under five years or so. Originally, you know, the predecessor company, there was a group called Capital Dynamics, which was more acquisition of operating assets, had a number of funds and big investors. In 2021, three big investors decided to form Erivan as an independent, standalone entity. So they pulled out a couple of gigawatts of assets and a portion of the team, and they kind of reformed into Erivan Energy as 100% standalone. We have three big investors, CalSTRS, a Netherlands-based pension fund called APG, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. So starting in 2021, then they kind of ramped up that business into its own standalone entity, you know, full greenfield development capabilities. So rather than acquiring operating assets, we're taking projects kind of full development scale from, you know, greenfield activities into commercial operations. And we have a long-term ownership position. That's our agenda is to own and operate these facilities long-term. Right now, we've got about just over four gigawatts in operation. We've got about a gigawatt and a half in construction right now. And over the last 18 months, we've closed more than $3 billion in new projects. Our focus is exclusively on solar plus storage and standalone battery storage. We are looking at some other parts of the business and other technologies. But when you look at our development pipeline, which is about six gigawatts plus and growing, and you look at our operating and construction projects, it's limited to that solar plus energy storage and utility-scale battery storage activity. We've had a really good run over the last couple of years, a lot of new projects going into construction. We're active in the West, in California, in WAC, in MISO. We've got a number of projects in construction. So we're really excited about continuing to move forward. And Kevin, you've been with the firm about 18 months, if I'm doing the math correctly. Can you tell our listeners a little bit about your background before joining Arivan? Yeah, I took over here as CEO in August of 2023. So that's just over 18 months ago. Prior to that, I was CEO of the Americas, which was US and Latin America for LightSource BP. There we kind of ramped up and built, you know, three or four gigawatts in projects as well. My background has been exclusively in the energy industry for 40 years, I'll say, maybe a little longer. The last 20 or so has been in renewable energy, large-scale wind. I headed up Invenergy in the early days when we branched into the wind industry from natural gas and then have moved into solar in 2008. So a lot of solar and energy storage activities over the last 15 years or so. So it sounds like you have a lot of experience both in the renewable part of the energy industry and before that in traditional energy. Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting perspective. In the first half of my career, as I say, I was the renewable energy industry wasn't really very cost competitive or really much of a player, you know, back in the, we'll say in the 90s and early 2000s. So being in the energy industry, it was primarily conventional energy. I did nuclear energy design, nuclear facility design, power design, and early in my career I got out of college and then developed a lot of natural gas projects both in the U.S. and internationally. And so that gives me a pretty good understanding of, you know, what it takes to develop a natural gas fired facility, what the economics look like, what the cost structures, power contracts look like, and then be able to kind of cost compare and, you know, terms and conditions compare to how renewable energy projects are structured and costed out. Well, very interesting. Now, if you're an Infralogix subscriber, you'll recall having read recently that Rivam closed a $258 million financing package on a large battery project in San Diego. Kevin, I'm wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about that project and also what it was like getting a deal like that done in the current uncertain environment for renewables. The Peregrine project is an interesting project. It's a 200 megawatt, two-hour battery, really in downtown San Diego, just off the harbor, reutilizing Tesla equipment. The Megapack equipment is really the state-of-the-art, safest equipment as we move forward. And we put together a financing package. We're just finalizing the tax equity on that. Despite the uncertainty in the market, we still got very good reception on all aspects of the debt. We've got a pref equity investor as well as the tax equity. We've closed a number of transactions. We've got a huge project that we closed earlier in the year, late last year. The Elon projects, Elon 1 was closed in early 2024, and Elon 2 closed towards the end. But that project is about a $2 billion project in Kern County, California, which is a combination of solar and battery storage. So it's a total, both units is around 600 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of Megapack battery storage. So that's, like I said, that's around a $2 billion project with power sales to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, LEDWP. Those are just a few of the projects that we have. We've got about a billion dollars of investments going in construction right now in Indiana, largely just solar-based. So like I said, largely we're focusing on the solar markets and solar plus storage. And then we have a number of standalone storage projects moving forward along the coast in California. A lot of the conversations that we are having these days about the renewables sector have focused on the uncertainty, both when it comes to some of the ongoing secular trends, but especially political uncertainty when it comes to the future of the IRA, tariffs, and the like. How are you finding the environment, both for developing renewables and for M&A deals? If you look at the overview on the market, which is what gives us confidence, I mean, if you look in over the last several years, I mean, renewable energy really has dominated the landscape. And not really because of mandates within states about building renewable energy. It's really because renewable energy is extremely cost-effective. Just in 2024, 90% of new generation built in 2024 was renewable energy. 80% of it was solar and battery storage. So solar dominated last year, 60% plus of new generation was solar in 2024. We expect that trend is going to continue in the future, largely because solar and energy storage are very cost competitive. If you look at the investment over the last couple of years, since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, there's more than $250 billion of investments in the U.S. in new projects and manufacturing activities. So we see a huge amount of manufacturing activities continuing to progress in the U.S. So manufacturing for trackers, module supply activities. And what's interesting is, is almost 80% of that new investment is in Republican-leaning or Republican-voting states. It would be hard for me to see the current Congress, even though it's, you know, a heavy Republican bias, to take those jobs and that investment out of their own districts. So I think that's a fundamental issue that we see supporting kind of continued growth in the renewable energy industry, particularly in solar and battery storage. You know, I think the markets expect that as well. I mean, we're going to see some upsets. We're having to deal with some of the tariff issues, which is changing prices that we're offering to utilities and our corporate clients, which is ultimately going to change. Consumer prices are going to go up with those additional tariffs. So we're having to deal with those dynamics in the market. But, you know, we're still very bullish on seeing the renewable energy industry and solar and energy storage, particularly continuing to grow as we see the markets move forward. So Kevin, you're talking about being bullish in a time of uncertainty. Do you think that presents opportunities? Because some folks that I've spoken to have said that if you're willing to take a political view, this could be a good market for buyers when it comes to M&A opportunities in the renewable space. Yeah, I would, I'd fully agree with that. I mean, there is uncertainty. You know, uncertainty favors, to a certain extent, it favors some of the larger players that have, you know, strong funding investors and we've got a really a really strong stable of investors. So that gives us staying power in the market. We can look at transactions. We're not pressed to do things to, you know, keep our revenue stack going. You know, we've got a nice operating base of projects with long term power contracts. So we've got, you know, strong EBITDA and cash flow in the organization. So we can pick and choose what assets we want to look at. As you said, that uncertainty does cause problems with others that maybe have less committed investors into the market. And so we're certainly looking in the M&A sector more from a development assets, early stage, mid stage development assets. And so we're looking at over the next year or two, a really good market for us on the M&A side as we see that uncertainty that not all firms can weather through. Well, I'm sure InfraLogic readers will be reading your firm's name a lot in the coming year and a half then. Yeah, that's the expectations. I mean, we've got our own projects that we expect to continue to push into construction. We've got a big two phase project in Missouri called CALSO, 450 megawatt DC project solar that we're looking to reach financial close in the near future. And we've just initiated a construction on that project. And we've got a number of other battery storage projects that we're pushing forward on. But then in addition, we also are looking in the M&A market, both individual projects. And, you know, we may find ourselves looking at a at a large portfolio opportunity here in the in the near future if that opportunity presents itself as a good fit for us. Now, Kevin, you mentioned that right now Arivan is really focused on solar and batteries. But you also said that there might be the prospect for other types of investments. What kind of other technologies do you find interesting? Do you think might end up in your portfolio in the near future? There's kind of maybe two parts of that question. You know, what tech news technologies do we find interesting and maybe completely different question of what technologies we may find in our portfolio in the near future. So I think for the near future, we're likely going to stay pretty focused on that solar and energy storage side. I mean, we we're looking at, you know, longer duration storage, which may be as a, you know, a subset of energy storage. Newer technologies, obviously, there's all kinds of power generation technologies out there. There's, you know, small, small modular nuclear reactors. There's carbon capture. There's green hydrogen, you know, geothermal, all those. And we're we're monitoring those both on whether or not there's there's an interest for us to invest in some of those technologies, but also looking at, you know, making sure we're competitive against those kinds of technologies. There's a lot of discussions on a rebirth on the natural gas side of the business. That's not something that we or our investors would be looking to invest in, but we will be monitoring that to understand, you know, how cost competitive natural gas is and how much of a player natural gas is as as we look over the next several years. Well, it's interesting. I mean, we've talked a little bit about some of the political factors, but you also have the growth of AI, the need to build out data centers to support that. And everybody's talking about the power that will be needed to support that also. I mean, how is the power mix in America going to change in the coming years and how does that affect your business? Well, as I said, my view is renewables are still going to be the dominant force going forward. I mean, if you just look at what's happened over the last several years and that's and that's largely market based, price based demand. A lot of the states across the Midwest have been dominant renewable energy, despite the fact that they don't really have renewable energy mandates. Moving forward, we have the data center theoretical explosion of power demand that we're going to see. We see forecasts of from historically, you know, half a percent to one percent growth in energy and electricity demand. Now we're seeing in some markets three, four, five, six, seven percent growth expectations, which is, you know, just unheard of in the markets over the last 20 to 30 years. And we're going to have to figure out a way as an industry to meet that demand. Certainly there's going to be an increase, you know, I'll say across the board. Natural gas will probably have a more significant role going forward than they have over the last few years. But developing a natural gas fired project is, I'll say, more difficult than it is to develop a renewable energy project. You know, there's it creates real pollution. So you have pushback from local communities. You know, it has its land issues. It has equipment supply constraints for gas turbine technology that takes it out to three, four year delivery times. You've got to get firm transportation, you know, if you're going to provide firm supply. And the gas pipelines are pretty much chocked full. So you know, it has water supply issues, which in drought areas is difficult to get water supply for cooling. So natural gas projects, I think are going to, we're probably going to see a bit of an uptick, but it's not going to, they're not going to be a dominant force. Moving forward, I still believe it's going to be largely a solar and battery storage kind of market, as we see over the next few years, a bit of an uptick in natural gas. Data centers, you know, a lot of there's a lot of discussions about islanding off data centers so they get their own dedicated power supply. But those data centers have demands that they're looking for, you know, 99.99 percent reliability. You're really only going to get that if they stay grid connected. So I think it's largely still going to be around power supply to the grid, allowing the utilities to look across their portfolio, which includes a mix of fossil fuel generation, nuclear and renewables, and having them supply those data centers, you know, as opposed to a data center trying to put together a structure that provides them reliability with an off grid solution, which, you know, I did that a lot in my career in international markets, very, very difficult to provide a 99 plus percent, let alone 99.99 with an off grid solution. So I think the vast majority of those data centers are going to have to be on grid and allowing the utilities to provide them with that very reliable power supply that we enjoy here in the U.S. What about nuclear? Can we see a little bit of a rebirth of nuclear providing some of that solution? There's a lot of talk about small modular nuclear reactors. You know, I worked in nuclear early in my career. I think we have a very safe and well-performing nuclear fleet in the U.S. It's not very cost effective right now to do that. It's probably at least double or triple what it would be to put in renewables. And I think siting issues, technology advancement, pricing structures, financing costs, other risks related to nuclear that you don't see in other technologies, in my view, we're not going to see substantial capacity from nuclear for, I'll say, at least a decade and probably longer. You're going to see pilot projects here and there that'll make a lot of great news. But I think if you're really looking at putting gigawatts onto the grid to help this boom with the data center market, I think that's at least a decade away or more. Another big development we saw last year and maybe going a little bit into 2023 was the expansion of the tax credit market with the transfer, with the tax transfer and the hybrid market really emerging following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. And I think there were hopes of that expansion could continue even even further. I'm wondering if you're seeing a little bit of a pullback now or a little bit more hesitation now that there is a new administration and there could be a lower tax rate that could affect tax equity. There could be changes to the IRA. What are you seeing from the tax equity market? We play in both, you know, I'll say conventional tax equity structures. The Elan project that I talked about was a conventional tax equity structure with Wells Fargo. We're also very active in the tax credit transfer market with a number of big players. You know, a lot of household names are becoming more active in that. We continue to see pretty strong interest on both those, you know, in the tax equity markets. There are a few players that have been on the edge that maybe they drop out or maybe they they drop in. But, you know, certainly uncertainty doesn't help the markets at all. But despite that, we're still seeing some pretty good interest in the market. We haven't had really too much problems in bringing in the necessary tax equity into our projects. And frankly, I kind of expect to see that in the future. We're just going to have to maintain flexibility, you know, if there is a change in the tax rates, if there are some changes in in the credit structures, and we're just going to have to maintain some flexibility. And like I said, unfortunately, you know, that probably favors some of the bigger firms, you know, more than some of the smaller groups that have a little bit tighter funding structures. You know, that gives us the ability to plug some gaps with our own corporate funding structures if we have some delays or some uncertainty that we've got to deal with on the tax equity side. So like I said, I think we continue to see strong interest both in conventional tax equity structures, deals with the main some of the main banks, as well as, you know, the corporates continuing to come into the tax credit structure, tax credit transfer structures. So, Kevin, you've expressed a lot of optimism, but I have to ask, as the CEO of a renewable energy company, what's the biggest thing that's keeping you up at night right now in these somewhat uncertain times? Certainly, I think tariffs are a big issue, you know, not just from our business, but also, you know, kind of general health of the economy. I mean, we're seeing the stock market drop five, six, seven hundred points in one day, up two hundred the next, down five, six hundred the next day, you know. So, you know, I think everybody's stock portfolio is down over the last few months where it was. And I think tariffs are going to have a big impact on that. It's affecting our businesses. I mean, you know, we're seeing projects now where we're having to, you know, we're bidding into utilities and now we're kind of having to pass through some of that tariff exposure. That's going to raise electricity prices across the board. And so I think probably the tariff side of it is one of the bigger worries. You know, changes to the tax credit structure largely are going to take Congress to make anything that's kind of certainly moving forward on bonus credits will take congressional action. And like I said, there's a whole lot of support that's been put into Republican districts. So we're hoping that they listen to their constituents and recognize that those projects are creating a lot of jobs and a lot of investment in Republican districts across the U.S. But I think that the tariff issues are pretty worrying. And obviously, we're hearing about it every 15 minutes in the news. It's raising the prices on everyday goods and services, and it's going to affect the electricity markets as well. And so we're going to see increases in prices where we're going to have to pay more for our goods coming into the U.S. And even if we're buying, you know, most of our projects are utilizing 100 percent U.S. steel. But if you put a tariff on steel imports into the U.S., then the U.S. suppliers are going to raise their prices up to those tariff levels. So even if we're a dedicated U.S. consumer, which for the most part, we're trying to maintain that position, it's still going to raise the prices of U.S. manufactured goods because the norm is for those U.S. suppliers to raise their prices to the competition. And if the competition is international and it has to deal with tariffs, then the U.S. suppliers will raise their prices as well. So that's probably one of the number one issues for us is how do we manage that tariff market? You know, tariffs on Canada and Mexico are on one day, off the next, now back on, you know, the auto manufacturers just got a 30 day reprieve. But, you know, who knows what it will be in the future? So I think that is adding a lot of uncertainty, not just to energy markets, but, you know, to everybody in everyday Americans across the board. Well, Kevin, thank you so much for sharing that and thank you for coming on the podcast. Of course, my pleasure. Thanks, Andrew. And I appreciate the insightful questions. And it's going to be an interesting market going forward. So, you know, as they say, buckle up. It definitely will. There's never a lack of things to talk about.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is Britta Von Ossen, a Partner and Managing Director at CRCIB. Britta, thank you for coming on to the podcast. Thanks, Andrew. Very excited to be here. Well, I'm excited to have you on. Now, Crossroads listeners should be familiar with CRCIB, since you're not the first guest from your firm. Two years ago, we had your colleague Michael Tatarsky on the podcast. But in case some need a refresher, can you give me an overview of CRCIB and where the firm's focus is in the industry? Absolutely. CRCIB is an independent investment bank. We are providing financial advisory services to any sectors in renewables, the energy transition, and sustainability. We spend about half of our time focused on project financing, and that could be raising tax equity, debt, sponsor equity for projects, for example, in wind, solar, storage, carbon capture, R&G, hydrogen, etc. The other half we do is very traditional investment banking, so focusing on M&A, corporate capital raises, things of that nature. And readers of Infralogic are probably very familiar with CRCIB. When we publish our semiannual or, I guess, quarterly rankings for advisors, CRCIB is always at or near the top of the list when it comes to renewable energy deals. And Britta, what is your background, both in the industry, since you came to CRCIB before you joined the firm? How did you get into this space? I have been with CRCIB for 11 years now. I joined as a vice president, helped implement our West Coast presence for the firm. And prior to banking, I was in development. So I was head of corporate strategy for Gestamp Solar, a Spanish solar developer here in the U.S. And before that, I was running the Italy operations of a German wind developer called WKN Wind, Kraft Nord. I always find that so interesting. Some people come to renewable banking from another part of the banking industry, while some come from a different part of renewables. Do you think that gives you a different perspective than people who have purely a banking background? I think starting out, absolutely. There are so many intricacies and nuances to the project-specific side of renewables and the development lifecycle and all of the various components that go into that. So it's made running processes on the project finance side and the asset sales side very second nature. Because I grew up with these industries, I grew up with these technologies and understand what is needed to get them in development. So it's definitely an interesting time for the renewable energy industry. There's the continuing momentum from the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. And at the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty, in particular, for no small part of that, because there is a new administration with a very different view of the energy sector than the Biden administration had. To start out, there's a lot of details we could dive into. But big picture, is it a fun time to be a clean energy banker? It's always a fun time to be a clean energy banker. But one of the main reasons is because we have never had policy certainty in the 11 years that I've been doing this. There have always been sun setting tax credits, changes of administration, new state programs and state policies that are changing. And all of that directly impacts investors and the capital markets. So in this job, we are continuously changing what is market, continuously pushing creative and strategic new structures and strategies. And so it's always fun to do this job. I think right now, renewables has hit a point of no return. The industry is going to continue growing and putting projects out there regardless of policy shift. I think both consumer demand and corporate demand will see to that. What policy shift will do is potentially delay or slow down or make more expensive the implementation of these projects. So one of the major changes of the Inflation Reduction Act is the impact it had on tax credits tax equity with the creation of the transfer market. And that's allowed a lot of new capital to come into that market. How are you finding the tax equity market now at the moment? So 2024 was extremely successful from a tax capital perspective. We saw lots of new corporates entering the space, lots of new tax credit buyers entering the space and very many infrastructure investors coming in for a portion of the equity, whether it was a preferred position or one of these hybrid structures or the T-flip as some call it. A lot of capital inflow in 2024. CRC has worked with several new corporate tax credit buyers and tax equity investors during that time as well to navigate the IRA and the complexities that go into that. What is interesting is now there is talk of changing this and we really only had one super solid year of understanding the legislation and understanding the guidelines. So that continued uncertainty will probably cause some investors to pause, cause some investors to take a step back and wait and see what is going to happen on the policy side. So do you anticipate the overall tax market continuing to grow this year? Do you think it might stagnate? Could it retreat? Or does it really depend on what we see from the policy side? I think general consensus is that it continues to perform as well, if not better for the near term. Even if there is a policy shift, general market consensus is there would be some level of safe harboring so that existing policy applies to projects being placed in service in the next two, maybe three years. So I don't see a huge retreat barring some type of draconian, you know, full repeal proposals from the administration. What about a big tax cut? That's another concern that I've heard. If the tax rate is significantly lowered, it could curb the appetite for this type of tax equity. It could, and that could be a driving force in reduced tax credit appetite. I think in general, timing of passing legislation has continued to put support for projects that are placing in service this year. I think there is also some pullback from the PTC market, the production tax credit market that goes over a 10-year life cycle of the project. I think both developers and investors are less confident in what the tax rate is going to be five years, two years, three years from now versus the ITC. So projects that are placing in service now are very much business as usual from the tax community. Very interesting. It does seem like things have been constantly changing and developing in the tax equity, tax transfer market. So I guess this year will be no different on that front. CRCIB is also one of the most active advisors in the M&A market. And obviously, when it comes to M&A transactions, people are looking at the policy situation, what to expect there as well. What are you finding from the renewable energy M&A market? Is there still healthy interest? The M&A market has slowed down over the last few years. I believe in 2021-2022, there was a very strong seller's market and buyers were valuing a significant amount of growth, pipelines that were in early stages, and that has pulled back a bit. The asset sale market right now continues to be very strong, but buyers are taking strategic approaches to what they will acquire. So it's no longer pipeline for pipeline's sake. It is strategic acquisitions in markets of interest of projects that they have confidence will move forward and will be built. Do you think it represents an opportunity for potential buyers right now? Do you think it is more of a buyer's market? I do. I think it has shifted to a buyer's market, both on the corporate and on the asset M&A side. And how much of that has to do with the uncertainty we're seeing on the policy front? A decent amount. We are seeing proposals for acquisitions come in with a lot of contingencies associated with what happens on the financing side, and that's hard for sellers to accept, especially when their revenue is driven from asset sales and they cannot wait several years to see what happens on policy to get paid. So buyers that can come in and take a view on what is happening on the policy side are in a very strong position to win assets and acquire assets and companies right now. And are we seeing more interest and more activity on the asset side, on the platform side, on the company side? Where are we seeing deals actually be brought to the market? Corporate equity investments are coming back in a sense, but there is still a bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers that has proven difficult to overcome in some cases. So sellers that need to transact, if they have a capital need or a parent that needs to exit, those deals are getting done and they are having multiple bids at the finish line. Whether or not those bids are meeting the hurdles that the sellers have in mind is another question. It does seem like you mentioned 2020, 2021, where you had such a seller's market. Since that's cooled down, it does seem like we've been hearing a lot about bid-ask spread. It seems like sellers haven't quite come to terms with the fact that the 2020, 2021 reality was somewhat of an aberration. I would agree with that. It is not lack of interest from investors. It's the bid-ask spread that is keeping deals from being completed at the moment. Are you finding that some people who are seeking capital are ending up with more structured solutions, whether that's preferred equity, whether that's debt, rather than a traditional equity investment? Absolutely. The corporate debt markets have come up with some creative solutions that we have seen implemented more and more over the last few years. On the preferred equity or structured solutions, that is a very good tool to bridge some of this bid-ask spread. If you come in as a minority investor in a preferred position, you are more likely to be able to stretch on valuation, given that you're protected from your return standpoint. That is a trend that we've been hearing about, even since probably last year, but especially now with the new environment. I think that's something that we will be keeping an eye on. Obviously, CRCIB does a lot of work in the traditional renewables markets. Solar, wind, now batteries are becoming part of that, too. Are there any emerging technologies that you find interesting or that you've either been working on deals, have been looking at, or expect to have a breakout moment? Carbon capture. We have closed our first deal in that. We have several more in the pipeline that we are actively raising capital for, and that has become a very significant portion of CRC's focus and business. We have been very active in getting smart and up the curve on that industry. In addition, RNG is a growing sector that we have closed several deals in now, I think four or five to date, and continue to expect to see growth in that. Hydrogen has been a little more tricky, navigating the ins and outs of the various drivers of tax credits there, but that is one we certainly have an eye on. As you mentioned, storage, we now see as a core renewables technology. What is it about carbon capture that you think is interesting and is drawing this attention? It is a very exciting new technology that is being deployed. The credit component of it has been around in one form or another for many years, but we haven't actually seen a lot of projects deployed and utilizing that yet. So, there is the one that we've completed, there's several more in the pipe. Some of these are incredibly massive undertakings, where we're looking at multi-billion dollar projects, and that's a lot of tax credits and takes a lot of parties to be able to come together and monetize that and make this efficient. It's a huge opportunity set in front of us, it's a growing opportunity set, and one that we have been active in for years and are very poised to help navigate. And you mentioned the fact that you just closed your first deal. I don't know how much you can talk about that if it's been announced yet, but I'd be interested in hearing more either about the deal or about what it took to enter that sector as an advisor. So, we started looking at this sector almost five years ago because of existing legislation in place at the time, and that was updated and changed via the IRA, but a lot of these projects have been in development even longer than some of the renewables timelines that you see of three to five years. So, it takes a significant amount of patience and fortitude and kind of just continuous pressure to get these deals across the finish line. Very interesting. And do you think that this could be a breakout year for carbon capture? Are we going to start to see that grow? It does seem like between the incentives and maybe the need to find carbon renewal solutions, it just seemed like it's starting to be on people's radar. Yeah, we think so. We have it earmarked as a big part of our 2025. And you mentioned renewable fuels, renewable natural gas. Why is that interesting at this time? So, again, there is a tax credit component to that which plays very nicely in the traditional renewable tax equity investor and tax credit buyer space. So, we have started to see several of those deals start monetizing tax credits in 2024 and continue to expect that to expand in 2025. And then on the other end, you mentioned hydrogen. Hydrogen is something we've been writing about, we've been following for a long time, but it always feels like it's not quite at the point where it's investable or where it's on the verge of being investable. I don't know, maybe it fits into that bucket where you say it's the technology of the future and it always will be. What is holding back the hydrogen industry there? Do you think that there's potential for us to see more activity there? What do you think is stopping more deals from going forward? We have investors repeatedly reach out to us that they are looking to invest in hydrogen, that they want that to be a core component of their investment portfolio. They like the technology, they like the portfolio mix. And yet, when they actually start digging into the projects, there are challenges associated with green hydrogen versus blue hydrogen and what this all looks like and how the tax credits play out of any of that. And so I think for it to really expand, the market has to get a lot smarter. We need a lot more guidance and kind of understanding of how these projects come to fruition. That's not one that's super high on my list as far as 2025 expectations of rolling out, but certainly something of the future that we are keeping an eye on. The other technology that we hear a lot about, and really so far it hasn't fallen into the infrastructure bucket and we haven't paid a ton of attention to it, is nuclear technology. There's talk about small module reactors, something like that. I don't know if that's something that you'd consider a renewable form. Is that something you've spent any time on though? It is something we have looked at. We have not closed any deals in the space, but are in conversations, again, focused on the tax credit component. Once you're an expert in renewables tax credit financing, the IRA really expanded that to a lot of these other technologies. And it makes a lot of sense and has a lot of similarities. So we are in those conversations, not active on any transactions to date, but certainly evaluating that market. Now, we talked earlier in this conversation about a lot of the uncertainty, specifically when it comes to the political situation. I want to go a little bit more into that. I mean, what do you think investors are looking for? What could give people confidence? Is it what's going to happen in the first reconciliation bill if we see whether the IRA ends up on the chopping block? Is it going to be where the tax code ends up? Is it going to be what happens with these trade wars? I'm just a little bit curious what the main impetus is driving a little bit of the hesitation. There's just so many uncertainties out there that could impact this industry. Yeah, great question. From the top, right, the trade war, absolutely on people's mind, absolutely something of concern to infrastructure and project investors. However, also not new, right? We've been talking about tariffs on panels. Certainly tariffs on steel have been part of the conversation for quite a while. And so you'll find a lot of the equipment manufacturers and suppliers and project developers or builders have already worked this out in their contracts of the if-then clauses and the contingencies. Now, if things go dramatically different from expectations, you'll have a bunch of broken contracts and that'll need to be worked through. But in general, project developers have seen this coming and are trying to navigate it. And investors are requesting some degree of certainty around what this looks like, whether it's funds in contingency, whether it's contractual, etc. So we've worked through that with most of our clients and investors over the last years since the panel tariffs have been an issue. So that's not new. It is uncertainty, but it's not new uncertainty. On the tax policy side, I think the first draft of the bill will be very helpful to at least lay some benchmarks, have an idea. Are we talking full repeal? Are we talking scalpel versus sledgehammer taking to making tweaks in the IRA? And once we have that, I think the next thing that will be really critical is the initial responses, and specifically the initial responses from some of the red state senators in Congress, men and women who have historically been very supportive of these industries and supportive of the IRA and the benefits that their localities and constituents have received. So I think those will be two major talking points when that happens. The third is if there is a safe harbor provision. If there is a safe harbor provision that says IRA legislation applies for the next two to three years, that also gives people comfort on how to continue building the projects that are in process right now, and that those are not going to see some massive slash in returns due to this change in policy. Again, all of that are things we've dealt with in the past. And so those three things, I think, will be very telling in the upcoming months. Well, Britta, thank you for that. And we've covered a lot, still a lot more we could talk about, but I'm afraid that's all the time we have. Britta, thank you so much for coming onto the podcast. Of course. Thank you for having me. It's always great to have CRCI be on, and hopefully we'll have you or one of your colleagues on again in the future. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter and deputy managing editor for Infralogix North American News Coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today. Someone who's going to give us a close look at AI, surprise, surprise, emergence of retail colos move into grabbing some enterprise market share, of course, as you would expect, some financing trends, M&A, and more. I have with me managing director and head of digital assets for Harrison Street, Mike Hockenadel. Mike, how you doing today? Mike Hockenadel I'm doing great, Matt. Very happy to be here and looking forward to our conversation. Matt O'Brien Michael, I wanted to start the conversation. I think any conversation about data centers wouldn't be complete if we went over AI. I figured, let's just get that one over and done with right up front. When I was attending the PTC conference a couple of weeks ago in Honolulu, there was a lot of talk about AI adoption curves, where various industries stood with adopting that type of technology, or at least spending some money on studying the prospect of implementing those technologies and operations, IT systems and networks. We're all very familiar with what hyperscalers are working on. I was wondering if you can give us a holistic view, hyperscaler, enterprise, various different types of enterprises. Where do you see the AI adoption curve heading for enterprise use cases, let's say, over the next year or two? Mike Hockenadel Sure. A lot to unpack in that question. I think there's probably multiple things going on there, embedded within the question. It was interesting, you mentioned PTC earlier in the year. It came up in just about every conversation that I had over the course of the days that I was there, and obviously is a major factor driving the underlying demand for the market broadly. There was some big news that came out right after we were at the conference, which was unfortunate timing. It would have been fun if that news came out and we all had a chance to digest it in real time. I think the way that I think about AI is that from a commercialization standpoint, I see us at the very, very early stages in terms of how it's going to be adopted, how it's going to impact a variety of different markets, enterprise, retail, et cetera. But I think the one thing that is clear is that it will have profound implications across every category, both in terms of underlying data center infrastructure, in terms of connectivity, in terms of interconnection. And obviously, that's all on the data center and infrastructure side, which is where I spend my time. But beyond that, I think the impact is going to be profound more broadly in terms of the types of use cases, the types of applications, the ways that we interface with software and applications and compute generally. I think it's going to be incredibly profound and as profound as, say, the personal computer and the internet generally. But we're not even close to a point where we're starting to see kind of that broad adoption and commercialization. I think that some of the things that have come out, which I'm sure we'll get into in this conversation over the last two weeks, demonstrate that we're approaching an inflection point where I think it's going to accelerate that adoption. And it'll be exciting to see all of the different ways that the different systems that we interact with start to incorporate AI into their architecture. Interesting stuff, Michael. Thanks for that. I guess my follow-up to that one would be one of the themes that I was detecting, and people were telling me on the sidelines of the conference, is you see retail co-location firms kind of not filling a void, but becoming more prevalent in servicing the enterprise segment of AI-enabled facilities, cloud services. How do you see it? Do you see the retail colo? Is this really a big opportunity, their big moment here for addressing that market that seems to be gotten lost while we're all talking about the hyperscalers and the projects and data centers that we're seeing every day? Yeah, I think there are two things going on there that are happening in parallel and are somewhat independent of each other, but definitely should be viewed as kind of tailwinds to that category in that sector. I think the first relates to the fact that many operators are increasingly focused on catering to the hyperscale community exclusively, targeting larger requirements, in some cases even explicitly turning away smaller requirements out of a desire to preserve larger chunks of capacity to service the hyperscale community. That dynamic, I would say, has been going on for a couple of years now already and has definitely created an opportunity for retail co-location firms and enterprise kind of wholesale co-location firms. I would say layering on top of that is a second dimension, which kind of specifically relates to the conversation we were just having around AI adoption. And it probably is useful to just talk a little bit about the different types of AI compute and the different types of environments required to support that. So at a very, very high level within the context of AI, you have compute related to training, which is one type of environment and one type of infrastructure. And then you have the compute related to what's called inference, which is really the time where the model is actually interacting with the end users. So the compute environments for those two environments is very different. On the inference side, generally what is required is a slightly smaller capacity, highly connected and much more distributed. And so those types of environments are well suited for sort of edge style co-location data centers, which is creating additional tailwinds and benefiting many of the retail co-location providers. I think that's the category that we're just starting to see the beginnings of what I think could be profound growth and profound adoption. Because again, before some of the breakthroughs with chat GPT over the last 18 months, there was really no AI interfacing with retail end users. Now you're starting to see some, but when it becomes broadly adopted across markets, I think it's that inference piece where you could see some extraordinary growth, again, creating additional tailwinds for the category we're describing here. Right. And I think that dovetails nicely into my next question. Last week and a half, two weeks, people have been talking about deep seek. Obviously, I've been talking to people about that. People have been fearful or mindful if this may kind of not hit the pause button, but slow things down in terms from an investment perspective and capitalization perspective of facilities, data center facilities, power requirements, all the investments going into it. People kind of rechecking those models, right? But people told me to keep in mind, deep seeks more about inference, not so much a lot of the capital we're seeing going into more of the AI training oriented facilities. And keep in mind, over the last several years, Moore's law holds true that we've seen great efficiencies in various technologies, and that has not slowed down the data center and the strain it's built out. Again, just keeping that in mind. So what do you think? Do you think this is going to force executives to rethink their resource utilization models or something else? Again, a lot to unpack there. This was sort of the key news that would have been fun if it came out when we were all together at the PTC conference in Hawaii, because some of the statements were bold. I think it remains to be seen whether some of the claims are true or how complete they are. And then the reaction was obviously significant in terms of the public market reaction to some of the news. To start with, I think it's useful to digest and describe exactly what is claimed with some of the news that was released around DeepSeek and the latest model. I think fundamentally, their latest model, when it was released and people started interacting with it, it was very clear that it was a very good model. Probably not quite as good as some of the open AI models or other US-based competitors. But still good nonetheless. But I think the important part of the news was the claim that it was produced with somewhere order of magnitude, 1 20th to 1 30th of the amount of cost associated with the amount of underlying compute infrastructure required to train it. Again, I think not entirely sure how true that claim is. But even if it was produced with say half of the cost for the underlying compute, that's still a really meaningful development. And so we've been spending a lot of time over the last week or so since that news was released to digest exactly what we think that means relative to the market at large and how it sort of impacts our investment strategy. And I think where we've arrived is a couple of major takeaways that do in some ways really relate to elements of the conversation we've been having so far. And I think it's one of the reasons that I wanted to draw the distinction between training and inference kind of upfront because the implications across those two categories I think is profoundly different. I guess for starters, it's possible that you could come up with a sort of bear case, negative view around the impacts to training workloads and sort of the need for the amount of compute that's being developed to support training. It's possible that some of the techniques that are underpinning deep-seek start to proliferate. Maybe some of those techniques are incorporated into other models and collectively the players in the AI space recognize that they don't need to throw the amount of compute at the problem as originally anticipated. So I do think that is a possible outcome. Now in my mind, that specifically would impact the types of locations and projects that are solely focused on supporting AI training data. And so in my mind, again, that would be ultra-tertiary locations where data center development is taking place solely because of an ability to access large amounts of cheap power. To be honest, I think from a Harrison Street perspective, we had already kind of shied away from pursuing those types of investments. I think this is one piece of information that supports a view that it's a riskier long-term real estate and infrastructure investment because of those location characteristics. And this is the type of thing that could disrupt that. Now counter to that, if you look at the inference side of it, again, if these claims are true, it could be impacting the AI market broadly in two ways. I think one, it could be very democratizing. It could allow for many other players to compete against the incumbents and create models maybe better suited to certain tasks or create lower cost models that perhaps don't have the level of sophistication needed depending on the underlying use case. There's that democratization. And then also I think there will be, just by virtue of the cost implications, an acceleration of the commercialization of AI broadly. And you mentioned Moore's law, I think a very similar concept here that I'm not the first to say this, others have been saying this as well. But in this context, it's really Jevin's paradox, which would be, I think, how you could think about the impacts on the market, which is effectively that as a system or process or input becomes much more efficient and therefore much lower cost, it actually just dramatically accelerates adoption such that the underlying demand actually increases, which is somewhat counterintuitive. And so I definitely think that that will play out and will have a particularly significant impact on the inference side. Again, my view is that this dynamic generally is very bullish relative to the overall data center market, digital infrastructure, landscape generally, but it won't be evenly distributed I think there is a case to be made that it will support more certain locations over others. Thank you for that explanation, that was great. Speaking of deep seek and kind of the froth coming off the top in the publicly traded equity markets, we saw Nvidia took a little bit of a hit. I'm just wondering, what's your perspective on Nvidia's position in the AI value chain? I think there's still a key piece and a dominant player, and I don't think that changes at all with this news. Were they overvalued, probably? Were they due for kind of a healthy correction, perhaps? And I think it's true that it wouldn't have been possible for them to defend the pricing power that they had around their product in perpetuity. What's interesting though, is it wasn't necessarily a competitor that kind of chipped into that pricing power, but it was actually their own legacy products, which is kind of funny and in my mind actually speaks to the degree to which they're kind of outpacing their peers in terms of what they're producing right now. I don't see that changing. I think for the time being, they're going to continue to be the dominant player on the hardware side. They are a company of brilliant people that are driving the market here. They'll continue to innovate, and I suspect that they'll be able to maintain and defend their position for the time being. But in the short term, were they probably slightly overvalued? Sure. And even with a modest correction, I think you can look at their position and what they've been able to achieve, and it's pretty unprecedented across the market. Yeah, certainly impressive. So we were talking about AI adoption. Let's go over to the overall high-performance compute demand curve, where that stands, and what does that forebode for the industry overall? In general, it's driving significantly increased power densities. So I think that's one dimension to talk about. I think it's impacting the design of data centers. I would say there are increasingly sort of new use cases and new growth opportunities for the groups that have developed a strong capability around high-performance compute. I don't think every application that incorporates AI will fully need to take advantage of some of the power densities that are out there. But as inference proliferates, you will start to see ultra-high-density kind of high-performance compute installations in a very distributed kind of edge fashion. And there's room for some new technologies to emerge as part of that, and there are likely going to be some winners that are probably not yet on everybody's radar that are playing in that space. I also think that everybody's trying to figure out the optimal way to cool these environments. I think the other significant impact on the market right now is, is there something out there that we're not thinking about that's going to sort of change the paradigm in terms of what is currently one of the major constraints to operating in some of these ultra-high-dense environments, which is the ability to cool? It's a super-fluid environment, and it's interesting just to hear and talk about what some of the people are doing out there in the market from a power-density standpoint, because I still remember the first data center deal that I was involved in, which was in 2005. We were talking about a 5-megawatt total facility at 50 watts per square foot, and it bears almost no resemblance to where the market is today. I think this is one of the major areas that we're continuing to sort of push the envelope. Very, very little resemblance, but no, it's always good to recall the heyday of data centers. From the equity perspective, I want to get your take on financing markets for data centers, what you're seeing, what your take is on all the different avenues that operators are going down seeking debt financing. It seems like they have a lot of tools at their disposal now, ABS, private placements, typical bank loans, et cetera. What's your perspective on that? A lot of thoughts here. I think one of the most interesting takeaways from PTC this year was really two things. I think one was just the sheer volume of people attending this year. I've been going for many years. It used to be sort of a quaint, kind of clubby group. Everybody knew each other, and each year, it's just kind of snowballed. I think this year, there were close to 10,000 people there. It was conspicuous how many sort of new cohorts were there that hadn't attended previously. I think it's just indicative of the size of the growth of the data center market. We used to be sort of a niche alternative sector back in the day, very limited institutional capital, very limited liquidity on the debt side across all the categories. That's just no longer the case anymore. I think if you just look at the volume of growth doing somewhere in the neighborhood of say 20 to 30 billion of capital required per year to sort of support the growth that we're seeing, that's just North America. It's evolving out of a niche sector, and honestly, it's becoming one of the kind of core real estate and infra categories. As part of that, two things. I think a lot of capital, both debt and equity, has attracted this sector because they just see the demand fundamentals as being much stronger than the alternatives that they might be considering, particularly groups that may have historically had exposure to things like office and retail. We're seeing a significant rotation of capital looking for entry points into the sector. That's one dynamic, and so you're seeing that impact all of the different categories broadly. The other thing that's nuanced and different about the data center asset class is really two things. One, just the sheer size of the individual transactions. One development project is 700 million to a billion and can be more than that given the circumstances, particularly if it's a full turnkey build. It's very difficult, and I think on top of the size, it's a much more specialized level of understanding required and more operational intensity, so it's very hard for capital to find an entry point as the sole provider, whether debt or equity. It's given rise to a variety of techniques and structures to capitalize some of those projects out there. You mentioned on the debt side, the ABS market, for example. I think that's one of the techniques that we've seen a lot of groups go to, to be able to access very liquid and efficiently priced securitized debt generally once they have their project up and running with leases signed. It works great because for the most part, all of the underlying tenants and credit profiles supporting our sector are some of the best credits in the world, so we've seen that market emerge as one of the dominant markets on the debt side. It allows for broad syndication, so the ultimate investors that are taking a piece of those financings are able to digest a quantum of capital that makes sense in the context of their broader book. On the construction side, I think we've seen similar positive liquidity in that context. It's interesting because, and we've been active borrowers around some of our development projects, you've seen very strong liquidity across a broad category of lender groups. You've got traditional real estate mortgage lenders, you've got more kind of project finance oriented groups, and then you've got infrastructure groups. The techniques and structures start to blend a little bit and typically you're seeing club deals arranged or syndicated transactions, again, where each of the lender participants are able to size a quantum of exposure that makes sense relative to the balance of their book, but very strong liquidity and at spreads that are very, very reasonable relative to underlying risk profile. One thing that's interesting is private placement, you've started to see a little bit of a convergence of sort of the net lease world with the data center world. For reasons that make sense, I mean, a lot of the data center transactions are structured as single tenant transactions. Increasingly, the contracts are more real estate net leases and orientation rather than kind of turnkey gross leases like they have been historically. As I mentioned before, the tenant credit profile is very strong. You've seen net lease capital flow into the sector, probably a bit more on the equity side than the debt side. But I think the debt side from a net lease perspective historically has been oriented around slightly heavier amortization than I think other lender cohorts are able to provide right now. It makes the economics a little bit harder to justify, particularly given where risk-free rates are, going to the sort of ultra long-term end of the market right now is not necessarily the optimal spot on the yield curve, but definitely seeing strong liquidity coming from that net lease cohort on the equity side. And then I would say another technique that we've seen on the equity side, which is interesting and kind of hits on many of the themes that I've mentioned so far, is the dynamic of structuring and raising equity around a yield co. So it's basically a way to access long-term stabilized capital as an exit, but in a highly kind of structured and syndicated way. And again, for the equity investors, it allows for a group to buy a piece of a project that they find compelling without being required to assemble what could be 500 million of equity to buy a single transaction. Just to wrap things up, my last question for you, where and when can we expect to see Harrison Street show up in the day center industry next? Well, I would say we definitely will be doing more of what we have been doing. So I joined Harrison Street about five years ago. And at that point in time, we sort of set our strategy and kind of mapped out the plan for the future. Over the five years that I've been there, we've been executing against that strategy very successfully. I think we've committed about five and a half billion. We've started to see some realizations. And I would say we're having success with our kind of established partner network. So we will continue really across each of those dimensions. We're doing a lot of kind of campus scale development, mostly powered shell and mostly in service of the hyperscale community. We're doing that successfully across Northern Virginia and a variety of different submarkets. We will definitely be doing more kind of building on and augmenting that position. Similarly, we have ongoing projects in the Dallas market, in the Reno market, in the Cheyenne, Wyoming market. Cheyenne's kind of an interesting one. It's sometimes off people's radar, but there's exceptionally strong connectivity in Cheyenne. It's sort of one of those markets along Interstate 80 where there's a high density of fiber. And many of those markets have emerged as sort of interesting hyperscale cluster markets. We'll continue to pursue those strategies in addition to some of the things that we're doing on kind of the campus development side. You know, interestingly, kind of circling back to the start of this conversation, we do still have an interest in co-location. We've found that we're having success, you know, catering to some of those enterprise customers that have been sort of squeezed out of the larger end of the wholesale market, you know, by virtue of cloud. But there are definitely still a lot of requirements out there that need a dedicated physical environment that are not well-suited to go into, you know, full cloud solutions. And so we continue to focus on that sector. I would say, you know, for us, having a compelling story around connectivity is really important in that business. And then we love interconnection. So we have a portfolio of carrier hotels that we want to, you know, add to strategically, you know, over time. You know, carrier hotels are very nuanced, unique assets. There's clearly not the volume, you know, in that category that there is, you know, on the development side. It's just such an important and strategic piece within the overall application, you know, architecture. And so I would say big picture, you know, we're going to continue to execute against our strategy in each of those categories. And then we also have a business in Europe, a little bit newer than our business in the U.S., but you'll start to see us investing out of our various buckets of capital earmarked for Europe, I would say, in the coming year as well. Great. Thank you. I want to thank you for taking some time out today for our listeners. Really interesting stuff. We'll be keeping an eye on Harrison Street and your guys' future endeavors in the sector. So please keep us apprised of the ongoing projects that you guys are working on. Thanks a lot, Bat. I enjoyed it. I would like to thank our listeners for tuning into this week's podcast. Don't forget to like, subscribe and share. Well, that's it for this week. Don't forget to tune in next week. Until then, take care.

I'm your host, Gene Gilligan. My guest today is Andris Sakristan, CEO of Sintra, a Ferrovial company. Andris leads the company's $11 billion investment portfolio of five managed lanes projects in Texas, Virginia, and North Carolina. Today Andris will talk about what is needed to make these managed lanes projects successful and what the prospect is for continued managed lanes development in the US. Welcome Andris, and thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Gene, for having me here in this podcast. First question I have, when you speak to State Department of Transportation officials, what is your argument for instituting managed lanes projects? What are the benefits of these projects? Well, managed lanes is a solution. Basically, the DOTs of different states may have problems with traffic congestion, and they don't have infinitive resources. They don't have the space in the corridors to build limited number of lanes. They don't have the budget for doing so. So the managed lane solution solves both problems. They create this additional capacity, and they create this additional capacity with P3 procurement, which is private investment. This is the very bare bone ingredients of our solution. But at the end, what we provide with this additional capacity is a solution to the communities we serve. They enable their lifestyle, they can go to their place in a reliable time, in a safer way. That's what we try to convince the DOTs, and try to make it possible when many others have told them that it was impossible to solve, or to increase capacity, or to reduce their travel times. We come with this solution, integrated, both from the engineering side and from the financial side. That's what we try to propose, and what we try to make this happen, and so far, we created some market in the U.S. What do managed lanes need from an operations and maintenance perspective to keep them operating well? Well, managed lane is a product at the end of the day to the users. What we promise then is a value proposition that has three legs, let's say. One is time saving, so it needs to be free flowing all the day, no matter the time of the day or the conditions, weather conditions. Secondly, is reliability. You don't need to prepare for these 10 minutes, 20 minutes ahead of the time of your appointment just in case. You know that the time it takes you to get there is going to be the same every day at any condition. And finally, we offer a better safety record in our corridors. Our corridors are, in average, around 40% safer than the rest of the corridors in the area. So all this value proposition is what we really offer to the users. Once the user notice that and keep using the managed lane and we keep growing in the number of users, the community is happy and the DoT is happy with the solution. So operating is just to keep the road super well maintained, keep the traffic flowing, and that's the two main drivers of the product quality we offer. How have your U.S. managed lanes been performing? Well, they've been performing quite well. I mean, we had, like everybody else, a huge bump during 2020 due to the pandemic. But since then, they rebound back 60% over that level. And now we are growing, as I said before, in the number of users, traffic levels year over year. Every year we just finish 2024 with good numbers. We will make them public shortly. They're performing well because they are based on a quality product. As I said before, we enable people's lives. Also users are super clever. So they are not using managed lane every day. They understand which is the trip for them, which is important, and which is the day that they need to use them. And the vast majority of our users uses the managed lane three to five times a month. They are not every day, twice or three times. There are some of them that they do, but the vast majority, they are not that regular. And it's because they see the value on certain trips, on certain trips that are important for them because they go to a baseball practice with the kids and medical appointment. And other trips that are not that important for them, so they don't choose the managed lane. So I think that that's a great solution to provide that quality service. And the users are super smart in choosing when to use them. And you say you've seen a surge in the use of managed lanes post pandemic. Yes. General mobility went back. One of the traffic congestion started to rise, 2021 still not, but 2022, 23, and for sure 24 is back to normal and on over pre-pandemic levels. And users are appreciating that quality and that reliability and that they are using them every other day. So we grow in all the corridors and I think that the value proposition is super good for the users and is growing. The value of time with economic growth, population growth, congestion and growth around our projects is growing every year as well. So that's because the usage is also growing. Tennessee recently launched a procurement for its first managed lanes P3, and we've seen managed lanes development in Southern and Mid-Atlantic States, such as Georgia and North Carolina, Virginia. Do you think we'll see development of managed lanes projects in other regions of the U.S.? I think so, and we work for that to happen. I think that our business development team for sure is focused on these opportunities you mentioned, but also is focused on making proposals to other states to their traffic congestion problems. The two main things we find when we start conversations with DODs is for sure a traffic congestion problem existing or about to happen, and also areas with a high potential for economic growth and population growth. These are the problems that the states need to tackle, and we try to propose solutions and solutions that with other thinking or widening lanes from our traditional infrastructure solutions that were not physical space. We came with our engineering colleagues from construction, and we propose innovative solutions that fit in the corridors, fit in the right of way the states has for that project, and we made that happen. Very good. We're seeing so much talk these days about new types of transportation, autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles. What are managed lanes developers doing to make their projects adaptable to this new transportation technology? Innovation is a constant on Ferrovial and in Sintra, and we will be trying to bring that quality in terms of the product I mentioned before, and the quality and that reliability came before with having a pricing algorithm that prices the managed lane usage every five minutes so we adapt to the conditions of the traffic. And now with this new wave of vehicles, autonomous vehicles that are coming, we also put in the market a product called IVEA that basically put and deploy sensors along the road so we can have a dialogue with those autonomous vehicles to understand the conditions of the traffic, incidents on the road, what could happen if there is any object or any accident or anything. We can communicate with those autonomous vehicles in advance to get a signal that the hazard is ahead of them. So all these projects are orchestrated in our control rooms. We made a test, we made a trial in our I-66 project in Virginia, and we have a demo room that many people visited from the U.S. DOT to many other states' DOTs, and when the fleet of autonomous vehicles will be there ready for that handshake with infrastructure, we are ready basically. Very good. We're certainly hearing more about this, and I think you're optimistic about managed lanes development in the U.S., is that correct? Yeah, I'm optimistic because I think that many cities are growing, population is moving to cities, cities need to provide infrastructure to that growth, and we are here to help basically to be part of the solution. Great. Very good. Well, Andres, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. It was really educational, and I appreciate you taking the time to talk about managed lanes with us. It's something we've been following pretty closely at Infralogic, and I'm sure we'll continue to. Thank you, Jim, for having me here. It's been a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you for listening to Crossroads.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-01-30 23:48:44+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### IDB's Infrascope Discusses Advances in Latin American PPPs\n**Episode ID:** 4412\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. I am Eva Llorens, senior reporter for Latin America at InfraLogic. Our guests first today are from the Inter-American Development Bank. Our first guest is Gaston Artesiano, head of public-private partnerships, One Stop Shop in the infrastructure and energy sector at the Inter-American Development Bank, where he has been since 2007. He has also a law degree from Catholic University in Argentina. Meanwhile, our second guest is Maria Pilar Castrozin, senior associate at IDB, where she works at the IDB PPP, single window with focus on the development and strengthening of regulatory and institutional frameworks for the implementation of PPPs. She is also a published author of two PPP books. Today, we will be talking about InfraScope, a tool developed by the IDB related to the development of PPPs. Welcome all of you to our podcast. Thank you very much, Eva, for inviting us today. It's a pleasure for us to talk about the InfraScope. It's a flagship publication for the Inter-American Development Bank. And Mr. Gaston Artesiano, I'm going to start with you. First of all, what is InfraScope and what is the objective of InfraScope? The InfraScope is an index developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Economist Impact to make a diagnostic of the enabling environment for the development of efficient and sustainable public-private partnerships in economic and social infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Inter-American Development Bank and the Economist Impact have different roles in this endeavor. On one hand, the methodology was developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Economist Impact together. This is an index that has also been applied to other regions in the developing world. And through different years, we have been enhancing the methodology and we have different roles in this two-year work we do for the InfraScope. During the implementation of each edition, together with the Economist Impact, we work together. Our partner collects the information and we are the guardians of the methodology and that the methodology is used according to how it was aimed to be. So first, the methodology design following international best practices, which is the most important part for us in order to be able to gather evidence on the application and the implementation of these best practices. And then the analysis of the reality of every single country business environment, which differs from not only the legal and the institutional arrangements, but also by their own experience in attracting private sector investment to the infrastructure sector. I'm going to go with you, Pilar. Could you provide specifics about this new website? Sure. Thank you so much for the question, Eva. This new edition of the InfraScope that we presented in October last year includes also a new website. This new website provides a much more friendly and interactive experience for the user. The user will have access to the highlights of the key findings of the report. This is a report that has the original results for the 26 countries that we evaluate. And of course, you can download this report, but also you're going to have some highlights there where the user can interact with. The user also can interact with the ranking of the new edition, highlighting each country and seeing the details for each category score and ranking. Also, the user can highlight, for example, one country, which not only shows the results for the index for this edition, but also the country summary with information about the macroenvironment, the PPP investment per sector, an overview of the PPP market and the different regulatory developments and performance across the index, plus a new section that all these countries have this year that is the top five recommendation for improvement, which is very useful to guide policymakers in what they can do to improve their enabling environments for the preparation of PPPs. Another interesting feature is the website. In the website is the recent progress section where you can see the evolution of the index in the last two editions. So the last two editions shared the same methodology. And now in this website, you can compare these two editions and highlight the countries and see overall scores or the results for each category. And finally, as in previous editions, the user will also have access to download, as I said, the key finding report, the methodology appendix and the data book to go deeper into the result of the index. Pilar, would you explain briefly the criteria used for this study? Sure. Yeah. The criteria that we use here in the Infrascope is that the index is filled with qualitative and quantitative metrics. And these are organized in five categories. First we have regulation and institutions. Second one is project preparation and sustainability. Third, financing, risk management and contract monitoring. And finally, a new category that is incorporated for the first time in the past edition, performance evaluation and impact exposed. Could you provide an example as to how this will work when you select a country so that it's clear for our listeners? Sure, of course. So in regulations and institutions, the index is going to be focused on finding a mandate. This is finding, for example, a policy or a law that allows a country to implement PPP type of contracts, public-private partnerships or concessions. So that's the first part of regulations. Also these regulations will have details about how the institutions that needs to be created specific for the treatment of PPPs or the institutions, for example, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs that need to control, for example, the liabilities of the type of project generate. So these laws, this policy will explain in detail all the process that needs to be followed to identify and prepare a PPP project, how these projects should be put in the market through a public and international bidding process and so on. The second category, the project preparation and sustainability here is focused on doing a summing in the preparation of the project. So you will see how the project is selected, if there is methodologies to apply to each con project, if this is consistent with different projects in different sectors, how these projects are selected, how these projects are evaluated to see if the PPP modality is the best in each case on each project. And finally, all the studies that are needed from the technical point of view, the legal point of view, the social and environmental point of view. And here in this category, the index also add focus on sustainability, on social considerations, on inclusion, on consultations with communities, risk of disasters and so on that are related with the sustainability in the long term of the contract. Then when you go to financing, here the index evaluate different type of finances that I use in PPP contracts. One that is very typical is project financing, but also there are other modalities that can be implemented. So the index evaluate and see which countries implement what kind of financing and also this category has a big component on macro-economic characteristics of the country that also affects the ability of the country to prepare projects and to put projects in the market and these projects have a probability to be successful. Then related to risk management and contract monitoring, this is a very important, also together with project preparation, very important category that is not only a requirement for the countries to evaluate and assess the risk present in each project and assess how this risk should be allocated between the public and the private party, but also that this is reflected correctly in the contracts. And of course, another part that is also very important for success of a PPP is the contract monitoring. During the life cycle of a PPP project, of course you have the private sector that will have a lot of responsibilities, but the public sector has also a lot of responsibilities and here it's very important that the public sector has the capacities and the necessary methodologies and tools to do a proper monitoring of the contract. And finally, the last category is performance evaluation and impact exposed. This is a category that we will see after the results, but here we are trying to see if the countries are evaluating the projects once those projects are being operative or finalized to see if the objectives that the project had were accomplished or not and how we can extract lessons learned for those past projects for the future generation of projects. So it's very important also to keep working on this category. Thank you very much, Mrs. Castro-Singh. I'm going to go back to Mr. Asteciano. Could you elaborate on the main findings of the study, Mr. Asteciano? Yes, of course. Thank you, Eva, for such an important question. As we can see over the years, we have been expanding the countries we are making the diagnostic and we have been moving from almost the entire region to the full 26 member countries of the IDB. As we move along, we see more and more interest in implementing transactional PPPs in the region. Most of the countries have already approved specific laws, which have been already sometimes enhanced with new, let's say, institutional devices that allow a more successful implementation of the PPPs. And together with the sophistication of the PPP market in Latin America, we have been sophisticating also the analysis of the business environment. We have been along since 2020 with new categories, as Pilar was mentioning, and to expanding to social infrastructure, focusing more in sustainability and environmental and social issues regarding infrastructure projects, and also long-term monitoring and exposed evaluation. This last edition also have included five case studies, and these case studies are meant to identify success stories and to generate a body of knowledge and evidence on how successful PPPs are implemented from the countries that are more advanced and also for the newcomers. So this new edition has case studies in the enabling environment for the case of Jamaica, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru. Okay, let me ask, go back to Pilar, what are some of the challenges that different countries have to overcome to be able to do more public-private partnerships? Thank you for the question, Eva. As I was mentioning, the index has a key finding report, and based on this key finding report, this report explains as a region, on average, what are the several areas where we can find room for improvement. I can mention, for example, one area that several countries need to work, and it is improving the capacities of the institutions involved in the process of identification, preparation, and procurement of public-private partnership projects. Just to mention, of the 26 countries that are evaluated in the index, just half of them have PPP units. This is institutions that has the task to centrally overview the development of PPPs in the country with the right capacity. So just half of the 26 countries have these units with the right capacities. So that is an area that, as a region, will be good to keep working on. Another one that is important is the efficiency of the project preparation, and this can be measured as the share of tendered public-private partnerships reaching financial close every year. And this number, that is around 60%, has been the same in the edition 2021 and in this new edition that takes data from 2023 to 2024. And here, there are several reasons, but I would like to focus on one that I was also mentioning when I was explaining the categories, that is the lack of clear and consistent planification that affects the preparation of the projects. So it's lack of clear and consistent planification, lack of methodologies for prioritization, PPP projects, lack of inclusion of sustainability criteria, and considerations in selection and preparation of public-private partnerships. So there is a lack of methodologies in general that, together with the lack of capacities that I was mentioning in the first point, makes that the preparation of projects still has a lot of room for improvement in the region, and it's an area that all the countries should keep working. Also, the area of evaluation of impact and performance is an area that most of the countries doesn't have an institution that takes care of this. The regulations around PPP doesn't ask for the institutions to perform this type of studies, so it's a missing opportunity here of learning from the past experiences and incorporating the lessons learned to the future project. And finally, and I mentioned a little bit about this, but it's the incorporation of sustainability criteria in the PPP frameworks and also in the PPP contracts as well. Here we are talking about social inclusions, environmental inclusions, also inclusion itself of different groups that needs to be represented in the preparations, the preparation of the project and included in the benefits that this project brings to the communities. Thank you very much. This question is for Mr. Astesiano, but Pilar, you can also contribute. I just wanted to know if you have any predictions as to what we can expect to see in terms of the use of public-private partnerships, perhaps based on what you have already done. Maybe if you can talk about which countries do you expect to be able to do better or worse. If you can elaborate a little, whatever you can say, I would appreciate it very much. Let's start with you, Mr. Astesiano. Thank you very much, Eva. We have been witnessing as a trend in the region. We see a region with an infrastructure gap in investment and maintenance and PPPs, when well implemented, are a very efficient tool for not only attracting private capital and management to infrastructure assets and services, but also optimizing the investment envelope of the countries for infrastructure and in that way, helping to bridge that infrastructure gap that our region is facing to actually reach the Sustainable Development Goals. What we have been seeing is a region that has been expanding the use of the tool, not only to new markets. For example, in last years, we have seen an increase in the Caribbean by 14% since the last edition, and we expect that trend to continue in new editions. And that has meant $160 billion new investment in projects, which is a 25% increase, reaching 650 projects in the entire region. We see a trend that from 2014 to 2023 has grown 25%, and it has the potential to keep growing in those levels. Another trend I would say we are witnessing is an increase of different countries creating or pursuing PPP programs. Here is very important the word programs, and this is not a one-off project, but rather a public strategy, a public policy strategy to attract the private sector to a particular sector or to a particular infrastructure service to mobilize private capital to those sectors. We are seeing new dynamic programs in Panama, in Paraguay, upstream work in Costa Rica, in Belize, in Ecuador. So we are confident that this trend will consolidate. We for example, are also seeing the most developed programs in the region like Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, moving to new sectors. We are seeing a higher demand or a higher application of PPP models to the health sector. This was very, very present during and after the COVID-19 pandemic where we saw how the lack of availability of beds in the public hospitals was one of the bottlenecks to treat the pandemic. And since that, we have worked together with Peru in two hospitals, Pura and Chimbote, but Chile has successfully awarded a very large program, 18 hospitals. And we are working together with several states in Brazil in that area. This is probably a sector that will grow and we will be able to be replicated by new countries. For example, Colombia is considering to expand to the social sector as well. Also another sector that has been growing in very particular countries is the water and sanitation sector. The water and sanitation sector is a sector that has a very large infrastructure gap to reach the sustainable development goal. And with the new sanitation regulatory framework in Brazil, we see a lot of demand and appetite for the private sector to participate. We together with ProInversión were able to award the water treatment plant for the municipality of Chincha three weeks ago. And this is part of a program of seven water treatment plants in Peru where we are working together with ProInversión. So I would say these trends of new countries implementing programs, new sector in the well-established programs and more appetite from the public sector to mobilize private capital is here to stay. And that's why a tool like the Infrascope provides fantastic evidence on what are the best practices and what are the key of success and what are the lessons learned from the more advanced countries to feed back into the newcomers.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest today is Jonah Goldman, Head of External Affairs and Impact for Generate Capital. And in that position, Jonah is focused on regulatory and policy engagement. Jonah, thank you for coming on to the pod. Oh, thank you so much for having me, Andrew. I'm happy to be here. So we are recording this on January 21st, the day after President Trump's inauguration. And we planned it like that because Jonah is very focused on the impact of policy and regulation on the energy industry. What I didn't expect was that just 24 hours into his presidency, President Trump would have already made such an impact and so much news when it comes to the energy sector, including issuing a spate of executive orders, one of them declaring a national energy emergency, several others. And we're going to get into all of that today. But before we dive in, Jonah, can you tell me a little bit about Generate Capital? Absolutely. We think of ourselves as the capital partner for the infrastructure transition. What that means to us is we feel like the transition is going to be built asset by asset, and we are deeply focused on assets. And in that, we do three things. We build, own, and operate projects, so actual projects that are delivering clean energy to people around the country. And then we also build, own, and invest in companies. And those companies are also project-oriented. They're project development companies. They own and operate assets as well. And then we provide credit to projects and companies that are focused on assets. So we really are kind of at the leading edge of many of these conversations. Our investments span a very large swath of technologies. So we do power production and clean energy production. We have investments in transportation. We have investments in waste to value. We have investments in industrial decarbonization. We invest in a broad array of projects and opportunities. I know that readers of InfraLogic are very familiar with Generate Capital. Your name comes up a lot in our publication. One of the most active firms in the renewables space, at least in the North American region. And Jonah, what's your role with the firm? So I lead a couple parts of the firm. I lead external affairs, which is largely our regulatory and policy engagement with policymakers at all different levels, at the federal level, at the state level, and at the local level. I also lead our communications activities. We have a thought leadership platform called Generate Intelligence, where we help reflect on our experience investing and building these assets. I also lead our impact strategies. Our impact strategies are both how we judge our impact. We're a public benefit corporation, which means that we have a dual fiduciary obligation. One is to, of course, our shareholders, and that is a priority, as well as to the communities that we engage with, which is largely our commitments to sustainability, to the resource revolution, and as well as to, again, the health and wellness of the communities that we serve. And so I lead an effort to not only assess that, but also to evaluate how we can invest more effectively by increasing the impact that we have within these different verticals. And Jonah, what is your background in this industry? How long have you been at Generate? I've been here for just over a year. Before I was here, I did a short stint at BCG, where I was lucky enough to work with a bunch of colleagues on a number of different projects in this area. And then before that, I built Breakthrough Energy with Bill Gates. So I was employee zero and worked with Bill from the very beginning on the strategy, as well as on the raising of funds, and then all of our work with policymakers, all of our work leading up to the IRA, all of our work in building a number of different programs. So not only our investment vehicles and policy vehicles, but our fellows program, as well as a program that we call Catalyst, which is a project finance vehicle. That's very interesting. I never knew that, Jonah. And sounds like a really interesting career leading up to this point. And you'll have to get Bill to come on this podcast next. Put in a word for me. Well, we'll see. Well, as mentioned, Jonah, your focus has been, at least in large part, on following what's going on in the policy world. So I know it's only been less than 24 hours since a lot of these executive orders were issued. But we had a really active day yesterday. President Trump issued executive orders that paused disbursements coming from the Inflation Reduction Act, that paused offshore wind lease actions, that also seemed to target onshore wind, and of course, declared an energy emergency that seemed to kind of leave out renewables as a potential solution. So Jonah, what do you make of the first 24 hours of the Trump presidency from an energy standpoint? Well, it was certainly jam-packed, which I think people were somewhat caught off guard with, but was very consistent with what President Trump has been saying throughout the transition. And these moves were generally expected. And like pretty much every incoming administration, the first day, the first hours of the administration are often ways to demonstrate more the direction that the policymaking apparatus will go rather than really having, like, immediate impact. Some of the pieces of the IRA, most of those dollars have been distributed. So there isn't that much left in the agencies, but it's symbolic and symbolism is important here. I mean, it's important to see how these agencies are likely to execute their authority under this new administration. And I think President Trump gave a clear sign again. I think that sign was consistent with what he's been saying throughout the campaign and certainly in the transition. Even from a regulatory perspective, so even in the pieces of the policymaking apparatus where the president has the most authority, a lot of these things are processes. And those processes are long and they're drawn out and they're often fraught by decisions that were made by previous administrations and by limitations put on by Congress and by realities of the market. But again, I think that he made very clear that basically the promises that he made during the campaign are the promises he intends to keep as president. Adamantium It's interesting. I mean, you say this was expected and I think some of it certainly was. But for example, I expected him to go after offshore wind. I think that as long as I've been talking to people in this sector about the prospect of a Republican administration, they've been saying that offshore wind was probably most at risk. But it seems like onshore wind is also in the crosshairs. Did that surprise you at all? He's certainly been saying things about his feelings about onshore wind for a while, which are not positive. You know, the truth is, is that wind is a deeply powerful resource in the country and it's largely powerful in red states. So Iowa gets a majority of its power from wind power. Other states along that kind of Midwest wind corridor are red states that derive a lot of power that is relatively affordable from wind. So, you know, those things we'll see what the impact is. Again, I think that he's been very clear that wind is the renewable resource that he finds most kind of anathema to his priorities. And he made that clear once again, once again yesterday. Now, again, it's important to note that executive orders have limited authority compared to actual regulatory processes that need to happen. And so we're gonna see, again, as you said, Andrew, at the top of the podcast, like there was so much that happened yesterday. So digesting what it all means and what the impact is and what the executability of some of these things are, you know, those things are very difficult to judge at this moment, less than 24 hours after these things came down. But these processes are often much, much more involved to be able to, you know, revoke licenses on federal lands, to be able to halt development of projects that already have, you know, notices to proceed and that are already invested by both private and public players. I mean, these things are much more difficult than just, you know, a stroke of the pen in the Oval Office. But he's made clear what his targets are. And again, they don't seem terribly different than what we heard over the last number of months. Well, that's very true. And obviously, there is a lot to digest. What do you make of his declaration of a national energy emergency? Now, in theory, I'd think that this would be, could be a benefit for renewables if it expedited permitting. I know that's been something that's on the sector's mind for a while. But it seems like this national emergency declaration kind of leaves renewable sources of generation out of the conversation. What did you make of that? I honestly don't know what it means yet. I'm not sure that any of us know what it means. I don't know that the administration knows exactly what it means. President Trump was very clear that he has an intention of reducing energy prices. And this was one of the steps. Again, a lot of these things are more politically directional than they are actually policy-oriented impact. And this may be one of those things. And the truth is, is that the market is going to largely determine what resources are developed based on what the needs are of the various different grids that we have in the country and the demand that comes from both all of us as Americans, as well as the sectors that we support through all the work that needs to get done in the country. And those are probably the dominant forces. And those forces tend to really like cheap power, and they really like cheap clean power. And so, in that case, I think you have renewables standing on a pretty strong footing. I think that President Trump understands that there is a reliance already on the grid on some of these resources, and there is a lot more in the pipeline coming. And to the extent that we can withstand significant power demand over the next five to 10 years, certainly over the course of his administration, we need as many electrons on the grid as we can get. And frankly, wind and solar are doing a great job of providing those electrons. I mean, we saw for the first time that upstream oil and gas development fell below renewable development. I think it was sometime last year, the S&P just released a study on it. And those are trends that are dominated by people who are actually putting money into projects. And that's really where we're gonna see demand. I know that President Trump is not interested in raising power prices. And the truth is, is that if you curtail renewable development, if you curtail the ability of wind and solar to come on the grid, if you can curtail other types of clean energy opportunities, which the administration is very supportive of, like nuclear, geothermal, those sorts of things, power prices go up. There's less...you know, fewer electrons mean that power prices are gonna go up. And that's not something that this administration is at all interested in. And one theme we've been talking about for the last year, at least, is just the increasing need for power with the rise of artificial intelligence and the infrastructure, including data centers that's needed to support that. If you forecast the next decade, it just seems like there's gonna be the demand for the need for more energy than there has been in a very long time. It seems like it would be crazy to take any possible generation source off the table. Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, you know, the United States is out of practice with adding capacity to our grid. And we have an aging grid that makes it very difficult for us to do it. We have permitting obligations that are very, very difficult for developers and project builders to build quickly. And I think that this administration understands that and hopefully will relieve some of those pressures. It's out of practice. We haven't done this for a long time. It's been, you know, it's been a few decades since we've had meaningful low growth. It's not that we've never done it, but it's been a while. But the name of the game is increased electrons. The name of the game is increased cheap electrons. And renewables actually fulfill both of those opportunities, as well as, of course, preventing or at least delaying the worst impacts of climate change. And so, and when you think about that, when you think about the impacts of climate change so often, they're talked about in the context of, you know, these sort of political obligations on one side or the other. From an investment perspective and from a kind of real economy perspective, you know, climate change is the most value destructive force we've ever seen. And investors don't like value destruction. They like value creation. And so the more that we can do to prevent that value destruction, you know, the deep, deep tragedy that's happening in Southern California that's continuing ongoing in Southern California is just the latest example of that. And the more that we can preserve the value, the more that we can create value instead of destroy it, the more likely we are to be able to successfully compete in a global economy, the more that we are able to build the things that Americans rely on in order to live the lives that we all hope that we can lead. And in those cases, you take the politics out of it. And when you take the politics out of it, you know, renewables actually fare quite well. Again, they're cheap, they're getting cheaper, and they're super powerful. And that, I think, is ultimately, you know, economics often ultimately make the final decision. Politics maybe make the first one, but economics makes the last one. Adam, that's definitely very interesting. And one of the factors, one of the big spurs to making renewables affordable in the last few years has been the Inflation Reduction Act. And even if you take a step back from the last 24 hours, that has been the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was President Biden's climate legislation that created or extended all these incentives for renewable and other clean technologies. The fate of the Inflation Reduction Act has been, I'd say, the biggest focus for investors in this space when it comes to the potential of a Trump presidency. I think the consensus, the wide consensus, has been that it's unlikely that the IRA will be either repealed or really gutted, and that any changes would be kind of around the edges. But there's some uncertainty about that. I'm curious how you affirm and how you're looking at that. Yeah. Listen, elections have consequences, and those consequences are often felt at the legislative level, and they will be felt this time. The rumors of the death of the IRA, as you suggested, are overblown. And the IRA has provided huge value to communities across the country. And those values are what often motivates political decision-making, certainly in the House. And we have this strange sort of reverse dynamic that we normally do politically, where normally the Senate is so much closer with so much more power from an individual member than the House is. We're sort of reversed. We are reversed in this Congress. And so what that means is that the local benefits of these projects and these programs are going to be much more determinative, I think, of how we move forward with policy. And in that case, I think that there certainly will be marginal changes to the IRA. In fact, I think if we had a continuation of the policies of the Biden administration, there would be an effort to go back and to try to adjust the policies of the IRA, obviously, in a different direction than this administration would be. But we're constantly iterating on policy, and this is no exception. I think that what direction those adjustments move in have, again, a lot to do with where there's money deployed, people working, construction happening, power being provided to the grid. So these things, these, like, actual tangible pieces of the puzzle end up being the thing that's gonna likely have members standing up for to defend particular provisions or deciding that they're not worth risking political capital on. If you look at that equation, then I think that there are parts of the IRA that look really good. I think that there are parts of the IRA that have delivered value to communities. I think that those things are already here, evidence of those things being supported by members. You know, this is gonna be a messy process. It always is. It particularly is when you have close margins. So we're not sure exactly what it's gonna look like. I think that there will be continued incentives to build out renewable energy in the country. I think those incentives hopefully are bankable for investors like us. But when we think about it at Generate, you know, we think about the fact that projects aren't in the United States. Projects are in particular communities, in particular states that are in the United States. And we sort of think of it that way. So if we think that the economics of a particular project are gonna work out, that's how we're evaluating that investment. And of course, the federal incentives help us in that case, but they're not the only things and often the policy that's most relevant to the way that projects are being developed and the value that those projects are gonna be able to bring back to communities are actually more localized policies. So whether that's state policy or local policy, and we continue to track that very, very deep. But I do think that there will continue to be federal incentives to build out these types of projects. It's interesting. And I would also encourage listeners, if you haven't already, to go back and listen to my conversation with former FERC Chairman Richard Glick, because we talked a lot about this, about the prospect of what will happen to the IRA. I think this was recorded in October before the election, but we talked about what would happen if Trump were to become president. And there's been a lot of talk about 18 Republican members of Congress signed a letter saying, don't repeal these incentives for clean energy with normal political horse trading. There's no guarantee that all 18 of those members would stand firm, but you do have to think given how narrow Republicans' advantage in the House is, that if even just two or three or a small amount stand in the way, that could make it impossible to have huge changes to the IRA. But I guess that's something we're gonna see in the coming months. And I also think, in a way, just the uncertainty might have an impact on the industry itself. Absolutely. Our CEO, Scott Jacobs, just wrote a sort of open letter to the community where he says that uncertainty and infrastructure investing are poor bedfellows. So uncertainty is always something that we are trying to resist against, especially when your goal is building assets that live for decades. So immediate political uncertainty sometimes can scuttle those efforts. And I think that we are living in a particularly uncertain environment, and I think that you have and will continue to see capital markets respond to that. So we've talked a lot today about some of the threats and challenges to the industry in light of the new administration and the changes that are gonna come with it. But are there also opportunities? And where are you looking for those opportunities? And where will the industry be looking for them? First, from the types of assets that we tend to invest in, there are certainly opportunities. There are opportunities because customers are demanding cleaner and more reliable ways to power their businesses. So obviously, AI, we've already talked about, and many of those hyperscalers continue to be committed to building out clean energy infrastructure alongside the AI infrastructure. And there's great opportunities, and those opportunities are across the board. There's technology development opportunities, there's opportunities for mixing technologies into multi-technology solutions to provide reliable and affordable and clean energy that powers the AI revolution. When you sort of take a step back and you think about where we are in the energy transition, where we are with climate and with the industrial transition, there's a few things that we're desperately in need of. And those things seem to be things that this administration is quite supportive of. So the most capital-intensive pieces of this are advancing and building out a new nuclear infrastructure, for example. Absolutely critical. It's critical no matter which direction you're taking it from. It's critical if you just want more electrons on the grid, because you have a very reliable and scalable way to be able to provide those electrons. It's incredibly important from a climate perspective. I mean, once you start getting to really high penetration of renewables, there are very few other types of resources that are able to be sited anywhere in the country that will provide non-intermittent electrons. And so you see some really interesting stuff happening from an innovation perspective. The administration seems to be supportive of hydrogen. And in some ways, one of the problems that was a struggle with the IRA and with the deep commitments to hydrogen was a real sort of tension between whether we're building a hydrogen economy or we're building a clean hydrogen economy, and those two things aren't the same. And this administration seems pretty intent on supporting things like hydrogen. And there's certainly an argument, I have to say, I fit into this category, where it's most important for us to first build a hydrogen economy, and then that economy is relatively easy to grow. It's an identical molecule, no matter how you produce it. And we do not have that infrastructure now. We don't have hydrogen infrastructure for long haul trucking, which could be a very interesting direction. We don't have hydrogen for energy production on a large scale, which could be interesting for the development of liquid fuels, which could be interesting. For all of those things, hydrogen would be really interesting, as well as geothermal. I mean, you have a secretary of energy who was deeply, deeply involved in geothermal, was on the board of a geothermal company. He has, obviously, extensive experience with drilling, which is what you really need to do geothermal effectively. There's pieces of the future energy landscape that need major capital investment. And those things seem to be being supported by this administration. And I think that we should celebrate that. And hopefully, if that's coupled with a move to make it easier to build, easier to connect, and easier to transport electrons, then hopefully that helps us not take a step back over the next four years, but take a step forward. Are there any particular sectors that your firm is really going to pivot to or focus more on because of the change in administration? I think, really, what we're focused on is good investments. We evaluate every investment separately, and every investment has its own set of dynamics. There are certain things that might not make sense because incentives aren't there. Then there are certain things that will make more sense. But time will tell. We're not at a point where we're still investing. We're still moving forward. We're still building projects. And we've got no reason to stop at this point. A colleague of mine wrote a piece on generated intelligence at the end of the year, right after the election, that basically said, we look at, as a barometer, where capital is flowing and how capital is flowing. And a number of these major Wall Street players, big banks and others, have been continuing to invest in this space over the course of the last year through the turmoil of an election cycle. And they were not betting that one or the other party was going to win the election. They knew that it was close. They knew that it was going to be down to the wire, and yet they still continue to invest. And I think that that's as indicative as anything of the fact that, you know, the effort to transition the economy, it's moving fast, and there are wins behind it. There are wins in front of it, but there are wins behind it as well. Well, it's only day two so far of the new administration. We already have plenty to talk about, and we could probably go on for a whole lot longer, but we'll definitely have a lot of conversations like this over the next few more years. And I'll have to have you back on in a couple of years to see how a lot of this shook out. But Jonah, thank you so much for coming on to the pod. Andrew, thank you so much for having me.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter and deputy managing editor for InfoLogix North American News Coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest, someone who is going to give us a close look at the enterprise FiberCo industry, glimpses of financing plans for 25, AI, data centers and more. I have with me FiberLite CEO, Bill Major. Bill, how's it going today? It's going great. Thank you for having me, Matt. Good to see you. Likewise. Good having you on the show. I've been looking forward to this one for a bit. So Bill, I thought we'd start the conversation just getting state of the market, you know, a broad look at the enterprise FiberCo industry. It's something we at InfoLogix have been tracking closely. Seems like there's a mix of good and bad news in the industry. I'm not going to pick on any particular names, but for our subscribers who follow closely our newsfeed, they could probably use their imagination of who that may be. Give us a rundown of the industry, how you see it. Thanks, Matt. From my perspective, the industry's changed dramatically. There's been a bullish push for infrastructure funds, private equity to have a certain percentage of their investments in TMT in general. But the enterprise fiber market, and specifically regional providers, have had a great run for the past 10 years. It seems with not only the infra act passed by the federal government with the money coming in for mead and other sources, it seems like even though we're sitting on record dry powder it comes to private equity, there's been a softening when it comes to enterprise fiber. You know, you talked about leaving the names out of it, and I'll do my best to do so. But as you look across the landscape of the enterprise fiber, there's been investments with private equity firms that are now in their years 5, 6, 7. You've got aging sponsors. A lot of these companies have had to refinance, probably not during the best time to refinance with higher interest rates. You've got naturally the cost of building a mile of fiber being dramatically more expensive, shortages in splicing companies. And when you look at it, there's almost a state where I feel like the enterprise fiber industry as a greater whole has some challenges where there was a strong appetite to go out and do greenfield builds. There is a strong appetite to go out and do a bunch of fiber to the tower. That particular segment of the industry has softened. So it should be an interesting, and I've been talking about this now nearly 20 months since I've been here, that the next two to four years, we're going to be very exciting time. A company like, you know, FiberLite with a new sponsor, we're in a unique place. We need to be patient. And the industry's definitely showing signs of that. Recently, there was the announcement of Comcast acquiring Nitell. Of course, you're well aware of Verizon acquiring Frontier once again. Recently, EZ Fiber acquired the New Mexico assets from Kintera. So there's definitely signs that the enterprise fiber industry is changing. And those that are in that space with access to capital and equity are going to capitalize. Interesting. Yes. Thank you for that input. Yeah, certainly. Seems like interesting times ahead, given the dynamics that you're describing. Let's segue a little bit. You and I talked at the very beginning of 2024, back in, I think it was February, told me FiberLite could weigh project finance rates for certain projects above a certain dollar threshold. Can you give us an update on that? Tell us what we could also expect to see from FiberLite over the next 12 months, in addition to any financing plans you may have? Great question. With competing priorities for working capital, I'm always going to look at what's available from a financing standpoint. Project financing, of course, the Europe-based lending institutions are really around this. There's definitely been a slow adoption for US-based banks, but I think they're coming around. I've hosted a decent amount of meetings, more casual meetings and formal meetings. There is a huge interest in lending to companies like FiberLite. And with the large projects we have, I'm going to continue to look at project financing. There's no doubt about it. Again, it's about weighing out competing priorities. I'm going to look at what opportunities align with our vision, our growth strategy, and I'm going to be very selective. If my current financing vehicle can't support a large project that's extremely accretive to my vision and that expansion for either organic growth or M&A, then I'm going to look to project financing as needed. But I don't think with all the interest in AI and data centers and everything else, there's ever going to be enough available working capital. Gotcha. What can you tell me, what kind of projects are you guys working on that might be interesting to our listeners? I kind of touched on it, Matt, right? It's the AI bubble that is in its infancy. Right now, these are large language learning models, right? And the evolution of AI, we're not even scratching the surface. I understand Gemini and all these things, chat, GPT. Those are language learning models. What AI is capable of, we've yet to see. And this reminds me, I was talking recently to some bankers, and they asked what my thoughts were on AI. This, to me, is no different than the internet bubble that hit nearly 30 years ago, right? Nobody really knew what the demand was going to be, and it just grew from there. I think it's very similar. So to answer your question, we've got great interest due to our unique assets in some of what I'll call less populated areas throughout Texas, especially. There's no longer available space, water, and power in the Ashburn area. So we're seeing a shift of data center operators and builders moving through Prince William County and down what I'll call Southeast. And then we're seeing decent demand throughout Texas, right, where they can find that available space and power. And Texas seems like, even though there's great stress on the power grid, this has been a great state for people to start building data centers. Yeah, it seems like that's a little bit of a debate right now, right? Especially West Texas, is this going to be, you know, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, data center a heli? Maybe not that, but, or is it some false promise? As you see it, West Texas, that represents good opportunities for fiber optic investors, data center investors. Is that how you see, do you think you are bullish on West Texas in particular? No doubt about it. So over the past three months, we've had multiple seven figure, you know, deals that came in the door. And these are for edge applications and data centers, and it's West Texas. So there is a definite shift to finding where that space and power are available. I mean, it sounds like I'm talking about years ago, Matt, but you know, a year ago, everything was shifting South of Dallas. Now we're seeing this demand shifting far West Texas. So again, you would hope that your fiber is in the right place and you are a proven carrier like we are. So we're often getting tapped knowing that we have some very unique routes and the capabilities of diversity back here, primarily to 1950 stemming right here, here in Dallas. So I don't see the demand slowing down. Matter of fact, probably something we're going to talk about. So it might be a great segue before you even ask me that, you know, when you look at data centers in general, planned and under construction for the next three years already committed. Right. So how do hyperscalers and I'll say large software as a service companies find data centers to build out? Well, you know, interesting enough, there was an announcement in the last couple of days, how they partnered up with Meta. They're going to build a $12 billion data center in Louisiana. They're a Bitcoin miner. And I can assure you recently we were awarded a contract with a Bitcoin mining company here in Texas to build out a unique, diverse route from West Texas to Dallas. So the demand is there. It's just they're going to have to get more creative. And I think that might be, you know, it's a tangent, but Bitcoin mining companies have these facilities that they can actually fulfill some of that demand that isn't readily available for at least four years. Interesting. Yeah, certainly that's something we've been looking at. I've been looking at one of the projects and I think I mentioned this one to you in the past. IREN, formerly known as Iris Energy, has a project in West Texas. I think it was 1.4 gigawatts. They're looking to have it powered up a little over a year from now, if I'm recalling right. Very interesting. And they're running some kind of process right now with I believe Morgan Stanley on, OK, do we want to power up the property and flip it or are we going to execute on a data center development ourselves? It's that type of thing that, yeah, we've been looking at. When we talk to equity investors, they're a little bit reluctant. They recoil at the word Bitcoin or crypto. But yeah, it's interesting to lenders. Lending industry is not scared of that. And I guess they could structure their deals differently than an equity investor, obviously, where they are looking at those opportunities. So it is an interesting time, especially in that area. Speaking of West Texas or Texas in general, I'd say this is something you brought to my attention. I thought it'd be interesting to talk about for a minute here. But talk to me why we haven't seen Amazon in the Texas data center market yet. Amazon, as we all know, is a huge hyperscaler, Amazon Web Services. Why have we not seen them in the Texas market as of yet? Great question, Matt. There is a law here in Texas specific to biometrics. And they do not align with Amazon's philosophy or policy they have. I can't answer the finer question, but I know they have a challenge with the Texas biometric law. I think one of two things are going to happen. As you think through the hyperscalers, if it's a Microsoft shortly after, there's Meta in the same area, then Google, and then Amazon, right? They've avoided Texas. They can't avoid Texas forever. Again, when you look at space and power, I just referenced the HUD 8 and Meta announcement in Louisiana. When was the last time you heard about a $12 billion data center investment in Louisiana? We're running out of land. We're running out of available water and power. So at the end of the day, I do believe next year, 2025, we should hope to see, I don't like to use the word hope, but I do hope to see Amazon come to Texas. When we look at our 20,000 miles of fiber, we have high capacity, high strand count, unique routes. We could be a valuable partner to them as we have been in other states and markets. I do believe 25 and beyond, they're going to have to either change their policy or make some type of sacrifice, but they'll be coming to Texas, I believe. So interesting. Of all things we cover, this could potentially have a large impact on Texas when Amazon does form a presence in Texas, I would imagine. That absolutely. You know, once Amazon leans in, they lean in hard. And again, it's going to be, where are those requirements? Where's the land? Where's the water? Where's the power? And again, those are in some unique rural areas where we had demand over the last, you know, call it 10 years, and we built really robust and unique routes. So we should be a huge beneficiary of them coming to Texas, but it's going to be definitely a benefit to other telecom providers, other connectivity providers. They don't put all their eggs in one basket, right? Fiber light might not be the primary, but we're going to be a tertiary route as they build that second, third route back to the edge, I'll call it, right? They need to get back to Dallas. So it's going to be what I'll call a tailwind behind us in 25 and beyond. Interesting. Yeah, thanks for that. Now, let's see what happens, see how this plays out. Just bringing it back to the fiber side of things, why don't you give us your forecast of where M&A is going to head in 2025? I know there's not so much enterprise fiber, but, you know, we do write a lot about fiber of the home and things more retail, and we saw a number of those processes come to a halt and even 23, definitely 24. Some are expecting maybe those to relaunch at 25, but, you know, from your vantage point, where do you see things going, playing out in 25 on the M&A front? Sometimes you've got to look in the recent rearview mirror. Again, recently, Everstream sold off St. Louis to Cogs. I mentioned how EZ picked up New Mexico from Conterra. Frontiers Board just approved the acquisition or re-acquisition of Frontier assets to Verizon. T-Mobile recently acquired first Lumos, and then, of course, as a follow-on, Metronet. I really believe we're in a unique place when it comes to M&A. There were discussions. I was part of an article that came out about three months ago where I was bullish that M&A was going to continue throughout the end of the year, regardless of the November election. That's happened, and I don't think it's slowing down. In the last two weeks, I've heard about two new deals coming to market that I really didn't expect them to. And again, I think it comes down to a couple of things. The fiber-to-the-home space, so I can cover off on holistically, not just enterprise, right? As I talk to investment bankers and institutional lenders, there's a perception that it's fully all in at this point. There isn't a need to add that fifth and sixth and seventh alternative to the lacking cable MSO. And because so many of these fiber-to-the-home companies have quickly deployed in these accretive neighborhoods, I see a slowdown in that space, but I don't see a slowdown from an M&A standpoint. I see a slowdown in deployment in new fiber-to-the-home companies. I see more of that consolidation. I talked about the nationwide mobile operators acquiring fiber, right? Again, I've been quoted saying this. Mike Seifert, the CEO of T-Mobile, said he would never get in this space. Well, Lumos was the first. Metronet was the second. I don't think he stops there. Rumors have it Verizon, after the Frontier acquisition, has another one lined up. I think it's going to be as frothy of an M&A market that we've seen in several years. I mean, it was a very frothy M&A activity from, call it, 2013, 14, all the way through, call it 2020. And then, again, things, these larger regional providers, such as First Light or an Everstream or Unity, for that matter, or FiberLite, we have our geography, our territories. That has slowed down. But I think it's going to open back up. Because, again, if there is a challenge for availability to capital in general, it can either be equity from their sponsors or from some type of debt facility or project financing. If those companies don't have access to it, they're going to have to peel off a market or two and sell it. I heard word this morning, even a fiber-to-the-home company is looking to spin off a couple of markets. So I think it's going to be an interesting, once again, 18 to 24 months. And I'm going to be very selective in what we do. I am looking at two acquisitions right now. One's in process and one I'm looking to put an indicative offer into. But those are going to be what I call pure play enterprise fiber opportunities. I can't scale from a cog standpoint to get into fiber-to-the-home. I would have to reimagine our network operations center, staff up. That's not in the cards. I'll let those successful businesses continue and I'll enable them either through middle mile or first mile, but definitely not the last mile play. But again, this isn't just specific to telecom. Every morning, listening or watching Squawk Box while catching up on my work emails before I get to the office, they expect this to be a very interesting year from an M&A standpoint under the new administration and activist investors, et cetera. It's going to be a fast pace. Gotcha. I appreciate that. Yes, we're expecting the same, very fast paced M&A environment for 25. We're getting ready for it. It's something we're expecting. Everybody, I think what you're saying aligns with what everybody else is telling me, especially on the fiber front, going back to fiber-to-the-home, yet very much it was a land grab type of play for a number of years. And I guess it still is to some extent. But yeah, people are telling me there's going to be some consolidation there. Either to kind of fix it up or to compete more with regionals where that applies. So going to be interesting. Going to be an interesting 12, 24 months, like you said. I think that's all the time we have today. So Bill, I really appreciate you stopping by and just giving us some observations on the market and just what some of your guys' plans are. Let's keep in touch and maybe do this again in a year and see where things landed for you, for you and FiberLite. First of all, always great to catch up with you. I have a feeling we'll talk again soon with everything that's going on in this space. But I agree, the next couple of years are going to be a dynamic period to be in this space. And you're going to have plenty to report on in interviews. So look forward to catching up with you soon. Music to my ears. Definitely. I'm looking forward to it. All right, everybody. That was Bill Major from FiberLite. Thank you for listening to our podcast. Don't forget to like, subscribe and share. That's it for me this week. Don't forget to tune in next time. Until then, take care and have a happy new year.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Now, we have a very interesting guest today. Catherine Flax is the President of Private Markets at XMC Strategies, a private equity firm focused on, as they describe it, the energy transformation. Catherine, thank you for joining us today. My pleasure, Andrew. Delighted to be here. So, Catherine, we hear a lot about the energy transition. It's been a topic of a lot of our coverage and a lot of our podcasts this year. But XMC, I think, has a unique approach to the energy market that falls somewhere between conventional power and renewables. Now, where is your firm looking for investments? Thank you, Andrew. And we do approach things a bit differently. And it's not just power. It's across the entire spectrum of energy. And the distinction that we draw between transition and transformation is really around what we think is a pragmatic approach to the recognition that we really do need all forms of energy right now. And in particular, that while we, I think, collectively recognize that we want to move into a world where energy is clean, we can both be where we are today in the world of conventional energy and move to a future state. But we're the bridge where we've got one foot in conventional. We've got one foot in kind of the future states. But it's really all about how do we make the most out of what we have today? That's interesting because obviously, it's not going to be a flip that's switched. We're not going to overnight get rid of all our conventional power. And I think people are aware of that. But you see a lot of firms that are either investing in one or the other, either purely in renewables or just looking at conventional. Can you give some examples of investments or firms that you've worked with or backed that exemplify this approach? Absolutely. To get very granular. When we think about, let's say, an investment in an upstream oil and gas asset, we think about being the last owner of that asset, recognizing that all of these are depleting assets. And when we are the owner of, let's say, an oil field, the traditional private equity approach is to squeeze the costs out of it and then flip it seven years later. Our approach is to run the asset, again, whatever sort of energy asset it is, as well as we possibly can do. But then focus on the transformation of that asset into a future state so we're not leaving behind a landfill or polluted space. And so an excellent example of that is one of our portfolio companies, Gradient Geothermal, where Gradient is generating baseload clean energy, geothermal, but using the naturally occurring hot fluids in that oil field. And so we're taking a waste product, making a very cost efficient source of clean energy and creating something that is sustainable for the future. That's very interesting. And if our listeners are also subscribers to Infralogic and you want to read more both about XMC and this particular firm, on October 23rd, I published an article called Geothermal Firm Plans $25 Million Series A. So you can do a search for that, read a little bit more about that if you are an Infralogic subscriber. So that's one example of an investment. Now, do you only look at these types of transitional investment? Would you look at a pure power or conventional renewable asset, or is that really not in your wheelhouse? No, we definitely do. Usually though, it's in the context of a broader transformation. So I'll give you an example. There's a project that we have that is in our pipeline, which is, it's again, an upstream asset that has a number of different ways that it can be transformed. That is, again, in a geothermal installation, but it also has a lot of surface. So we are also planning a solar installation. That's sort of a conventional renewable source. As far as we're concerned, everything's on the table. So it really is down to the specific assets and what its best use is today, but also in the long run. How long have you been at XMC and how old is that platform? We started around 2021, so a little, three and a half years, let's say, and we have moved now into, you know, we closed our fund one, we're kicking off fund two. And so we've been really thrilled with the market response to what we think is very unique approach to the needs of the world as it relates to energy. What was your background before joining XMC? I have been in the world of commodities, mostly sales and trading for many decades. And so I worked at places like JP Morgan and BNP Paribas across the commodity spectrum. But my main focus has always been energy. But you have a broad view of the sector for many years. That's correct. And were you at the ground floor at XMC when it launched or did you join later on? I actually was at the ground floor. I started as an investor and an advisor and just really fell in love with the work and so wanted to make it my full-time work. And so I'm officially a co-founder. But the founder, a gentleman named Talal Debs, is a former colleague of mine from JP Morgan and is a great example, I think, of the unique team that we've assembled at XMC. Talal himself has a PhD in physics and brings, I think, a really interesting perspective from a finance but also engineering and technology approach. And across the team, we have people with interesting science backgrounds, engineering backgrounds, finance backgrounds. We have some architects and other interesting people that are in the mix. And I think that helps to craft different kinds of solutions. Well, it really is an interesting firm in that way. And you see it in terms of its investments, some really interesting companies. And XMC, why don't you tell listeners kind of what that stands for and what the meaning is there? Sure. So it's certainly a conversation starter that we found. XMC stands for X Machina Capital Strategies and X Machina really being sort of the mechanics or how things actually work. And really what we're trying to do is craft tangible, practical solutions to complex problems. And that idea, the broader phrase, and you'll see it on our website if you go there, is Logos X Machina. And it's really about making logic and sense out of complex realities. Very interesting. So, when we talk about the energy sector, I think it's clear to say it's very much changing. We're really in a time of transition and not just when it comes to moving from conventional energy, fossil fuels, to renewables. One of the major themes of Crossroads throughout 2024, if you've been listening since the beginning of the year, has been that increasingly you can't separate the energy sector from data centers, AI, and the growing need for power. That really dictates everything that energy firms, policy makers do in their approach to energy. Now, I'm sure a lot of these, a lot of my listeners, a lot of our readers have heard these statistics ad nauseum. But for example, electricity demand, which has really been pretty much flat for the last few decades, is now expected to grow by up to 50% over the next 10 years or so. And that's because of AI. That's because we are building bigger and more data centers. That's because, to some degree, there's increased manufacturing. So you have a unique view of the industry. I'm curious, do you think that the energy sector is ready to meet that kind of growing demand? So, if there's one thing that keeps me up at night, it's exactly that. I've been involved in energy, as I said, for over three decades now. The beautiful thing about energy is it's never been boring. That sort of confluence of geopolitics and technology and weather and all the things that make it complicated and interesting have only become way more acute in very recent days. And I think the world is waking up to the fact that, as you said, whether it's data centers, whether it's electric cars, whether it's the electrification of buildings, increased manufacturing, there's a whole bunch of reasons why we have a wall of demand that's coming at us that we've never seen before. And I think that, on the one hand, I have a lot of confidence in human survival instincts. And so I think people's interest in and desire to solve the problem is going to result in good answers. Having said that, the transition between now and when the solutions are finalized could be very rocky along the way. And energy is so fundamental to growth in economies, human well-being. It's part of why I've loved being in this industry all these years, because I do think that probably next to food, energy is the next most important thing for human beings to be able to flourish. And so I take it very seriously that we need to come up with solutions. And frankly, that's part of why, again, going back to gradient geothermal, I think we find we as a broader team find it very gratifying every day to wake up and say, how do we incrementally make this better? And so being able to do things like take a waste product and make baseload power that is economic, it's not going to solve the whole problem, but it's going to be part of it. But to answer your question more directly, no, we don't have the whole solution yet as a world and as a problem. And I think even though XMC is a relatively young firm, three and a half years old, launched after the pandemic, the industry in terms of how it's approaching this has radically shifted even within that time. I don't think people were talking about the way AI was going to radicalize the need for energy 18 months ago, let alone three and a half years ago. So how has your approach shifted in response? Well, so it's interesting, I think that, you know, we started talking about a lot of these topics long before they became mainstream. And so it does feel like our thesis has the world has sort of come our way, which is helpful. That sort of idea that all of the above is needed in terms of energy sources is important. I'll say it's interesting. That's not the right adjective. But I think it's becoming increasingly obvious that companies, states, countries, everyone who's had a net zero goal is probably going to miss it. And in part, it's because of this huge surge in demand. And so there's going to need to be, I think, an honest conversation about, well, what does this actually mean? And what are we going to do about it? But I think the other part of that conversation that's very important is affordability. I think we've already seen in capacity prices in PJM, for instance, have gone way up in power markets. And those sorts of like indicators that the pricing structure of energy is also likely to change is concerning. And that's where I do think that finding other ways, things that have nothing to do with exactly what I do every day, but like things like demand response are actually really important. Because those are ways that individuals can respond to price signals, and maybe respond in a way that would reduce some demand that could be really helpful. All solutions need to be put on the table right now. Yeah, that's an interesting point. I mean, you do sometimes hear about how power producers, how energy firms will be able to pass some of those costs on to companies and various stakeholders have different price sensitivities. Utilities are much more sensitive to that than data center operators who really could care less what they pay for power. What they pay for power, you know, as long as it's available to them. So that is a good question there. I mean, what do you think the biggest stumbling blocks are to being able to tackle this? I think the first thing is, we need to have an honest conversation about what is the issue. Because I do think that it's not broadly understood. I think in the population in general, things like, wow, your electricity bill may really, really go up. That's a problem. And I don't know that people are necessarily aware of that. So for people to get mobilized around a solution, I think partly is, they will know it when it happens. But maybe in advance of that, it would probably be good to kind of raise awareness. But then I think the other thing too, is some real practical things like, if repowering nuclear plants, which again, is not a business that I'm in this this moment, but I think it's interesting to see that there's a real resurgence of interest in nuclear, a lot of the regulatory hurdles that need to get, you know, addressed, those are the sorts of things that could make it easier to get some solutions that are meaningful on the table. And I think we're not quite oriented toward that right now. And that might have to change if we're going to actually make some headway. And then on the other side of this, obviously, we're talking, we're all power users, we're all people who pay for power. But you're also an investor, where does this create opportunities as an investor to make money while trying to solve this problem, or, or simply find investment opportunities? And that's really at the core of what we're doing at XMC. Because fundamentally, being a good steward is not inconsistent with getting good returns. I mean, you know, we're a private equity firm. So our job is to get good returns for our investors. We actually think that being good stewards will make more money, not just in spite of but because of the example of that is exactly what we call the exit problem on traditional oil and gas assets. If it's hard to get investors in traditional oil and gas assets today, one would think it's going to be all that much harder seven or 10 years from now. But if we've solved the exit problem by saying, no, it's it we're not leaving a just a polluted, useless mass of land, but rather, we're going to convert it into something that, you know, is actually a sustainable source of energy going forward. Not only is that a good thing to do, because it makes the world a better place, but it also is viable financially. And so that makes sense. So I think for investors to stop the binary thinking of it's either all conventional, or it's, you know, solar and wind are only clean energy solutions, just simply not the case. I think being able to kind of peel back the layers, and think about like, what are the fundamental challenges that have existed in energy investing, we've been pretty systematic about trying to identify what are those challenges, the exit problem is one. Another problem has been in oil and gas investing, historically, inadequate risk management. So getting the booms and the busts, that's not sensible, as far as we're concerned from an investor perspective. So I think there's things that investors can challenge themselves to think differently about where have there been issues, you know, renewables, for instance, have not returned a very, very good investment returns for the folks in that area. But that doesn't mean that there aren't sources of clean energy that are useful and viable. And again, I mean, you know, we're seeing that every day with our gradient business. So Catherine, in light of that, what are the investment classes of tomorrow, if we're having this conversation in two years? And looking back, what are some of the interesting investment classes or opportunities that people aren't really thinking of or aren't investable on a large scale today, that you think are going to be interesting? I can tell you, in addition to continuing the themes of our fund, one, the upstream asset transformation, we didn't even talk about the oil and gas well plugging business that we have and gradient, a couple of the other things that we're very focused on right now that are not yet ready for primetime in terms of giving you like company names and so on. But I'll tell you thematically, some of the things that we're really interested in are is clean transportation, we think that there's some interesting opportunities today in that. But the other thing that we're very focused on is data and transparency, particularly as it relates to carbon credits. And I think that right now, there's been softness in the carbon credit market for a whole variety of reasons. My personal view is that as a result of the missing of all of the net zero targets that many of the companies and countries have, there will be a renewed interest in high-quality carbon credits. And the best way of validating the quality of carbon credits is through strong data transparency and validation. And so I think what we're going to see is a real surge. And we see it already, a number of different technology companies are doing really good groundbreaking work in being able to ensure that when people are buying a carbon credit, it's not smoke and mirrors, that there's actual tangible things that are being done to clean things up in a way that is actually moving the needle and sustainable. So I think that there's still a work in progress, but I think that that's going to be some interesting areas to watch for. The company that we have in our portfolio, Zafiro Methane, is a company that focuses on the plugging of wells, oil and gas wells, and the generation of carbon credits and the work being done at Zafiro to invest in strong validation of the data and information so that the methane that's being abated can be tracked and create really, really high-quality carbon credits. It's that sort of work that's going to make a big difference going forward. Well, those are both really interesting companies. You mentioned, I know you said that there are some others that aren't, that you're not ready to talk about, but I'm sure for our Infralogic subscribers, you'll be reading about those in the months and year to come, so I'm excited for that. Great. So our last episode of Crossroads, we had Richard Glick on to talk about the former FERC chairman, to talk about really what would happen, what would change in the energy sector if Donald Trump was elected president. That was right before the election, and obviously, he is now the president-elect, set to take office in a month and change, in about a month and a week. How is that going to change the energy sector, and how is it going to change your approach now that we have a new administration with its own priorities? We have been very focused on building businesses that are resilient and are not dependent on who's in office. To do that, what we've tried to do is focus on being very pragmatic and on things that just are good common sense. We do a lot of work in red states, we do a lot of work in blue states, and we don't rely on federal funding or state funding. It doesn't mean that we haven't done work for, like at Zafiro, plugging wells for states that have orphaned wells and so on, we of course do that work, but none of our businesses are solely dependent on, or the profitability is reliant on, any of that. And that, for us, is just really important, because that's a good check for, is what we're doing really commercially viable and profitable in the long run? So that's fundamentally important. Having said that, it doesn't mean that there aren't changes, obviously, that we would anticipate coming along. But the one thing I would say about energy broadly is, and I mentioned this earlier, there are so many factors that are involved in what's happening globally in energy. Prices of oil may have to do with whether or not the regulatory environment shifts in the United States to allow for more drilling, but frankly, that's not the biggest factor. The biggest factor is, what's the supply and demand profile around the world that then drives the global energy price? So at the end of the day, I don't see anything that's sweepingly different with the new administration coming in. When you look at, for instance, companies or states' net zero goals, those didn't come from any federal administration. Those are commitments that companies made because they felt like that was the right thing to do. So I don't see those things changing very much at all. Now, where I anticipate we might see some changes, I mentioned earlier that we might want to have some regulatory changes to make it easier, for instance, for nuclear repowering and things like that. Again, not directly impacting my business today, but I would imagine that the new administration may try to streamline some of the regulatory hurdles to make that easier. But that might have happened irrespective of who was in office, because recognizing that we have such a need for more energy, that would just be a practical thing to do. So maybe I'm optimistic, but I do think that common sense and pragmatism is generally going to be the order of the day. And as a country, we recognize that national security is inextricably linked to energy success in this country. And so I think good decisions are going to get made. It's never a dull time for the energy sector, but certainly not right now. Well, Catherine, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

The past five years have been a roller coaster for the nascent US offshore wind sector, punctuated by record-setting federal auctions that saw project sponsors commit billions of dollars for the rights to develop projects off America's shores, a subsequent wave of contract cancellations as the sector strained under the weight of post-COVID macroeconomic stress, the first deliveries this year of electricity to the American energy grid from utility-scale offshore wind farms, and there have been plenty of other leaps forward and nasty stumbles along the way. But for the majority of that period, the sector has had the benefit of a supportive federal government and a bureaucracy aligned toward ambitious offshore wind development goals set by President Joe Biden. All of that is set to change in January with the election of former President Donald Trump, who has long been vocal about his opposition to offshore wind energy. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to end offshore wind development on day one of his second administration, although the details of what that would look like have not been particularly clear. I'm Chuck Stanley, senior policy reporter for InfraLogic, and today I'll be speaking with Marcia Hook, an energy regulatory and markets partner with Clifford Chance's Washington, D.C. office. Marcia has substantial experience in the US offshore wind sector, having worked directly on the financing for major projects off the East Coast. We'll be talking about the current state of the industry and what a second Trump administration might mean for the future of America's offshore wind fleet. We'll also be talking about the recent auction for areas in the Gulf of Maine, in which Invenergy and Avangrid secured rights to develop floating offshore wind projects off the Massachusetts coast. Marcia, thanks so much for joining the podcast today. Thank you for having me. Well, just to jump right into it, for listeners who aren't familiar with your work in the US offshore wind sector, can you share a little bit about your experience in the sometimes melodrama of bringing this industry forward in the States? Certainly. I've been fortunate to get the opportunity to advise a number of clients in connection with offshore wind projects in the US. That experience includes acting as special federal energy regulatory counsel in connection with the tax equity financing of a major US offshore wind project, advising an investor in connection with its investment in the US developer of offshore and onshore renewable projects, and advising on the energy regulatory aspects of a proposed financing of an in-development offshore wind project. So you've been deeply immersed in this sector as it's come forward and developed. I touched a little bit on the various ups and downs of offshore wind in the US over the recent years. I wonder if you could share your sense of where the industry stands today and where investor confidence in the US offshore wind sector stood going into the election in November. Certainly. I would say that prior to the election, there was substantial enthusiasm in the US offshore wind space. As I've said previously, I think that the US offshore wind market has reached a certain level of maturity that has really started to attract investors, not just in the US, but also abroad. And so we were seeing a lot of movement into the space, including investors that are developing offshore wind projects abroad, and we're seeing the US market as a real opportunity to develop projects. And as listeners are no doubt aware, Donald Trump won the election this month and he'll return to office in January. He's been very clear about his feelings toward offshore wind. You just spoke about stakeholders who are maybe invested in offshore wind outside the United States and were interested in investing in the US sector. What does the election of Donald Trump mean? What are stakeholders expecting from the new administration? And what does this mean for the continued development in the US offshore wind sector? So to give a high level answer, Trump's victory has undoubtedly introduced significant uncertainty into the US offshore wind sector. At the same time, there's an understanding that there will be limits on what any president can do, which will constrain the impacts to offshore wind. And there's a cautious optimism that the new administration may see the benefits to the US workforce and manufacturing industries that can result from the further buildout of offshore wind. So drilling down a little bit further onto the first half of that question, as you alluded to earlier, it's no secret that throughout his campaign, Trump expressed strong opposition to offshore wind projects, pledging to terminate them immediately upon taking office. I think he said something along the lines of, we are going to make sure that that ends on day one. So it's a bit of a challenging narrative to come up against. As you can imagine, industry stakeholder reaction has been a bit divided on this point. Some industry stakeholders have voiced concerns about the future of offshore wind in the US. You see major players in renewable energy, warning of potential delays and increased risk for offshore wind projects under the incoming administration. But at the same time, some industry leaders are cautiously optimistic. They emphasize the economic benefits and job creation associated with offshore wind projects. And they're hoping that these factors will encourage continued support and development even under a new administration. And of course, there's a significant question of what the Trump administration realistically can do to impact offshore wind projects, especially those that have already received their federal permits. And so it sounds like the expectations or how those feelings by Donald Trump towards the offshore wind sector might manifest in actual regulatory and policy decisions seems a bit up for determination and kind of guesswork right now. I think that's a fair assessment. It's always challenging to know how campaign promises and rhetoric will manifest into political reality under any administration. But this administration perhaps poses an even greater challenge than others. Right. And you mentioned questions about sort of a difference between projects that are further along through the permitting process. During the first Trump administration, there were a lot of complaints about permitting delays for offshore wind. As we look towards 2025, you know, there are now a number of projects that are either very deep into the permitting process or they've received the green light from federal regulatory agencies for construction. How vulnerable are those later stage projects or even the ones that have begun generating electricity to a less favorable regulatory environment? You really hit the nail on the head when you ask about the different development stage of a project when you think about the vulnerability of the project, because how vulnerable a project is really depends on where the project is in the permitting and development process. So, for example, you alluded to projects that are already in operation. Those projects are the least vulnerable. Once the project's already generating electricity, there are a lot less avenues for regulators to slow down the process of developing and operating the project. That being said, technically not even operational projects are completely safe. There could be things like added regulatory hoops to jump through in terms of continued operation and even potentially changes to incentives that change the commercial value of the project. The second group of projects, which I think of as medium vulnerable projects, if you will, are the projects that have all their federal approvals and are getting ready to break ground, but they haven't yet broken ground. So those projects have crossed the finish line in terms of major federal permitting, so they won't necessarily see the permitting delays we heard about during the first Trump administration. But again, indirect changes could trip them up, right? If the administration cuts tax incentives or changes regulations governing BOEM permittees, it could throw a wrench in the development of those projects. Then there are the projects that are still waiting in the permitting process. Those are the ones that are the most vulnerable. If the new administration decides to slow block approvals, like we saw during the first Trump administration, that could really challenge the development of those projects. The uncertainty makes it harder for developers to get financing and line up suppliers, and that can really challenge the continued viability of a project. And so I guess that stands to reason, the projects that have made the least progress through the permitting process are the most vulnerable to an administration that's not as invested in trying to make sure that these projects get speedy approval and begin construction. And so moving on, in addition to the recent election, just before the November 5th election, the Interior Department held its most recent offshore wind auction for areas off the East Coast that would host floating offshore wind facilities. Just half of the areas put up for auction were claimed in that process. And Interiors confirmed that Invenergy and Avangrid, the two winning bidders, were the only participants in the auction. How should we interpret those results, both in terms of development in the areas that were up for auction and for investor sentiment in the U.S. offshore wind sector more broadly? I think it's a little bit difficult to know for sure what broader signals it sends about investors' confidence in the U.S. offshore wind industry. But certainly it's notable that that auction closed only days before the election. And certainly there was a bit of wait-and-see sentiment in the run-up to the election by investors and developers in the offshore wind space. So while it's difficult to know for sure what all the drivers were that led to only half of the areas being contracted, it does seem to be an indicator that there was some trepidation with respect to the outcome of the election. So probably some apprehension over uncertainty over the political climate. But I guess it seems like there could have been other factors as well, either with regard to concern over the broader U.S. offshore wind sector or the fact that these areas are suitable for floating offshore wind generation, which is a newer technology and less proven, especially in the U.S. Is that right? That's right. There are so many factors that undoubtedly went into various parties' decision not to bid on those areas. And as you correctly note, because it was the first commercial sale for floating offshore wind on the Atlantic coast, and offshore wind is such a new technology, it's possible that was part of the driver as well as concern about the outcome of the election and the general direction of the offshore wind industry in the aftermath of the election. And again, with floating, this is a less established technology. These areas have just been awarded the conditional leases. I wonder what, if any, progress would you expect to see toward developing these areas under the Trump administration, given everything we just said about the possibility of permitting difficulty? Could we see a complete freeze of activity on those areas? Might the developers hope to wait out for a more favorable regulatory environment? Or are there things that could be moved forward, even if they're not getting sort of the current level of support from the federal government that offshore wind has been seeing? I think it's unlikely that we'll see a complete freeze in the development of these projects. As you know, when the leases have already been signed, there's been commitments made by these developers. And at the end of the day, these projects are long term projects. Any offshore wind project in the United States takes a significant amount of time to develop. And so even if the developers get started today, in the best case scenario, this is a year's long process. And it could be that this is just a temporary, again, even assuming the worst case scenario that President-elect Trump takes a very adverse position to offshore wind, it's still just a temporary period in a very long development timeframe. So even though it's possible that we could see a slowdown, I think it's unlikely that we'll see a complete freeze in activity. And so as those projects move forward to the extent that they can and to the extent that they can under whatever the regulatory situation is under Trump, one thing that we've heard at InfraLogic a lot covering this space is about the specialized infrastructure and supply chains that are needed to support the build out of a floating offshore wind sector. So to the extent that the current political environment slows development of floating offshore wind off the East Coast, should we expect to see a cascading effect in which sort of delays to developments of these first floating projects lead to a slower development of the supply chain and infrastructures and maybe sort of a lagging behind of the entire development of the technology in the States? Absolutely. That's a really important point. And it is one of the biggest challenges facing the floating offshore wind sector in the United States. As you probably know, floating offshore wind facilities generally need a different level of specialized infrastructure, things like deep water ports and heavy lift vessels and manufacturing facilities. And looking globally, we've seen the cancellation of some floating wind projects due to supply chain issues. And so it's a supply chain and infrastructure that just doesn't exist fully in the United States and even globally. And that supply chain, that infrastructure will only grow if there's consistent demand to justify the investment. So if we see the federal government put the brakes on offshore wind, whether through permitting delays, cutting incentives or other unfriendly policies, then that demand signal starts to decline, and companies are less likely to scale up their operations to meet that demand. The challenge there is that the result can mean that even if the political winds were to shift again in a few years down the road, for example, if there's a new administration that's more pro-wind, those supply chain and infrastructure gaps will still be there. And that can slow everything down even more. It's not as if developers will be picking up where they left off, they'll be trying to essentially reboot a stalled ecosystem. So it's certainly possible that a slowdown now could have a cascading effect. It's not necessarily just about delayed projects. It's about a whole network of industries and infrastructure that will need to catch up. And the longer the delay, the harder it could be to get that momentum back up when or if the political environment swings back in the favor of offshore wind. And you mentioned that projects that are either, you know, completely through the permitting process or most of the way, they face less risk from, you know, a less friendly regulatory environment. We've heard that there's a number of late stage offshore projects in the U.S. that are looking for equity partners. I think the sponsors have been quite open about expecting to bring on new investors. Does the greater political certainty of having the election behind us make it easier for potential buyers to put a valuation on these projects? And do you think it's likely we could see some deal announcements in the coming weeks or months following the election? My sense is that we're still in a bit of wait and see moment. As discussed previously, it's difficult right now to predict how much of Trump's anti offshore wind rhetoric will translate into tangible impacts on the offshore wind sector. Even though we have greater certainty about who the next president will be, that certainty isn't translating into greater certainty for the U.S. offshore wind industry or valuation of individual projects. So even with a little bit more certainty over like what the overall posture of the executive branch is going to be towards offshore wind, potential investors are going to want to know really what the specifics of the policy environment going forward are going to be before they make long term decisions in all likelihood. I pointed to two different factors. One is just going back to that cautious optimism. While there certainly was some very anti offshore wind rhetoric on the campaign trail, at the end of the day, there is a significant opportunity for the Trump administration to come in and be pro energy, a pro energy administration. And if you look at who is investing in these offshore wind projects, both in the United States and around the world, the companies that are investing in this space include names that some might traditionally think of as oil and gas companies, because those companies are now broadening their horizons and becoming energy companies. And if you look at the number of jobs that these projects create, over 1000 per project, the knock on benefits to the U.S. supply chain and industry, there is some possibility that folks in the Trump administration will recognize that offshore wind projects, just like any other large energy project, represent a huge opportunity for the U.S. economy and workforce. Again, there is the possibility that this rhetoric, however negative it may be, won't manifest into actually negative policies by the administration. But even if the Trump campaign or the Trump administration does follow through on the campaign promises and tries to take adverse action against the offshore wind industry, there's still a question of what that adverse action is. Is it simply slowing down projects that are in the permitting process? Or is it finding a way to eliminate some of the tax incentives and other federal incentives that have been utilized to commercialize these offshore wind projects? So again, even though we have greater certainty on who the next president will be, we don't have certainty that that president actually will adopt anti-offshore wind policies or take anti-offshore wind actions. And if he does, what those actions might look like. Right. And I'm sure a lot of the major project sponsors will be trying to push that message of the benefits of driving a broader energy economy going forward. Now, unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. Marcia, are there any other final thoughts you'd like to share with regard to where the offshore wind sector stands in the U.S. as we speak or where it looks like going forward? I'd say that this is an industry that has a long time horizon and investors in this space, certain investors will be willing to continue to invest in the U.S. offshore wind space, even if there is a challenging political environment in the near term.

Good day. Our guest for today is Mr. Juan Carlos Valdivieso. He is a lawyer from Chile and from the firm Morales Ambeza. He focuses his practice on matters related to the energy industry, both in its transactional and regulatory aspects, with experience in project development, financing, M&A, and corporate matters. He joined Morales Ambeza in 2020. Previously, he served as general counsel from Prime Energía and in other firms in Chile and the U.S. Juan Carlos also teaches commercial law at the Universidad Católica School of Law since 2016. Welcome, Juan Carlos, to Crossroads. How are you doing today? Thank you, Eva, for that introduction and for those kind words and for having me in the podcast. I'm very well. How are you? Fine, fine. The topic that we're going to be discussing today is regarding the lack of or the few transmission projects in Chile, which is a big problem. So, Juan Carlos, my first question to you is why are there very few transmission line projects in Chile? Transmission has become a big problem for the energy transition here in Chile. It's not necessarily that there are few projects or, I should say, there is no lack of interest. That's not the issue. Actually, there is a consensus that we need more transmission and, as such, there are a lot of new works being projected. But the main difficulty, I would say, which is not exclusive to Chile, for sure, is that transmission development usually takes longer than developing generation facilities and that creates a decoupling between the two segments. And that slow pace in transmission development has been increasing. Permitting, among other causes for that, permitting continues to be a source of headaches for this and other industries. That was my next question. What roadblocks do these projects face and specifically for investors? So, I would say there are two main ones that come to mind. The first, as I mentioned, is permitting, right? Developing infrastructure projects in Chile is taking increasingly more and more time. Getting the permits is very difficult. It takes a lot of time and the certainty behind the permitting process has been put into question by several industries and several people. That's one thing. And specifically on transmission, there's also some issues with the regulatory structure of how these new projects are proposed, tendered, and then built and operated. What do you mean when you say there are certain problems in the regulatory process? You mentioned problems with the tenders and other aspects of the regulatory process. Could you be more specific? Sure. And let me walk you through how this process works in Chile. This process is fairly new, right? So, we in Chile passed a new law back in 2016. It's actually called the new transmission law, which overhauled the entire regulation of transmission, including the process for its expansion. One of the main drivers behind this new regulation was to ensure open access to the transmission system, avoiding discrimination to projects, and aiming at diversifying the grid also. This happened at the same time in which renewal started, increasing its participation in the Chilean grid. So, one of the main characteristics of our regulation or our regulatory framework as it stands today is that the expansion of the transmission system, meaning with expansion I mean what new projects get built, where and with which characteristics, is led and pushed mainly by public agencies with, I would say, a limited participation or initiative by private stakeholders. And what are the steps here for people working within the industry and in particular in the transmission segment? This is probably going to be a gross oversimplification, but basically there are three main regulatory bodies involved in the process. You have the Ministry of Energy, the National Energy Commission or CNE, and the Electrical Coordinator, which is our local ISO or system operator. These three bodies participate in a process that usually takes over a year or several years if you count the entire process to determine which new transmission projects need to be built, both new projects, new substations or transmission lines, and also expansion of existing facilities. For example, to increase their capacity to add a second circuit in an existing line, etc. or a new bay in an existing substation. So, along that process, which is, as I mentioned, mainly pushed by the governmental agencies, the industry can provide comments at different stages and eventually they can file claims before the panel of experts, which is a body that acts as a code of law, specifically within the energy industry matters. You can file claims before the panel of experts in case your observations throughout this process were, in your opinion, not appropriately settled or assessed. Whether because you proposed a new transmission facility that the agencies did not consider or the other way around, because there's something considered in the expansion plans that you want stricken down. Actually, that's the case when you usually see consumer associations or big consumers such as mining companies, for example, trying to strike down some of these initiatives. Since, by legal design, the consumers are the ones paying for transmission, they will pay for any additional line, they want the system to be very efficient where only the facilities that are strictly necessary get built. So, you end up having this back and forward and push from different sides on whether new transmission facilities are included in this expansion list of expansion projects or are excluded or included. So, after this whole process is ending, hence you have a final list of projects that is included in a decree published by the ministry and with that decree, the national coordinator starts an international tender process to award the construction and finally the exploitation of these new transmission projects to any interested bidder. This international tender process in many cases have proven successful but we've seen other processes in which there's no sufficient interest and either you see very few bids or not sufficient bids and the process ends up being deemed deserted. But let's assume for a second this is a successful tender process, if you win, you make a bid, you win, then you are awarded the right to build and operate a new transmission facility. What's important here is that you are grandfathered into a remuneration regime where you have access to a fixed tariff dependent on your bid for 20 years which makes it very interesting and allows the bidders to later finance the construction of these projects. This looks to me like a very long process. It is. How long does it take from the time this gets in the very pre-feasibility phase to the completion? It looks like it takes years then. It varies from case to case, projects are much more complex than others but for sure, I mean if you count from really the beginning of the process in which the expansion projects are proposed initially by the coordinator of the CNE, the International Energy Commission, until they are actually built and operational, it takes several years. But let me give you an even more critical example. We have a region here in Chile called the Ñuble region to the south of Santiago. This is actually suffering a lot the lack of transmission. Several other industries are waiting for new transmission lines and several of the processes of the tender processes for new transmission lines and facilities have been deserted. So they have been tendered more than once without anyone bidding or without anyone being awarded the project. For over five years, projects that should have been built by now, they haven't even been awarded yet. There are very critical situations like that. Let me just ask you about article 102 which has been mentioned there in Chile. Article 102 is called 102 because it's actually an exceptional mechanism embedded in article 102 of general electricity law in Chile. It's a mechanism to approve new transmission projects but avoiding this whole process that we just described. In very few words, companies may propose these urgent transmission facilities or the urgent need for a specific transmission facility to be developed and built. And this proposal is actually a request that undergoes a two-step approval process before first the National Electrical Coordinator and then the Energy Commission. If you get the approval by these two regulatory bodies in which you have to justify first its urgency and second its necessity, meaning why you think this particular project cannot wait for the whole tender process. If you get these two approvals, then you are allowed to build this quote-unquote urgent transmission facility. And so why is article 102 rarely used? That's a very good question. I personally have a philosophical issue with how this mechanism is structured. I actually had the chance of speaking about article 102 a couple weeks ago at the National Conference of Energy Law in Chile, which took place in Pucarenas. One of the things I mentioned there is that how this mechanism is structured confuses urgency with exceptionality and puts too much focus on the latter. What I mean here is things can be urgent depending on the circumstances. And of course, these circumstances have to be well regulated and as to avoid misuse of the mechanism. So the law and the regulations need to set which are the circumstances under which a transmission project can be legally deemed urgent. But in certain scenarios, an urgent thing may not be too exceptional, which is what we're seeing nowadays in Chile. We have several places in Chile where developing new transmission projects urgently. So if there are several, it necessarily means that at least for today, it's not too exceptional. So when you confuse urgency with exceptionality, you end up putting too much hurdles to actually use this article 102. But again, that's my take and it's more a philosophical issue of how the mechanism is structured. But we could waste time discussing philosophical and procedural concerns. But in reality, there's one specific or main reason why article 102 is not used, and that is an economic incentive one. I mentioned before that when you undergo this whole process of several years, when you end up being awarded a transmission project that was included in an expansion plan that followed the whole process, you have this grandfathered right for a fixed tariff for 20 years. That's not the case with urgent works under article 102. You do not have the benefit of a 20-year secure tariff remuneration, so there's a lack of incentive for transmission companies. Imagine for a second trying to push for an urgent transmission facility. You get both approvals and then you try to close a project finance for a transmission facility, but you tell the bank, hey, in four years or less, depending where exactly you got the approval, the CNE may end up changing my tariff or my remuneration regime for this particular facility. There's no finance structure that can accept it. There is a very important project in Chile right now. It's called the Quimalo Aguirre project. It is facing, obviously, potential delays. Could you talk a little bit more about that, about the potential delays the project is facing as a result of all this situation with delays in transmission lines? Absolutely, and Quimalo Aguirre is indeed a very important project. It's the biggest or the largest transmission facility currently under development, but I think some context is needed first. Due to its geography and the way resources are spread throughout Chile, we have a lot of renewable generation up north, mainly solar in the desert of Atacama, but this generation is far away from demand. Big cities in Santiago and down south and generally from consumption centers. This has created a very pressing need to have more transmission capacity connecting those two sites. That's where the Quimalo Aguirre project comes into play. The Quimalo Aguirre is a new transmission line over a thousand kilometers long. The first one of its kind in Chile because it's the first high voltage direct current line of this magnitude that is going to be built in Chile. Its main purpose is basically connecting or strengthening the capacity that we currently have connecting the north and the center-south part of the country. That's why it's so important. But again, for the many reasons I've already mentioned, for example, permitting. You have already started seeing in press releases for the last few months how the project is beginning to stumble across a couple of the permitting hurdles. The project is probably not going to be, I mean definitely not going to be operational by the initial date considered when the tender was launched 2028, but in my opinion probably at least a couple of years after that. But to be honest, the issue of transmission and the problems we have in Chile associated with it go far beyond one specific project. Let's talk a little bit about, since we have discussed all of these problems with transmission projects, what initiatives is the government proposing to move transmission projects forward? Are they doing something right now? They are. The government is doing things at a slower pace than we in the industry would like, but I mean there are several reasons for that. Not all of them entirely under the control of the government. But I'd like to mention two things here. First, we've mentioned the problems with permitting several times now, right? One piece of good news here is that there seems to be a general consensus now, along I would say most of the political spectrum, with nuances of course, but that a consensus that our environmental assessment system and general permitting framework needs some tweaking, and probably more than just some tweaking, right? The government a few months ago, it was actually several months ago, presented a bill of law proposing changes to these environmental assessment and permitting framework. Of course, the specifics of how this should be done are difficult to agree, and immediately after the government presented this bill of law, we saw people in the industry saying it wasn't enough, or it wasn't focused on what's important, but I think the fact that we are now discussing this, it's already good news in and of itself. One key issue in my opinion here is that we as a country, as an industry, shouldn't be focusing only or entirely on the timing it gets to obtain permits, which is indeed unnecessarily long in many cases, most cases I would say, but timing is not all. Efforts should also be put in in reducing the spaces of political discretion in many of these permitting processes concerning decisions that should be mostly technical, if we're being honest, and also making the whole permitting process more efficient, not only, again, concerning its timings, but also trying to avoid duplication. Nowadays, I've worked with financial institutions, I've worked with companies developing projects, and I've worked with big funds trying to purchase these projects, and you often see the same issues within the development of projects are assessed at different times in the process by separate agencies with different criterias on focus, and that's definitely not efficient, so hopefully this bill of law continues to be improved, and hopefully it will tackle the appropriate issues. There's still some times and a lot of ways down the road until this becomes an actual law of the country. That's one thing, right? And on the other side, and more specific to our industry, the Ministry of Energy has been pushing for some time now a bill of law called, quote-unquote, that's not exactly the name, but it's the Energy Transition and Habilitation of Transmission Law, right? This was presented for the first time last year, in 2023. It contains, among other things, such as incentives for the deployment of energy storage, but it contains several provisions specifically aimed at streamlining the transmission expansion process and tackling most of the issues that we've discussed today. I think there are several good ideas in this bill of law, such as, just as one example, forcing the system operator to analyze in advance the feasibility of actually constructing the planned expansion projects, and not just leaving that for as a concern of the company developing later in the game. Again, that's one example. There are other good things in that bill of law, but in my opinion, the one thing that it still lacks is to give more room to the participation of the private sector in pushing for new projects. We mentioned Article 102 minutes ago, right? Well, this bill now creates a new mechanism. Let's call it Article 91bis, because that's the number of the article it is embedded in, which is basically a new separate window. It's like a new Article 102. It doesn't eliminate the existing one, but it creates a new separate window for the approval and development of urgent facilities, outside of the whole years-long tender process. So, although it solves one of the main grievances that we have, the industry has, with Article 102, because it does grant these projects with a fixed 20-year term, it continues to be a very complex process with several steps and depending completely on the initiative of the government and public agencies. No room for private initiative, or very little room. Okay, let's be fair. It can be actually funny in some ways, because if you read through the process of how this Article 91bis is proposed in the bill of law, the way the bill is drafted, as of today, it can still change. It says in one part, and I'm paraphrasing here for the sake of time, that once the public agencies decide that a transmission project is urgently needed, they shall prepare a tender process to award its development and construction and being as efficient as possible and doing this process as little time as possible. When I find it that funny, does that mean that currently we are being purposely slow and inefficient? I know it's a caricature, right? But shouldn't all processes be as efficient and use as little time as possible? It shouldn't only be for, quote-unquote, urgent projects, right? So that's my view on this transmission project, but it's still pointed in the right direction for sure. We actually got some good news in these past couple weeks. This specific bill was just approved, I think, maybe not last week, but the week before that, was approved by the Mining and Energy Committee at the House of Representatives. So now it continues its constitutional process to become a law. There are still a few steps pending, but apparently the government is optimistic that it will be passed this year, for year end. Hopefully there's still some way for additional improvements, but again, it's a step in the right direction. Well, let's hope that we get a good bill and we can move these projects forward. That's all the questions that we have. I would like to thank you, Mr. Juan Carlos Alivieso, lawyer with Morales Ambeza in Chile, for participating in Crossroads. Thank you, Eva and Crossroads. I was very happy to be here. Hopefully this was all interesting to your listeners. And we hope to see you and all of our audience again. Again, thank you very much for coming to Crossroads.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Today we have a great and a very timely guest. Richard Glick is the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, better known as FERC. Rich was on the commission from 2017 to 2023 and was the chair of FERC from 2021 to 2023. Rich, thank you for coming on the show. Thanks for having me. So Rich, I gave a very brief introduction, but can you tell our listeners a little bit about your career background and your work with FERC? As you mentioned, I was the chair of FERC at the beginning of the Biden administration until I left the commission at the expiration of my term, which was in early 2023. Before that, I was a commissioner from 2017 to 2021, and we addressed a number of issues at FERC. I was there all the way from distributed energy resources to transmission to a number of capacity market issues in the Eastern United States and, of course, reliability. But I have a pretty lengthy set of jobs I've had, I guess I'm pretty old, in the energy industry. In particular, I've worked for a clean energy developer for a number of years, worked for an electric utility out west for a number of years, but also had a number of different jobs in government, including Capitol Hill and the Department of Energy and the Clinton administration. And I worked for Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson at the time. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, I worked on Capitol Hill on two different occasions. So I spent a lot of my life thinking about energy policy issues, especially at the federal level. So quite a long list of various titles you've held over the years. You have a long view of this industry, I'd say. Well, as I said, I'm old. That's why I have a long view. I've had a number of interesting jobs, and I don't think any time has been more exciting on energy issues than today, given everything that's going on. So we're recording this podcast on Monday, October 28th. It's eight days before Election Day. Right now, I think the betting markets are favoring Trump, but the polls really show it to be a coin flip election. Nobody has any idea who's going to win, so there's a real chance we could see a second Trump presidency. Now, you've been involved, as we said, in energy policy your whole career. You've seen various administrations, both Democrat and Republican. You've worked on the Democratic side. How would a Republican administration change the energy sector overall? Well, first of all, I would love to know who's going to win the election. But as you point out, we don't know today, and we may not know even on election night. So we'll have to see what happens. But if Trump were to win, certainly I think the change, I don't know if it would be in the energy sector, but certainly energy policy could change pretty dramatically. I think, first of all, we know that former President Trump has been a strong critic of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power. Even in the campaign, even as a matter of a couple days ago, he was still railing against both solar energy and wind energy. Certainly there would be a change at the very least in the tenor. But I think we'd also see a change in policies as well. Policies from the perspective of the current Biden administration, policies promoting clean energy transition. I think we'd see certainly less of a focus on government programs promoting those technologies or also limiting the barriers to those technologies. But also we'd see, I think, more of a bent towards traditional energy fuels and technologies, certainly oil and gas, coal and nuclear power. I think we'd see policies really aimed at focusing on increasing those technologies or certainly increasing aid to those technologies at the federal level. Now obviously it's not only the result of the presidential election that's uncertain. House and Senate are both, especially perhaps the House, are both really up in the air. So let's say, theoretically, Trump is to win the presidency but not control both houses and not be able to pass significant legislation. How can he affect some of the issues you're talking about just from the executive branch? I think you rightly point out that the impact on the energy industry is not just the result of the presidential election, but also the election of members of Congress, both the House and Senate, control the majority of those bodies can make a big impact. For instance, if President Trump were to win and the Republicans were to control the majorities in the House and the Senate, they might try to move legislation more focused, again, on the traditional technologies that we discussed a couple of minutes ago or legislation aimed at reducing the government incentives for clean energy, for instance. But even then, as you point out, the margins in both the House and Senate, regardless of who wins majorities, are expected to be close. And certainly it makes it more difficult with close margins to pass significant amounts of legislation, although that has happened in the past. You recall the Inflation Reduction Act was passed without any Republican votes. And in the Senate, there were only 50 Democrats. And the tie was broken by Vice President Harris at the time. But even putting aside Congress, let's say that under your hypothetical, and I'm certainly not hoping this isn't the case, but under the hypothetical, if former President Trump were to win this time around, and even if he wasn't able to achieve much of his agenda through congressional action, being the president controlling the executive branch really means the ability to influence a lot, regardless of legislative outcomes. So for instance, appointing cabinet secretaries, moving policies along. And I can name a couple that I think right off the top of my head could be a big impact if you're in the clean energy industry, one of which is offshore wind. As we know, former President Trump has attacked offshore wind on a number of occasions. And the government, particularly the Interior Department through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, has a big say in terms of leases that are provided for with regard to new offshore wind projects. Certainly, once offshore wind auctions are complete, there still is a lot of government work those projects have to go through, including getting permitting approval and getting a number of other approvals to the government process. And a new president with a Secretary of Interior that might be inclined to equally oppose offshore wind could have a dramatic impact on those programs. In addition to that, the Department of Energy has a number of programs which they're implementing under the Inflation Reduction Act. They're trying to get as much money out the door as they can before the end of the year, just in case the election changes things. But certainly, the next administration will still have a big role to play in loan guarantee program, for instance, or certainly funding for certain transmission programs. And I would expect under a Trump administration versus a Harris administration, you'd see much less money going out the door for those types of programs. Yeah. In my conversations with the sector, people are relatively not in a panic as much about solar, onshore wind, even battery storage. But they'll concede that if Trump does win, that offshore wind can be in trouble. Offshore wind and electric vehicles are the two sectors that I'm hearing a lot about would suffer the most under a Trump presidency. And I don't know enough about the electric vehicle sector to really comment intelligently about that. But obviously, I spent more of my time on utility-scale generation, for instance, which include offshore wind. I would point out that everyone asks this question pretty much every day, is that if Trump wins, what's going to happen to the Inflation Reduction Act, in particular, the solar and wind and storage tax credits that were included in that statute? And there's a lot of speculation, and you don't know what's going to happen. Of course, much depends, as we just discussed, on who controls the House and who controls the Senate. But even if the Republicans control the Senate and the House, and even if there are margins large enough that would allow them to pass certain bills, I would think on tax incentives, it would be difficult to repeal them for several reasons. One of which, many of those projects are located in red districts. Secondly, I think there's a lot of public support for these projects, even if there is concern about government spending. For instance, I think on the tax credit side, there's certainly a lot of support. It would be unpopular for certain members of Congress to vote against those tax incentives, especially members of Congress that are in so-called swing districts, where they could certainly lose in two years if their constituents don't like how they vote. Then third, I think a number of Republicans wouldn't want to be accused of increasing taxes, which would be the argument if you were to repeal a certain tax incentive. So I wouldn't say that clean energy industry should rest easy if Trump were to win and the Republicans were to control the House and the Senate. But I think there's at least a pretty good chance that they'd be able to save those tax incentives. That is, I think, the consensus view of the industry, that even if Republicans won a narrow majority in the House and Senate and Trump won the presidency, there might be changes around the edges to the IRA, but a wholesale repeal would be unlikely. And a lot of people bring up the fact that 18 Republicans signed a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson saying, do not get rid of these clean energy causes. They're beneficial to our constituents. There is another view out there that the IRA, because the total price tag has been so much higher than the original CBO projections, that it will become such a target that when Trump is trying to pass his tax cuts and is trying to find a way to pay for it, the IRA would be just such an obvious example that even Republicans who at some point opposed repealing it will kind of go along with their president and their party. I think it's a minority view, but it's definitely a concern out there, right? Is that something in your conversations that you're seeing is a fear of the industry? Yeah, definitely. And as I said a second ago, the industry shouldn't rest easy. And that's because the scenario you laid out. It's nice that 18 Republicans signed a letter saying, don't reverse course on these tax credits, but it's easy to sign a letter. It's a lot harder to vote against the bill that most of your party supports, especially if it's like a budget reconciliation bill, which, as you point out, could extend the Trump tax cuts from the previous term as president that are scheduled to expire soon. And then you'd have to bring down the whole bill, essentially, if you voted against that because you didn't like the removal of the tax incentive. So it's something to definitely be concerned about. As you point out, it's the minority view, but it's certainly a realistic possibility. And that's why it's so important. I would thank, first of all, for the clean energy industry. If the Democrats at least have one control of either the House or the Senate, if they lose the presidency or certainly if they win the presidency, there's less of a concern there. But the nightmare scenario is, of course, as you point out, losing the House or not gaining back the House, losing the Senate majority and losing the White House. And then we'll see what happens. But still, I think that if I was a betting man, I would say certainly greater than even chance that most of those tax incentives, maybe not all of them, but most of them could be saved. But Rich, you also talked about some of the things the president can do just through executive action, just with a pen and a phone. And when you look at the IRA, when the IRA was passed, nobody really knew what to make of the various clauses. And a lot of the important information came through these guidances and clarifications that were issued by the administration over the next two plus years. And those aren't complete even today. So even just a Trump presidency without control of Congress, can he really set back the IRA? Is he going to go back and look at these previous guidances and rewrite them in a way that makes it a lot harder for clean energy investors to earn these incentives? Well, any administration can do that. It's a little bit harder if guidance is finalized. So that's why the Treasury Department, I'm sure, is currently working hard to try to finalize as much as they can to the extent or in the event that former President Trump were to win the presidency again. But once guidance is finalized, you'd have to go through a whole new rulemaking process, essentially issuing a proposed set of new guidance. That would then be commented on. And then you'd have to go through, just like any other rulemaking, you'd have to go through notice the comment period. And then after that, change the guidance. So it still could happen. And certainly, I would be concerned about that. But it would at least take several years for that to happen. That's very true. It's also true, I should say, of the EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions and utility generating facilities. That is currently being litigated in the courts right now. But you would expect that if former President Trump were to take office again, his EPA would certainly try to rescind those regulations, assuming they don't die in the courts. And it would just take a while for the administration to go back and have a whole new rulemaking process and remove them. In the meantime, those rules will be in effect at least for another couple of years. And Rich, I just want to jump back because we've been talking about the IRA. But you mentioned we talked about offshore wind. Now, in Trump's first term, it didn't seem like BOEM was particularly hostile to offshore wind. The industry was much more nascent then. But it seemed like things moved along maybe until the last year or two of his administration. Am I recalling that accurately? And why is there the fear that a second term would be more hostile? So you are recalling that accurately. I think that that's correct. And you hear people point that out. And maybe it's more of a feeling than anything else. But I think that the former president hasn't stopped in his criticism. And I think to the extent that depending on it very much would depend on who is the next secretary of interior and who is the next director of the Office of Ocean Energy Management. But I would think that there's a lot of talk about getting loyalists into various important government positions. And I would think they'd be more focused on trying to meet the president's preferences than maybe was the case the first time around, where they were, you know, just getting their feet wet and they had a number of other issues to deal with. Again, I can't say that you're wrong, that that would initially be the case in the second administration. But I have a bad feeling that they would target offshore wind in particular. I was actually listening to the president, the former president's interview on Joe Rogan this weekend. And he was talking about offshore wind, about its effect on whales, its effect on birds. So it doesn't seem like it's a favorite sector for his. But I guess we'll see what materializes once he's, if he ends up in that office. Yes, absolutely. And as we know, his dislike or concern about offshore wind goes way back to when he was trying to develop a golf resort in Scotland. And they were building an offshore wind project near there. And he hasn't let up since then. I remember the lawsuits around that project. And so your background most recently in government was as the chairman of FERC. And the president is the person who appoints people to FERC and also who tabs somebody to serve as chair. If Trump is reelected, presumably he will appoint a Republican. How would a change from a Democratic chairman to a Republican chair of FERC and then maybe eventually to Republican majority control of the commission, what effect would that have? I think your audience well knows FERC is an independent agency and is not supposed to be influenced by the White House, no matter who the president is or the Secretary of Energy is or regardless of that. But having said that, two areas of influence the president has is one, naming the chair and two, nominating new commissioners. Although those new commissioners have to be confirmed by the Senate. In terms of the first hour, in terms of naming the chair, the president on day one, whether it be Vice President Harris or whether it be former President Trump, can designate the chair. That was the case for me. I was designated on inauguration night by President Biden to be the new chair, replacing a Republican chair. And so the chair of FERC has significant influence over the agenda of the commission, not completely because there are certain matters that have to be taken up by statutory requirement regardless. But for the most part, the chair gets to choose what gets brought up for vote, what the commission staff focus on, whether it be policy statements, whether it be rulemakings, whether it be advanced notice of proposal makings, all sorts of actions, activities the commission takes are really under the influence of the chair. So appointing a new chair could have a dramatic impact, at least the commission's agenda for the foreseeable future. And as you point out, also when a position opens up, the president can nominate somebody. Now, typically, as you know, the way the statute works is you can only have three of one party and two of another. Right now you have three Democrats and two Republicans. So if you had a new chair, that chair would have to get the vote of at least one Democrat for initiatives that he or she tries to move forward. But if a commission's position opens up, you know, and there's three Democrats and two Republicans, it could turn to three Republicans and two Democrats relatively quickly, especially if they can get Senate confirmation, which, again, is why it's important who controls the Senate as well, which party controls the Senate. So it could have a dramatic impact on first agenda in the long run. I think in the short term, you wouldn't see much of a change unless commissioners were to leave for some reason or another. Adamantium Well, very interesting. Another thing to keep an eye on. Now, we've been talking this whole time about a potential Trump presidency. And I think it's more interesting because we have a Democrat now, and the assumption is that a Harris administration would represent less of a change than a Trump administration would. But there was also the potential for, you know, for a Democratic presidency, a Democratic House. And though I think it's probably the least likely scenario, even the Democrats holding on to 50, you know, to 50 Senate seats, if there was a Democratic administration, what do you think the priorities would be to build on some of the momentum from the infrastructure bill and the IRA? Well, I think you'd see a couple areas of focus, one of which is obviously continuing to administer the IRA. That means the programs both under the Interior Department and the Energy Department, and the Treasury Department, for that matter. I think you'd continue to see aggressive promotion of the incentives that are included in that statute and other government programs, funding programs, such as loan guarantees, and I mentioned transmission earlier. I think you'd see even a more, a greater emphasis on transmission. I think the current Biden administration, especially Secretary Granholm, which is she just, I think she's done a tremendous job at the Department of Energy, but they've been focused quite a bit on transmission. But I think it's become increasingly clear through the concerns about low growth, through their concerns about extreme weather, their concerns about just some congestion occurring around the country, and also the ability to access remotely located renewable resources. There's a lot of demand for additional transmission capacity. I think you'd see, in addition to carrying out the existing programs that are in the Inflation Reduction Act, you'd see, I think, additional emphasis, both in terms of the administration at the executive branch level, but also in terms of congressional proposals. And one area, one policy, I think, that was left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, during the Inflation Reduction Act debate, was tax incentives for transmission. And I think there's a decent chance you might be able to see that, especially in a Harris administration with a Democratic House and Senate. It seems like transmission could potentially be an area where there's some type of bipartisan support. Is there any Republican support for improving the transmission sector? You know, it's funny you say that, because you would think, if you took a step back and maybe from 10 years ago, if you had said Democrats would be seen as the party promoting electric transmission and Republicans being seen as the party not supporting transmission, or at least not strongly supporting transmission, you would think something weird has happened, right? And so now we're 10 years later, and I think the Democrats are all in on transmission. You see statements from members of Congress and the executive branch and so on. There's been some concerns on the Republican side, some of which has to do with siting. There's been proposals about federal siting of transmission. I think there's been some concerns about using federal eminent domain for certain transmission lines. There's also been concern about certain policies that would, I think, promote transmission development, such as different types of cost allocation that FERC might be able to utilize to promote greater amounts of transmission development. Those are the type of policies that Republicans have expressed some concern about over the last several years. I think you've seen some breakthrough in the Manchin-Barrasso Bill, which is, again, as the state is pending in the Senate, in two areas, one of which that bill removes barriers to siting, at least siting transmission on federal land, for instance, NEPA reform and so on. And there seems to be bipartisan consensus there for the most part. There's some members of both parties that have some concerns, but for the most part, there's a lot of consensus there. The other part of the bill that doesn't get as much play, I think, that is, in my opinion, more important in terms of what's in that bill is the language regarding inter-regional transmission requiring, for instance, there's a provision in the bill that would require FERC to engage in inter-regional transmission planning requirements or impose that requirement upon jurisdictional utilities. And also some language in there making it easier for FERC to spread the cost of transmission more broadly, which I think would certainly remove some of the disincentives to developing transmission that exists today. And so, you know, they got a very strong vote out of the committee, a bipartisan vote. We'll see what happens when Congress returns for the lame duck session as to whether that can be moved across the finish line before Congress adjourns at the end of the year. But I think you're slowly starting to see at least some bipartisan consensus on some transmission issues. There still are some concerns out there, I mentioned before, amongst some Republicans about some of those other provisions. Well, definitely a lot to keep an eye out for in the coming days and whoever ends up leading the next administration. Now, we mentioned that your term at FERC ended last January. And later that year, you helped to launch a consulting firm called GQ New Energy Strategies. Can you tell our listeners a little bit about that venture? Sure. And I would say, first of all, GQ New Energy Strategies has a new name. Now we're called GQS New Energy Strategies, in large part because we added additional person who used to be my last name, Glick, and business partners, Pamela Quinlan, and now Liz Salerno has joined us as well. So that's the GQS. But basically, after I left FERC, I was thinking a lot about what I wanted to do. And I knew I wanted to stay involved in energy issues, especially energy issues related to the clean energy transition. And I saw a need out there, just talking to a bunch of folks in the industry about, I think there needs to be some additional focus on areas such as FERC, such as RTOs, the regional markets around the country, and even the markets that don't have existing RTOs. There's a lot going on there as well. Sat down with, again, I mentioned Pamela Quinlan, who had been our chief of staff at FERC, and we jointly decided to initiate this venture with the idea of, again, focusing on eliminating some of the barriers that exist for the clean energy transition and helping clients navigate those processes. And then Liz Salerno, who was in charge of the transmission agenda at FERC when I was the chair, unfortunately left the commission and agreed to join us after she left. And we're very lucky to have her as well. And between the two of them, the people that had worked at FERC issues over the last several years know how brilliant they are and how involved they are in all the issues that are popping up around the country. And it's just a pleasure to be able to work with them again and to be able to work on the issues that I feel strongly about. So if there is a Kamala Harris administration, have you given any thought to returning to government or are you done with the public sector for good? I'm done with the public sector. First of all, I feel very lucky to have been able to spend five years at FERC and before that work at the Department of Energy, I mentioned earlier, and also work on Capitol Hill. But I think my time in the government has come and gone. The experience I had most recently when the president nominated me for a second term and Chairman mentioned decided he didn't want to give me a hearing to move my nomination forward. At that point, I said, you know, that's it for my government service. I respect people that do this. It's very much very important, but I don't really want to go through that again. So I like where I am and it's a little less pressure, which is nice, too. We certainly have accomplished enough in government for one lifetime, right? I appreciate that. That's very nice of you to say. Well, Rich, thank you so much for coming on your show. I think it's a really interesting and, like I said, a really timely conversation. And we'll have to have you back again once the dust settles in the election and the new administration to talk about the state of play. Glad to do it and appreciate your invite. And thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, Senior Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is at the forefront of the energy and renewable energy insurance industry. He is Jeffrey Lev, head of U.S. accounts for KWH Analytics. Jeff, thank you for joining the program today. Hi, Andrew. Thanks a lot for having me. Excited to be here. Well, we're excited to have you on, and I'm sure our listeners are excited. For listeners who aren't as familiar, can you tell me a little bit about what KWH Analytics does, where you're focused in the industry? Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. KWH Analytics, a lot of folks might know us from our first product. We've been around for about 10 years. Our first product in the industry was a solar revenue put, which is probably the area where we're most known, as well as some of the insights that we put out within the industry. But at our core, we're a data company. So we started by writing software and organizing data in the renewables industry, mostly solar data. We amassed a data set of over 300,000 solar assets. And then we evolved through analysis of that data into an insurance underwriter today. So today we are using that data to underwrite risk more accurately than those who don't have the data or then even than ourselves before we before we had amassed the level we do today. We are very focused on data and the crossroads of data and insurance, pun intended. And when did you make that shift from just focusing on the data to entering the insurance market? I'm curious how that took place. Yeah, good question. We're a little over a decade old. We spent the first about three years of our existence really building a software platform that organized that data. So it was called Helio stats. It's still in existence today, mostly used by portfolio managers in the space. And then about seven years ago, we developed a solar revenue put. And that's where a lot of the impetus of even the stuff that we're doing today and what we're going to talk about later in this podcast with on the wind side. But the idea behind our work was that we were really marrying or putting together risk transfer with the project finance sector. What we did and what the what our first product did seven years ago was it took performance risk and it analyzed that in such a way that we were able to transfer that risk to an insurance counterparty, get them comfortable with taking it, basically take it off the hands of lenders who had been holding it historically. It's interesting. I think a lot of people who are not in the industry aren't aware of what a big role risk transfer and insurance plays for the renewable sector. Longtime listeners of Crossroads are aware. We've had we've had several guests on to talk about this, but it's really just an important part of the industry that a lot of people don't think about. Now, Jeff, what is your background? How long have you been with KWH Analytics and where were you before joining the firm? Sure. Yeah. So I've been with KWH for about two years now and basically taken on a role related to the sales and distribution of our products. So head of U.S. accounts is a sales and distribution role where we are working to innovate and tailor products, insurance products for use in the renewable space. Prior to this, so I spent the first decade of my career doing banking. Most of that was project finance banking, mostly wind, solar, some some other renewables. I will admit I've done some oil and gas assets and some thermal assets as well. Actually, my first project was a coal plant. But generally speaking, a renewables person. I then spent about seven years doing the development side of renewables. So I worked at Engie for about five and a half years and then some other development shops. My experience is both finance related and business development. Well, it seems like you must give you a very wide view of the industry, which is must be helpful when you're working on these deals. Yeah. So the way we think of insurance, I mean, we think of insurance as risk capital. Right. I mean, historically, insurance wasn't much more than a project expense. And when I started working and for really the first half of my career, insurance was really a project expense. We think it serves really three key purposes. So, you know, you can use insurance effectively to boost access to financing, to enhance the financing. You can use it to support innovation, which is one of the ways that we're doing today. And you can you can de-risk regulatory uncertainty, which we're seeing, you know, post IRA. And then you are also seeing for a number of years with, you know, an example is tax insurance. We think the insurance markets have a lot to offer to the project space. And we think that sort of organizing the data around these risks will help better transfer or reduce cost of that risk transfer. Well, it's very interesting. And thank you for that explanation. Now, readers of InfraLogic might remember an article I wrote in July about a wind proxy hedge risk transfer product that KWH Analytics played a role in shaping to back a 59 megawatt wind farm in Maine called Moscow Wind. And that was really touted at the time as very innovative and first of its kind. And we wrote an article about that. I've wanted to have you or someone from your firm on the podcast ever since that, because I thought that was really interesting and worth going a little bit more in depth into. Can you talk about about how that product came about and what made it so innovative? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Andrew. That that was very exciting, very exciting project. So the wind proxy hedge that we put on for Moscow Wind, this was a greenbacker project. The circumstance around this project wasn't incredibly unique. I mean, this was this was a wind asset in Maine with fairly normal distribution. They had some tail risk associated with the asset. So what I mean by that is that their P99 debt sizing constraint was fairly constraining. They were bumping up against that. And so in essence, the sponsor was unable to unlock additional debt value on that asset because of what amounted to what we would call in in basic parlance, a low P99. What we did was we looked at the reasons why that tail risk existed. So we call that tail risk. Basically, it's the tail of the curve. We looked at the reasons why it existed. It exists on many wind assets. In this case, it was really wind speed driven. This sponsor had done a good job really mitigating the risk on the availability side. And so it was really wind speed driven. And so there are products in the insurance space. They had never been used in this way before, but there are products in the insurance space that can basically set a floor on that wind speed. So you can have a rated counterparty in this case, basically providing a derivative product that offers a floor. You can also write it as insurance, but let's just call it risk transfer, a product that sets a floor on that wind speed. And by setting a floor on that wind speed above the level that the bank would otherwise be sizing debt, we were able to unlock more value. So this was a case where, and I talked about those three sort of key factors that insurance can offer. One of them is unlocking additional financing or just unlocking value within a financing. We often call it credit enhancement, but in this case, we were able to get about 22% additional indebtedness. And what we did was we all took advantage of an arbitrage opportunity. We reduced the price or the cost of holding that risk. And that was by transferring it to a counterparty that was better suited to hold that risk. In this case, insurance, an insurance company. One thing I would mention on products like that, you know, historically you would look at weather derivatives, other risk transfer products. And they oftentimes, one of the limiting factors was just tenor. How long could you transfer this risk for? And when historically you have that 25 to 30 year live assets in project finance, I think they're even longer now. Putting on a trade for one to three years doesn't solve much of a financing concern. It might solve some risk transfer, but it doesn't really settle a financing concern. That was something that KWH dealt with early on through the solar revenue put and have been able to, you know, utilize in other space like the wind proxy hedge, where we were able to get a much longer live risk transfer product. This one actually transferred the risk for a full 20 years. We've done it for up to about 26 years and can go to the useful life of assets. So that's a big differentiator now. Something, a reason to look into more of these risk transfer products now because they can go out to the life of the longer life assets or project finance assets. So obviously wind deals and the type of transactions around them are nothing new. Why is this type of a hedge just kind of hitting the market now? Is there a greater need for it or is it just an innovation that hadn't been presented before? It's a really good question. So there's a couple nuances to the answer. So the first one is that the industry will evolve into a reliable structure. We were mostly targeting lenders, potentially tax equity investors with products that would add value to their financing. And the market will evolve around a structure that will generally protect their investment. Right. So that's happened on partnership flips. Of course, that's happened on wind assets. And more recently it's happened on solar assets. So the market sort of converges around debt service coverage ratios they're comfortable with and other constraints or project measures that allow lenders and tax equity investors to be comfortable with their investment. I think we're getting to the point of maturity where you're starting to see that you end up with a lot of competition around the asset acquisition. And people need to get or sponsors need to get more innovative around what they're doing. There's a lot of people who can acquire an asset from a developer and then ultimately bring it to operating. To do that efficiently and to do that in a way that provides acceptable economic return or financial returns to investors has gotten more challenging. It used to be easier, of course, and you don't necessarily pick up all the price from a PPA anymore. There's a lot of merchant considerations in there to creating value out of these projects. Another way to create value out of these projects is financial engineering. So I think it's just sort of part of the maturity of the industry and just looking for ways to wring out additional dollars from not charging more to your end-use customer. That's where it's coming from today. So I'm looking at this article from July in front of me. And at the time you said that this is a very replicable structure. It's highly applicable across the board for wind projects. And you anticipated to see more deals modeled after this one. I know it's only been it was July, so it's been not even three months. But have you seen that starting to happen? Has this become a model for the industry? Well, Andrew, as you know, InfraLogic has a vast reach. So we did receive a lot of a lot of inquiries post that article coming out. So thank you very much for that. They call it the InfraLogic effect. Yes, the InfraLogic effect. Thank you for that. We do. We actually got some inquiries from some large sponsors who are looking at utilizing a wind proxy hedge in a little bit different way. So we're actually now looking at a way to deal with some regulatory challenges, one in particular in PJM. In order to participate in the capacity markets in PJM, it's important that you are available. Capacity markets anywhere. But for renewables, that's not as easy as it is for conventional power assets, of course. So making sure that you're going to be available at the times of highest demands or lowest supply are key. If you can tie those high demand points and those low supply points to some data set that is understandable, replicable, like wind speed or a measure of freezing or a measure of high heat, some other condition that insurers can get comfortable with the nature of and the distribution of, then you can provide products that can support these types of regulatory considerations. So we're looking at that. We are looking at a couple of the same form wind proxy hedges that would unlock additional indebtedness. Actually, quick side story. So I got a call from a CFO yesterday, a major solar sponsor who is looking at, he wants to solve an anticipated issue. He sees an issue related to his equipment. It is coming. He wants to solve it for the next 20 years. And there's not many people you can call and there's not much that you can do to solve a problem for 20 years. I think that's where we've differentiated ourselves and found a way to sort of build on what was unlocking longer term, longer term risk transfer. You know, KWH specifically is excited by challenges like this, like we're going to have this equipment issue. How do we deal with it? Can somebody support it for the long term? And do they have a balance sheet? And then do you have the expertise to convince or, I would say, put together a product? It's really not convincing because these are smart folks. Put together a product that lenders or tax equity will find acceptable. So we kind of thrive on that brainstorming and innovation around solutions. And, you know, we really look to use our insurance acumen as well as our project finance background to marry the two in a form that the industry can benefit from. So, Jeff, are there any other innovative products? So what's going to be the next InfraLogic breaking news story on an innovative tax structure that KWH is working on? Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah, look, in order to innovate, you need data. Or at least we need data. There's a couple areas that I think are really interesting and where we're starting to get more data and better analyze and use that data. We're in this area now where battery energy storage is growing massively. The IRA enabled that. And also, there's good use for it on the grid. A lot of use cases. We think that there's a possibility to create more certainty and some products around that. We also, I would say, I mean, if you think about InsureTech and the nature of InsureTech. I mean, InsureTech is sector specific, right? InsureTech is in young industries like renewables where there just isn't readily available data and it sits with small entities. So as we share that data more and as we are able to use and model it, we can just provide more insights and more products will come up. I think the one we've gotten most requests for is probably on the battery side, which will take some time to work through. Right now, we are doing a lot of innovation around the property side of our business. So we started traditional property insurance about two years ago. And in the traditional property space, it's generally been just rising rates over the past several years. I think there was 13% annual growth projected through 2030 in the renewable space for insurance premiums. Something that we can only solve by better analyzing the risk and mitigating it. We're focused on areas where there's either a broken system or where risk reduction or risk transfer can help enable more projects to be built. We just want more renewables and more projects getting done. Sorry, I can't tell you tomorrow what it's going to be, but there is some interesting data that's being shared now and that we are working to develop products from. Do you think some of these challenges around property insurance have held back the solar industry at all or held back renewables? I wouldn't say they've held back renewables. The renewables industry is incredibly resilient, especially solar. I do think that this cost has to be passed on somewhere. And if we're effectively building assets in the wrong place, or we're not mitigating these risks appropriately for the perils that these assets might see, then we're doing a bit of a disservice to the industry. So I think our goal, and I know the sponsor's goal, is to have long-term operating assets at very high availabilities. The industry is really working to get there. So we're picking appropriate equipment for locations. We're dealing with perils in an appropriate way. So, for instance, hail is a big issue for the solar industry. Hail has been a major issue that has really reared its head starting in 2019 with Midway. And I think there are several sponsors who have been really effectively dealing with it. So we've seen some really nice mitigation of hail. It doesn't mean that you absolutely need to change a location, but that's really the most difficult thing to do. What you do is pick the right equipment and implement the right stove protocols. And we've seen that start to really embed within the industry. So I wouldn't say it's held the industry back. Solar deals with all kinds of tariff issues and equipment-related and other. And solar will be resilient and we deal with hail as well. But what we've seen most recently is that there's a clear focus on long-term, stable, strong operations. And this is both to benefit sponsors as well as investors. So I think it's a very resilient industry that is constantly strengthening. So, no, not held back in my view. Well, very interesting, but obviously a very important challenge to solve nonetheless. Well, Jeff, I'm afraid we're out of time, but this has been a great conversation. And thank you again for joining the Crossroads podcast. And if listeners want to learn more about your firm, where should they go? Yeah, please take a look at kwhanalytics.com. My contact information's up there. And, you know, the thing, the note I'd leave with in summary is there are these opportunities out there to use risk transfer. You know, and use the insurance market to your benefit if you're a sponsor today. We're ready to dig in on a challenge if you share it with us. Well, I'm excited to see what's next from your standpoint. Thank you again, Jeff. Thanks a lot, Andrew. Appreciate it. And thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, senior editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. We have a great guest today. Jonathan Weiner is the co-founder and co-CEO of Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure firm backed by Google parent company Alphabet and headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. Jonathan, thank you for coming on the program. Thanks for having me. So Jonathan, for listeners who might not be so familiar with Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, can you talk a little bit about the company and where your focus is in the infrastructure sector? Sure. So Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners is focused exclusively on the application of technology to infrastructure systems, specifically how can we make infrastructure more resilient, more sustainable, more inclusive by leveraging technology in both the design and operation of infrastructure systems. We work across sort of the major core sectors within infrastructure. So energy, digital, mobility, and other forms of infrastructure, and we've been operating as independent companies and spinning out of Alphabet about five years ago. So this company is about five years old. And Jonathan, where did you work before joining Sidewalk? Well, I started my career very early as a software entrepreneur, actually briefly dropped out of college to do my first software startup, but then spent about the first decade of my career in alternative asset management working for a large firm here in New York called D.E. Shaw. And then I spent about a decade after that running two alternative energy infrastructure funds that were focused on how we could apply alternative energy generation to the Asian market specifically. So you've had a very interesting career across multiple continents. Yes. So as somebody who's worked in the infrastructure sector for pretty much your whole career for decades, you've seen somewhat of a shift in infrastructure as an asset class. I'm curious, how does Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners define infrastructure? And do you think that definition is changing? Well, specifically now talking about infrastructure as an asset class, so thinking about it from sort of the financial fundamentals that underpin the risk return of infrastructure assets as opposed to sort of a broader societal definition of what constitutes infrastructure. I think there really has been an explosion in the asset class, let's call it, over the last 15-ish years, where we've seen a tremendous amount of capital formation. And a lot of that capital formation is in what people might commonly refer to as core or core plus infrastructure assets. And we think about what was driving a lot of that capital formation, it was largely thinking about infrastructure as a financial instrument. We were in a relatively low interest rate environment. And here you had fixed assets that can provide steady yields. And it was something of a fixed income financial product, but not necessarily thinking of it as an asset class that generated other types of risk-adjusted return. And I'm reminded actually early in my career, I mentioned before I was a software entrepreneur, and I dropped out of college to do a startup, and we commonly used to refer to it as venture capital. And venture capital was broadly the asset class at the time. You think about the explosion that happened in the last several decades with the amount of capital going into early-stage companies, and now you have very nuanced understanding of that asset class or sub-asset classes in seed, pre-seed even, or Series A or growth or pre-IPO. And something similar has started to happen within infrastructure as an asset class. So in addition to sort of the more traditional aspects of core and core plus infrastructure, I think people are just starting to ask of the asset class, where's the best risk-adjusted return? Not necessarily the very specific fixed income style returns that were the basis of infrastructure for a long time. And what we see is one of the real opportunities there sits at the intersection of infrastructure and technology. The technology is fundamentally changing these assets. But if you have an early-stage technology company, you might be able to raise a Series A, a Series B, a Series C from a venture capitalist. But the moment you say to that venture capitalist, hey, I need to invest in real assets that can't provide the type of multiples that you need in the winners in your portfolio, they'll say, hey, look, got to keep this business model asset light, I'm looking for a home run. Likewise, if you go to the core, core plus infrastructure folks and you say, hey, I want to scale up a proven technology that provides better asset level efficiency, return, sustainability, they might say, hey, I'm sorry, what we do is we do large-scale investments where there is no technology risk, where there is no growth risk. And so there's really a missing middle in infrastructure as an asset class right now. It's really the opportunity that we're trying to target where we're almost growth equity, if you will, within infrastructure where we're scaling up new approaches to infrastructure that provide stronger risk-adjusted return. So that's definitely a trend that we've been seeing in the last few years. I think anybody who works in the infrastructure sector or covers the infrastructure sector has noticed that, has seen investments that you don't traditionally think of as infrastructure type investments, especially when it comes to technology. But my question is, how do you make sure you're still fulfilling the kind of basic tenets of an infrastructure investment, that if it's somewhere within the infrastructure asset class when you're investing in these technologies? I really think a lot about the risk-adjusted return of the investment, specifically the contractual risk mitigation that might sit within the transaction and the type of services that are being provided. So I think it's really important that the assets that you are financing, whether they're technologically enabled or not, are providing critical services, right? At the end of the day, that is a core part. Effectively, the services you're providing are non-discretionary, if you will. They are things that are the demand for which are well understood. And the contractual structures under which both the asset is constructed or developed have some element of risk mitigation in them, and that the revenues are effectively contracted under long-term contracts of one form or another. That sort of creates the bubble or the wrapper contractually or from a risk-return profile that we think of as infrastructure. But within that, what risks you take, whether they are regulatory risk, construction risk, technology risk, and what level of return you need to get within that type of contractual framework, I think that's where we're seeing the new asset class evolve. What's accelerated it to a certain degree is the type of assets that society most needs now might not be the same type of infrastructure assets we were building 10 years ago. It's become so common to use the phrase energy transition, probably an overused phrase, quite frankly. What that phrase really did is it helped people understand that the type of physical assets that we were using before, whether that be generation itself or the grid or associated forms of infrastructure, were going to have to be different if we wanted to change the underlying source of energy generation to be intermittent renewables from thermal power that's baseload effectively. You need both different generation, different forms of demand management, thinking about storage and other ways to modernize the grid. That story was very easy on some level to understand. It was forced upon the asset class as society and governments pushed for greater and greater renewables and decarbonization broadly defined. I think there's an emerging awareness now that it's not just an energy transition that we're going through right now, it's an infrastructure transition overall. Mobility technologies are changing dramatically. The way they were able to move goods and people and provide public transit using technology can be far more efficient, far more sustainable, and far more inclusive by leveraging technology. Certainly in digital, if you think about what's going to be necessary, whether that be for the compute that's necessary to underlie things like AI or just enterprise cloud compute more generally, and what's going to need to be true of the infrastructure that delivers that, or even as we think about 5G, what type of infrastructure could provide ubiquitous high-speed, low-latency communications. These are all transitions from the way that we have historically thought about digital infrastructure or historically thought about mobility infrastructure or energy infrastructure. Because those sectors are changing and the type of assets that society needs are evolving, I think the asset class is coming to the realization, wow, there's a really interesting opportunity if we can figure out how to finance the leading developers of these new forms of infrastructure. Can you give any examples where Sidewalk has been investing in that space? What are some investments that you've made that you feel falls into that infrastructure technology segment? Yeah, I'll maybe comment on a couple quickly. Actually, one that I think is an interesting one that gets at the heart of the question you were just asking me, which is what's the difference between technology-enabled infrastructure and traditional infrastructure? We have a significant investment in a company called Renew Home. What Renew Home does is it builds large-scale residential virtual power plants. A lot of jargon, but what it really means is that we have technology software that works with homeowners to control how and when they use electricity, and we aggregate at this point over a million homes across the country and dispatch or control how we release that energy into the energy grid, and they get paid by the grid for what you can think of as sophisticated demand management, but we think of as a virtual power plant, effectively reducing the amount of power the grid needs to consume at moments when generation is most in demand. Now, the reason I use that as an example is I think there's a really nice, you can almost imagine the slide. I actually once made this slide, which was comparing sort of a natural gas peaker plant on one side against this residential virtual power plant, and certainly every investor in infrastructure understands how to underwrite a natural gas peaker plant, understands they're going to fund this amount of CapEx roughly, this amount of OpEx roughly. You're going to enter into, depending on where you build it and what market, certain types of commercial contracts, and effectively what you're doing is helping the grid at its peak moments, spin up relatively high marginal cost electricity, but under contracts whereby it's standing by and being able to provide that necessary capacity at the peak moments, you're able to recoup your investment with a certain type of return profile. That's easily understandable. Let me give you a contrast. In our virtual power plant, if you look at the dollar per kilowatt to control a kilowatt on the grid that we're able to dispatch, it's a very, very small fraction of a natural gas peaker plant. We enter into the exact same contracts as a natural gas peaker plant in California, for example, we're able to enter into resource adequacy contracts and also to participate in the energy markets. It's just that our payback and our IRR on that is far higher than you would typically see in a natural gas peaker plant. Obviously our construction timelines and costs are far lower, so we can actually build more of this on the grid sooner. A reasonable infrastructure investor might say to me, hey, Jonathan, what's the infrastructure asset? You basically have a piece of software talking to a bunch of thermostats and solar and storage systems and EVs and homes. That's not infrastructure. I would challenge you, if you put the risk return of those two things next to each other, keep in mind we're providing the same service to the grid for the same types of contracted revenues under a similar methodology of how you calculate load and dispatch, one is just a better risk-adjusted return than the other, and they both are effectively infrastructure. I could give more examples. I don't want to use the whole podcast to do so, but I think it's one really great example of the contrast between traditional infrastructure and technology-enabled infrastructure. How do you make sure you have the high barriers to entry to make sure that it fits within the infrastructure asset class? I think that's one thing that some might find challenging. First of all, I think when people use the phrase high barrier to entry, that can mean a lot of different things even in traditional infrastructure. I think there's the policy component to that and the regulatory component to barrier to entry, the high capex, the difficulty in getting a big asset built. Those might be what you would typically see within a natural gas peaker plant, as I just described. But here you have an extraordinarily high barrier to entry. One, you have to develop, in this case, a very large-scale software system that requires tremendous amounts of historic data to train its machine learning algorithms to be able to accurately predict how much energy we're able to dispatch. That can take years, and it has taken us years to perfect. And then, of course, the major barrier to entry is the customer. We have spent years acquiring these customers, providing incentives for them to buy devices or to enroll their devices into our system. And then we've entered into long-term contracts on the other side with the offtakers. It's a different long-term barrier to entry. It's far more technology. It is far less, you know, I happen to own this piece of land that uniquely cite this asset. So it is different in some sense. But I would argue no less of a barrier to entry and, quite frankly, a space where the returns are so far in excess of traditional infrastructure that you could probably justify a little bit more risk than you might otherwise see. Well, very interesting. I mean, it's certainly true that the definition of infrastructure is ever-shifting. So thank you for that explanation. Now, shifting gears a little bit, last month, InfraLogic published an article co-bylined by myself and my colleague, Matt O'Brien. It was headlined, How Investors Are Solving the Data Center Power Problem. If you are a subscriber, you can go back and you can read that article. What it covered was the challenge that data centers, really because of the rapid growth of AI, pose for the energy sector and the strain that they are putting on the grid. And regular listeners of this podcast, remember that this has been a topic we've been focused on for quite some time. In February, Will Smales of Morrison was on the podcast and was discussing this very challenge for the industry. But as readers of that article know, John, you think that data centers, rather than being a drain on the grid, can really serve as a grid resource. Can you explain a little bit why you feel this way and how they can serve that function? Sure. And I think this is one of the most interesting evolutions and disruptions that's happening in infrastructure right now. Data centers as an asset class and certainly as a sector within core or core plus infrastructure, we're really looking at a 10, 15-year window here that that's been considered part of core and core plus infrastructure. And during that period of time, effectively the problem that data center developers, whether that was within a large hyperscaler, sort of their business unit that developed data centers, or third-party data center developers, the fundamental problem that they were trying to solve was how to provide the level of uptime and reliabilities, often referred to as five-nines reliability, that were necessary under the SLAs, under the contracts by which enterprise cloud was being solved. So you have a bunch of folks who say, I have a website, and when you click on my website, it better load. And in order to do that, I need to have five-nines reliability from my cloud partner. And the cloud partner turns around either internally or with a third-party data center development group and says, you better deliver five-nines reliability. And the way folks did that was to effectively build in redundancy, particularly in the energy management systems within data centers. So long-duration backup through diesel generators, often combined with UPS or short-duration storage at the server level or in the data center. They'd get in the interconnect queue and say, hey, I need a lot of power for this thing. I need 10 megawatts, 100 megawatts, whatever it is. And then they would draw that power in this highly variable fashion. But at the end of the day, they weren't trying to solve a power problem. They were trying to solve a reliability and availability. And they'd rather have 2N engineering, excess power that they never brushed up against the limits of, excess CapEx, but to be able to hit that five-nines availability. And I think a few things have started to shift. The first thing that started to shift is that data center developers now need to think of their customer not just as the tenant or even the user of the compute behind the tenant, but they actually need to realize that the data center has two customers, the tenant and the utility. So at the end of the day, it's no longer going to be the case, particularly in energy-constrained markets, where you can just sort of put your name into an interconnect queue, draw power in this highly variable way that effectively drives up the rate base for other types of consumers and puts all types of strain on the grid as you scale up and down your power usage, but making sure that you always deliver five-nines. And so what we think needs to happen, and obviously talking our book a little bit because we own a data center development platform that is focused on these new types of energy management systems, but we think that the data center needs to be able to be a resource to the grid in the way that you just described, Andrew. Effectively, in the same way that I was talking about load shedding during peak moments or islanding the consumption, we think the data center needs to be able to say, hey, we're going to think about the load duration curve of the utility. And during the peak hours where you're not actually able to currently meet your demand, we will reduce our demand or island ourselves at the data center. In the case of our data centers, where we have long-duration storage, energy storage as backup, even dispatch energy into the grid in exchange for being able to procure the interconnection to use power the rest of the year. We get into a lot of the detail there, but part of what enables that to happen is a rethinking of the energy management system of a data center to please both your tenant and the utility. It's a rethinking to customers in your design. Part of it also goes to this question of the future of compute and whether or not we're going to see more and more AI training compute, which is batchable, which is to say that same level of five nines reliability is not necessary. And if that's the case, by co-locating different types of compute, could you achieve a similar type of outcome while also being able to support the grid? A really fascinating question of what is the future of data center development look like? And again, asking this question, it's not necessarily the case that the data centers that we've built for the last 10, 15 years are necessarily the data centers that we're going to build for the next 10 or 15 years. And when you say five nines reliability, you mean 99.999% reliable? That's right. Just to kind of summarize, when you're talking about the different types of data centers, some might not have that ability to say, we're going to be dispatching to the grid when it's convenient or giving back to the grid when it's convenient. Some it might be as it's called. But when it comes to something like AI learning, that can be active when it's convenient for the grid. Am I summarizing that correctly? That's right. I mean, it is the case that AI training can be paused in a way that other types of compute cannot be paused. And so this leads to a question, of course, latency or the time to conduct compute is less of a constraint on AI compute, which opens up a number of different geographic questions of how you do compute. But independent of this question of AI compute versus, let me call it CPU or enterprise cloud compute or traditional compute, whatever you want to call it. I think even if you ignored that question, I think the batch ability of AI compute creates more flexibility. But even without that flexibility, you should just think about the delivery of enterprise cloud compute. I think if you built the data center in a different way and built your energy backup system in our case using storage, but there are other approaches to be far more flexible, you could still provide the same level of reliability to your end customer while also being able to say to the grid, hey, tell me how many hours a year I need to be able to island myself or even dispatch power back into the grid. And again, by being able to serve both of those customers, I think you'll unlock far more data center capacity, which of course is the challenge that we're finding right now. We can't grow in an energy constrained data center markets because there just isn't enough generation and transmission. So looking forward, there is because of AI going to be significant increase of power demand. It's unclear if the grid or if the power supply is going to be able to accommodate. When you look at the different types of data centers that are needed, what percentage of that are the type that will be dispatchable? Is this just going to be a little bit of a drop of the ocean or a limited solution? Or do you think this could really solve the problem? No, I'm reminded of an analogy that I've heard several times, which I think is very relevant. It relates to commercial office space, real estate. You have a class A building in the most desirable part of town with the best footprint, with the best technology and facade, and it can charge a premium lease rate. It's class A for some number of years until it isn't, right? Somebody else has a different floor plan or a different part of town becomes popular. Then ultimately, something that once was class A can become a class B office building. That doesn't necessarily mean they won't have any tenants, but it might not be able to command the exact same type of lease premium or low vacancy rates that a class A building is able to. I think we're going to see something similar in data centers, which is not to say that the data centers that exist today are not going to find tenants or not going to have valuable capacity, but rather the future users of data centers, and particularly ones that are paying the highest lease rates, are going to demand more of their data centers. They're going to demand the ability to facilitate different types of compute, depending upon the nature of the compute that is necessary, which requires a different approach to thinking about the basis of design for a data center, but not just the end users that might also, for example, have sustainability requirements or other things that might lead them to a more sophisticated, flexible data center design. I think in order to get interconnect, certainly in the top markets, there will be increasing constraints put on data center developers. This gets to your question of, will this be a drop in the bucket or something broader? My sense is that particularly in power constraint markets, but I think there will be leaders and other people will follow them. The system operators will say, okay, we're willing to welcome data centers onto our grid. We're willing to provide interconnect, and that can be a resource to our business models and can make sense for our communities, but if and only if the following things are true. What they're not going to allow folks to do is to just speculate in interconnect queues, to not use power in an efficient way, drive up energy costs for other people by increasing the rate base where they're being developed and using a relatively low percentage of power, but yet requiring the worst hours in a low duration curve. I just don't think that utilities, as they've understood what this load represents and its growth, are going to continue to allow it to grow in the way it has grown historically. Again, this comes to your barrier of entry question from before. I think the market could change in a dramatic way, not simply because folks like us are building different data centers, but because the energy utilities themselves start requiring evolution of data centers. Well, that's very interesting. This question of data centers, AI, and the power supply has been a major theme for the energy renewable and for the telecoms industry in 2024, and if you go to conferences, if you read the papers that are being put out, I'm sure you're well aware of that, and it's something to keep following. Well, a lot more to talk about, but I think we're just about out of time. Jonathan, thank you so much for coming on the program. We'll have to have you back soon. Thanks for having me.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter and deputy managing editor for Infralogix North American News Coverage. I'll be your host again today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today, someone who's going to give us a close look at the data center industry, some of the financings trends that we've been identifying in our news coverage recently. We're going to revisit some of the power constraint issues that have been well talked about for some time now, and other trends that are going on in the sector. I have with me databank CEO, Raoul Martinek. Raoul, thanks for joining us today. How are you doing? Great, Matt. Thanks for having me. Absolutely. Yeah, I've been looking forward to this one for quite some time, a whole summer actually. Finally, we're making it happen. Just to kick things off, obviously, our readers are always interested in the latest financing, latest financing deals, trends, where are yields going, what's the latest financing structure to get our project across the finish line. We've been seeing a lot of and hearing about a lot of data center yield code deals. A decade ago, we were writing about these for the renewables industry. At first, they were all the rage, and then petered out, and now they've resurfaced again here in the data center industry. For a couple of years now, I've been listening to industry executives talk about alternative financing mechanisms, aside from your traditional bank loans, project finance, JVs, preferred equity. Let's home in on the yield code stuff. I just wanted to get your take first for listeners who might not be entirely familiar with, maybe just a quick couple of seconds on what is it? Why are operators using it? Why is it a compelling investment opportunity for investors, if you could get into that part of it too? I'd love to hear your take on it. Absolutely, Matt, and a lot to impact there. When it comes to yield code specifically, it's a term that we use when we unlock cash on what's called the fully stabilized asset. When we build a data center, we're typically building that before we have an anchor customer or tenants. At that point, you obviously are funding the capital to build that facility. When it gets to a point of stabilization where it's largely leased, now that becomes a yielding asset. It's generating positive NOI. What a lot of developers have done is, they will then package up that asset or a set of assets that are in that state, that stabilized state, and then basically sell them to investors that are looking for that cash yield, typically at a cap rate. That's what we talk about as a yield code. To step back a second on your question around financing, and yes, financing has really become a central issue in the data center sector. It's really because of the scale that the sector has gone. When I joined DataBank seven years ago, the data center sector was a lot smaller. Transactions were typically measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion or two billion, and that was a function of the size of these data centers. When we build data centers, we think of things, everything in terms of power, and a data center, we measure that in megawatts. Let's take a 10-megawatt data center. That costs us about $10 million per megawatt, so that building is going to be $100 million. A 10-megawatt data center, seven years ago, was really one of the larger envelopes that you would find in the space. With the growth in technology adoption, public cloud growth, and, obviously, most recently, generative AI, the demands of data center capacity have increased rather significantly. Now, all of a sudden, we're building 60-megawatt data centers or 72-megawatt data centers. The numbers have all turned into the billions from the hundreds of millions five-plus years ago. What that's done to the sector is we really had to look at how we're going to finance that growth. Yield codes are one way of doing it, as we just talked about. Those are really for developers that create an SPV around a specific asset, maybe get a promote with it, maybe put in a little bit of their equity, raise a bunch of LP capital with it. It's really a business at a building level. Data Bank, we're an operating company. We own and operate about 70 data centers across the country. We're similar to the two public comps, Equinix and Digital Realty, so we're not really looking to sell our assets because they're part of our operating platform. For that, we haven't yet done a yield code type of deal. On the debt side, what we have done is we've transitioned from five years ago on a bank debt, as you mentioned. Back then, it was a Term Loan A or a Term Loan B type of structure, typically a four-by-two or type of leverage structure. We pioneered in 2021 the first multi-tenant data center securitization. That's really what's become our main method for raising capital on the debt side. We take our data centers, the contracts in our data centers, we work with the rating agencies, in our case, Kroll, and we're able to create investment-grade bonds that we can then sell to ABS investors, which, as you know, is a massively deep pool of capital. We've issued, in four separate tranches, over $2.2 billion of securitized bonds. We will continue to do that as we develop assets, stabilize them, and then make them eligible to be contributed into a securitization tranche. Understood. Data Bank won't be doing any yield codes anytime soon. I think I heard you say that, correct? That's correct. Expand on that, though, real quick. Essentially, I don't know if there's ownership of the assets transferred to the group of investors. You guys are looking to avoid that. I'm wondering if you could just expand on those thoughts real quick. Yeah. I'll give you an example of a company that has done yield codes, Vantage, which is a sister company of Data Bank. When I say sister company in that we share a lead investor, Digital Bridge, which is a public infrastructure manager that invests in these digital assets. In their case, their business is building data centers really for a small set of customers, mainly the hyperscale customers, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. A lot of their data centers are single-tenant, and they're single-tenant and leased under very long-duration contracts. It's really a one-and-done type of activity, while on our side, we're building a data center and we're bringing in multiple tenants. Just think of an office building where there's 50 tenants in that, and there's a lot of lease turnover over the years. There's a way to increase NOI through escalators and through rising renewal rates. On the stabilized side, on the hyperscale side, once you've leased that data center to a hyperscale tenant, again, there isn't much you can do to increase NOI in that property other than what the contract says. That is why those assets tend to be more ideal for selling into these yield codes. Vantage has done that where they've created a subsidiary where they've put a bunch of these assets in there. They've maintained operational control over those assets because the customers still want that company to maintain the infrastructure. Data centers are very different than other real estate asset classes where, as a landlord, there's a very, very heavy involvement in the maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure. These buildings are very complex technologically from a cooling, from a power, from a security, from a compliance perspective. That's an ongoing obligation that we have as the landlord. The tenants really care that the landlord stays involved in the property and continues to deliver the uptime, the security, and the compliance that's required to house this data. In any event, Vantage has done that and has been able to create liquidity through that and then recycle that capital either in the form of a dividend to shareholders or to reinvest in a dev code type facility, which is building greenfield data centers that are in that early state of lease up. That's kind of the two methods that some companies have used in the space, the yield code, dev code kind of combination. For folks that are familiar with industrial, a sector prologist is probably the greatest example of a very sophisticated capital structure where there's a set of operating entities and a set of yield code and dev code facilities to be able to continue to invest in new development. Thank you for that. Just going back to the debt piece, a lot of our subscribers are project finance bankers. I've gone to industry conferences, executives that talk about an expectation to see data center operators use more project finance. I've even talked about that on this podcast with others before. I'd like to know, do you have a view on project finance? Is that something that Data Bank is considering? What are your views on that trend? In addition to the securitization, that's our primary instrument for debt formation. We also have two other facilities that we've used. One is a dev code facility. A dev code facility is basically a bank facility. In our case, we raised it earlier this year. It was a $725 million facility that allows us to get some loan to cost on earlier stage projects that are not yet ready for the securitization. In those cases, we can get, depending on the state that the data center is in, if it's just kind of dirt or under construction, there's a modest amount of leverage we can get. If we have a pre-lease to a certain amount of the building, we get more leverage and we can work our way up to over 50% LTC. If it's, let's say, a new data center construction where we've pre-leased greater than 50% of the property. So that's a facility that, and it's a revolving facility. So as assets mature inside that facility, we would then contribute them to the securitization, freeing up availability under that facility to bring in a new asset that is in an earlier state. In addition to that, the third leg, we have done project finance, really a construction loan. We did that with a 40 megawatt data center in Atlanta. So back to my math on cost per megawatt, it was about a $400 million build for that facility. In that case, we had pre-leased that entire facility to a single investment grade tenant and we were able to secure a construction loan at about 80% LTC to be able to finance the construction of that facility. We would then take that facility once it's fully stabilized and turned up and move that into the securitization and obviously retire the construction loan. Thank you for that. Good insight. Okay. Let's revisit. And I think maybe it's something you and I even talked about before briefly, just power constraints facing the industry. Might as well check back in on this issue. Just what are you seeing? How's the broader data center industry navigating those power constraints here in the US and anywhere else you may have seen? What's worked? What's not? Yeah. Let's set the stage for that question. It's a great question. Power is obviously the lifeblood of data centers because the equipment that goes in those data centers is what's consuming the power, the compute, the storage, the networking. It's everything that delivers the digital experience and the digital services that really society has come to rely on for day-to-day life. In the United States, and the estimates, they vary, but there's around, call it 20 gigawatts of data center capacity that's installed today inside the United States. With the advent of generative AI, those estimates say that by 2030, we're going to be at 40 or 50 gigawatts of data center capacity. Data centers consume today on a global basis around 3% of global electricity consumption. The estimates that I've seen say that by 2030, it could be as high as 6% to 9%, which again, is still a small percentage in terms of 100, but obviously, a doubling or almost a tripling of that consumption over the next 10 years. Yes, power has become one of the key constraints within data center development. The good news is that two things have happened. Number one, there was a lot of power available in the U.S. We have to recognize that there's been a lot of investment in renewables, especially in renewable generation. That stuff would get installed, obviously, in areas that renewables make sense, like in West Texas, or in the Plains, or in Arizona, and places like that. As it gets connected to the grid, that power can now be consumed by data centers. In the case of DataBank, and we made a big announcement today where we announced the third campus development, which is a 480-megawatt data center campus in South Dallas, in addition to our 120, previously announced 120-megawatt campus in Atlanta, and 192-megawatt campus in Virginia. You total those three up, and that's almost 800-megawatt of data center capacity. Certainly us, as a data center developer, we've been able to secure power in markets that people thought were going to be constrained, but that there's still pockets of power that are able to be unlocked. There's still a lot of data center development happening in what we call these core markets, the three that I just described, in places like Chicago, and even Ashburn, and Manassas, south of Ashburn, and in Hillsborough, Oregon, and Phoenix, and in Las Vegas, and Reno, Nevada. There's a lot of capacity available in those areas. That overlays completely with where data center development has occurred. Now another thing has happened, which is geographies where heretofore were not considered data center geographies are now emerging as data center geographies. A great example is, earlier this year, Amazon announced that they had secured about a gigawatt of power in eastern Pennsylvania, really in central Pennsylvania, right on the grounds of a nuclear power plant. That's a site that had been actively marketed in the data center sector before generative AI, before chat GPT, and no data center developer or data center user wanted to go to that location. It was just too remote, too difficult to get power to, too difficult to tie into the rest of your assets, too difficult to get people there to build it, and maintain it, and want to be there. There was just not a reason to go there. Because of this increase in demand, we're seeing locations like that. I've seen data center announcements in Wyoming, in North Dakota, in Mississippi. Again, these are regions that have not been considered viable data center locations, but now, with generative AI, you're starting to see that. Interesting. We'll have to check in with you again down the road on how that's working out. Let's talk about AI. A lot of CapEx pouring into the data center industry, build out that capacity to support AI and all the other data-intensive applications. Yet, over the last few months, we've seen questions starting to emerge about whether the technology will be able to generate enough revenue and profit to warrant all this buildup that's going on right now. Do you have a take on that? What do you think? Oh, yeah. I absolutely do. I've been in the Internet sector for a long time. I got in at the advent of the commercial Internet in 1995, so I've seen the evolution from dial-up to where we are today. Fundamentally, I am very bullish on technology adoption. Data centers, at the end of the day, that's what they symbolize. They are basically a vessel for technology adoption. If you believe that technology and the use of technology, and digital technology specifically, is going to increase over the decades to come, which I certainly believe that, my view is that there's a bright future for data centers. Generative AI is kind of the latest version of that kind of technology adoption. We've seen a lot of our customers begin to adopt generative AI. The other really great benefit of being a data center operator is that we have a front-row seat into technology adoption because we service over 2,500 customers across our 70 data centers. We see what technology they're bringing into our data centers, and it gives us a sense for where that adoption curve is going. My personal view is that generative AI is as transformational as kind of when the Internet came out in 1995. I remember walking around Manhattan in 1995 and convincing people they needed Internet access and being told no. Now look at where the world is today. Generative AI, very powerful technology, very difficult to control, configure, and to implement. It's going to take a little time to figure that out, but you're already starting to see the beginnings of use cases that are really being transformed by technology. Talk about two of them that we're seeing. Number one is in software development. If you think about the ability of generative AI, which are these large language models to kind of master code, to master different types of software development platforms like Java or C++ or whatever it may be, and to be able to spit out that code very quickly and then allow developers, it's almost like a first draft, to be able to tweak it and customize it, it's going to save a significant number of man years in terms of software development. If you're interested, you can kind of look at Andy Jassy recently posted on his LinkedIn feed some software development activity that Amazon has done in terms of updating their foundational code for Java. They basically said that they saved 4,500 developer years by using gen AI to update that software, using gen AI as opposed to their traditional development effort. I think in the coding area, generative AI has already found kind of a very powerful impact and it's going to spread because so much of, think about how much software is out there running the world. Then the second example that we've seen is in pharmaceuticals and in healthcare. We're seeing a number of companies begin to leverage generative AI and data to revolutionize like drug discovery, right? Drug discovery is typically a thing that happens in a wet lab, in a building where chemists and scientists are kind of playing with test tubes and liquids and things like that. People are now discovering that, hey, they can create these databases of human cells, of human DNA or RNA, and then run it through a generative AI model, a large language model, and glean new insights into drug discovery. I think it's really only a question of time before other industries figure out how to harness this technology to create competitive advantage in new products and services. I think that the world's going to look a lot different in 10 years than it does now. I agree with you on that. I believe you're right. I feel like every day when I'm flipping through headlines, you see a company investing in this AI startup or becoming a customer of whatever, given AI-enabled software. I felt like I saw a prologist announcement. I might be mistaken. Don't want to do this. But they made some kind of announcement. They're using some kind of AI application. What a time to be alive. Raul, that's going to probably take care of it for today. Listen, I really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Very enlightening stuff. Let's do it again down the road and catch up and check in on some of these issues we talked about. Sounds good. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it, Raul. Thanks for having me. All right. Have a great day. That was the one and only Raul Martinek of Data Bank. All right. I want to thank our listeners for tuning in today. Listen, don't forget to like, subscribe, and share the podcast. That's it for me this week. Don't forget to tune in next time. Until then, take care.

I'm here with Ram Orenstein, who earlier this year became Managing Director of the Ascend Energy Exchange, or AEX, the M&A advisory wing of Ascend Analytics. Ram, thank you for joining us. Pleasure to be here on Ofrio. Much, much appreciated. So congratulations on this new role, and we're looking forward to you coming over to the U.S. and getting involved into the market here. Let's start by talking about Ascend and the AEX platform. Can you briefly describe each and how they're different from one another? Sure. Absolutely. Ascend Analytics has been around since 2002 and is the leading provider of market intelligence and analytic solutions for the energy transition. We enable decision makers in power supply, procurement, investment markets to plan, operate, monetize, and manage risk for renewable energy and storage assets. From real-time operations to 30-year forecasts, we bring forecasts and insights that are the foundations of over $50 billion of project financing assessments. AEX is, or the Ascend Energy Exchange, is our M&A advisory service that utilizes an exchange platform, and it is unique in our view in the renewable and storage transaction space because it is part of the Ascend ecosystem of advanced software and consulting. And therefore, it draws on our market expertise, our trusted valuations and neutrality, as well as our extensive energy community network to bring a streamlined asset sale process that serves both buyers and sellers. Let's talk about AEX and what you're focused on in the near term. Keeping in mind that you've said it's strictly storage that you're working on now, what types of opportunities is AEX interested in? Asset sales, platforms? Can you give us an idea of typical deal size? What types of transactions should we expect to see you involved in? Yeah, absolutely. So yes, we focus on the AEX side on battery storage assets, both standalone, as well as assets that are hybrid or coupled with renewables. And the reason we focus on that segment is both because we think it's already large and it's growing, and also because Ascend brings so much value, specifically when you talk about storage, because we bring market expertise, we bring our ability to do asset valuations, and we offer the potential buyers the ability to bundle, if they choose so, the asset that they will procure with off-day contracts to mitigate merchant risk, which is a very unique value proposition. In terms of the types of deals we focus on, yes, it's assets as opposed to platforms. And it spans from we have helped sellers of smaller portfolios of as small as, say, 20 megawatts of distribution-connected assets, all the way to large portfolios of like a gigawatt of transmission-connected assets, like a portfolio we're taking to market right now of transmission-connected battery energy storage projects in ERCOT for Belltown, one of our customers. I think some of our listeners may be wondering why storage in particular. I know that Ascend, as a greater firm, works with developers in all kinds of renewables and energy transition projects. What is it about storage that is particularly opportunistic, as opposed to maybe solar or some other renewable vertical? Again, Ascend, as a company, is an expert on anything that has to do with the energy transition. And we absolutely help investors in any investment decision and portfolio management surrounding energy and energy transition, including traditional, conventional generation, as well as renewable energy. Specifically, at the Ascend Energy Exchange, which is fairly nascent at Ascend, in order to be focused, we decided to start by focusing, as I said, on energy storage, either standalone or coupled with renewables, because it's such a great resource, but also brings complexity not only in project development, but also, as you probably know, storage projects very often come with some merchant risk, meaning whoever is going to buy the storage project is going to own and operate it in an environment where it's not fully contracted with an investment-grade buyer for the long run, but it's actually either fully merchant or partially merchant with exposure to the markets, be that Kaiso in California, ERCOT in Texas, or other markets. And that's where Ascend can really shine, because we can educate buyers on all the complexities and the risk, both on the development side of the project, but also on the revenue side, and make sure that the buyers are fully aware of both risks, but the rewards and the risk, and also offer buyers a bundle of complementary products that Ascend offers, like our SmartBidder tool, which is an automatic dispatch software for energy storage that maximizes revenues, as well as another product called Insurance, which is a revenue put product that is a form of an off-take agreement that reduces some of the merchant risk and allows the buyer, the owner, to increase its debt. So this is all unique to storage and allows Ascend to bring additional value. Do you see yourself as filling a gap in the M&A market, maybe providing more traditional advisory services to developers that may not otherwise be at a point in their lifecycle to need or even be able to afford those types of services? Yes, I think so. And that's also in line with the feedback we are receiving, that selling an energy storage project is different than selling, let's say, a fully contracted solar PV asset with a long-term power purchase agreement that some buyers might compare to like a real estate investment. Energy storage is much more complicated. It's got more nuances. And I think the traditional M&A advisors, that's not their expertise. We are subject matter experts in energy storage. We understand the markets. We build nodal forecasts for every specific node so we can vet and screen and select only the assets that we think are better than average and have a higher likelihood to be attractive to buyers. And then we can also help the buyers understand the unique value of that asset as well as how to mitigate the inherent risk. And I think these are all services and attributes that are different from what a traditional advisor does. Let's change track a little bit. You're relocating to the US. I know that you lived here for a decade in the past. Could you tell me what is different about coming to this market this time around, if anything? Do you have apprehensions about working on renewable energy in the US? How are you managing the move and the expectations going forward? That's a great question. So, yeah, correct. I have been participating in the US renewable energy and energy storage industry for over 15 years. I spent most of that time in leadership positions at a company called Ormat Technologies, a publicly traded global company that is a renewable energy developer and an independent power producer. That's based in Reno, Nevada, and that's where I lived. I was later on the CEO of a smaller developer, an IPP called Sunflower Sustainable Investments that owns renewable energy and energy storage projects in Europe and the US. This time around, I'm excited to be leading AEX out of sand and to be moving again to the US because the renewable energy and the energy storage market in the US continues to grow. And I think that it will continue this way for years to come. We're still the beginning, I think, of the energy transition. As you probably know, it's hard not to notice the market share of international energy companies in the US renewable energy space, global companies that come from Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America. And I think the reason they come is because, A, the market is, the US market is so big and it's still growing. B, there's all these supportive policies. When I started 15 years ago, it was mostly the renewable portfolio standards at the state level that was incentivizing renewables. Then came the stimulus package with the loan guarantee and the production tax credit and the investment tax credit. In the last couple of years, of course, it's the Inflation Reduction Act. So while the policies change, I think the trend is very clear and I think it's a privilege to be part of that transition. You know, one of the first stories I ever wrote in this role was about foreign investment in US renewables and all the firms that were coming into the market. I think you're uniquely positioned to comment on that, given what you just said. Do you think that we've seen peak inflow of foreign firms? I'm not saying dollar amounts or anything like that, or actual size of investment, but just the number of firms, like is everyone who's interested in being in US renewables here? Or do you expect to see more firms and investors coming into the space that are not yet active in North America? Wow, that is a great question, somewhat philosophical. I think the trend of foreign companies entering the US, you know, it was clear to me when I was part of that 15 years ago, and it seems like it's not slowing down. The IRA, I think, definitely provide an extra boost of additional players. I don't see a reason right now to think that it peaked. I think what we have seen over the last decade or two is many cases of companies that started in their local market, and then that's smaller than the US by definition. And then once it exhausted that market, and they want to grow and expand, they move to the US. So I think this trend is here to stay. But as so many things in our industry, there is some cyclicality, right? Just like in what I do now, which is the M&A space. We have seen some cooling off over the last year, driven by higher interest rates that make the cost of capital for buyers higher, as well as some extra challenges for developers, the sellers, be that on supply chain or interconnection challenges. So there will be ups and downs, but I think the trend is steady and is clear. Yeah, that's a great segue into my next question about your outlook on deal flow in the US storage market, and let's call it the next 12 months. Do you expect it? Like, are we in an up moment? Are we in a down moment? Where are we heading? I'm not expecting you to be a fortune teller or predict the future. But what do you anticipate the next calendar year is going to look like? So like I said, we are currently in somewhat of a down market, even though there's still a lot of activity. And we at the AX side are still very active with multiple sellers and buyers. And I know other M&A shops are too. I think over the next 12 months, we will continue to see the phenomenon of oversupply. I think generally speaking, there is massive oversupply of projects. In all regions, like if you add up all the renewable energy and energy storage projects in the different interconnection queues across the country, it adds up to numbers that it's clear mathematically that only 10% or 20% will actually get built, 80% or 90% will not. And I think this will create an opportunity for savvy buyers to pick kind of the wheat from the chaff and also an opportunity for an M&A advisory shop like AEX to help buyers or sellers because we take all the tools that Ascend has to try and vet and pre-qualify assets that we think are unique and then take them to market and leverage the network of relationships we have with buyers and sellers to maximize the likelihood of success. So to answer your question, I think we'll continue to see this oversupply. We at AEX expect to be more diverse in the portfolios and assets that we market. Historically, most of the assets we have helped sellers sell have been in ERCOT with one portfolio in the CAISO. I think going forward, we'll probably in the next 12 to 15 months see more of that trend of us working with sellers and buyers in more markets. We also expect to continue to be active both in large transmission connected assets as well as more distributed generation. But other than that, I think, yeah, because energy storage is still on a growth trend, we expect to continue to be very busy in multiple markets. 10 or 20 percent, that's, you know, if I'm reading what you're saying, right, if I'm a buyer of projects and 10 opportunities come across my desk, that means potentially only one or two are worth investing in. And you talked about how Ascend vets those projects. I don't expect you to give away your secret sauce, but I am wondering if you can comment on what you look for in a good project or perhaps rather what indicates a bad project. Perhaps you could give some examples of things you've seen without naming names that, you know, indicate, well, this is not a good opportunity for someone who's not quite as involved in the storage market as you. What are those giveaways when you're being presented with opportunities yourself? Yeah, absolutely. And it's true that we don't have the crystal ball and we can't tell with certainty which projects are going to be winners and which are going to be losers. But we do have a set of tools that we use to the benefit of the sellers and the buyers. And that includes, first, we look at the market, like some markets we think are ripe now for energy storage, where energy storage is in the market. Texas, for example, right now, we think it's hard to go wrong because the fundamentals of load growth and the growth in renewables that's driving the need for storage is there. So we look at the market outlook, then we'll look at the specific node, which is a sense expertise. So when we look at assets, we look at the specific revenue potential at that specific node of the project. We then build financial models, the type that we know savvy buyers would do. And again, I have the benefit of, I used to be a buyer for many years and I did diligence on numerous assets and portfolios. Some we bought, some we did not. So I have the buyer mindset. And so we take all the revenue potential, we put our best assumptions on the cost of the CapEx, the capital costs of the project, as well as the operating costs. And we see what kind of returns we get. And we think we know pretty good the type of returns that buyers are looking for. So right there, a lot of the assets we look at kind of won't cross the threshold. On top of that, we layer in our experience and my personal experience with development. Again, I used to run teams that did everything from real estate, interconnection and transmission, environmental permitting, and revenue contracts. So we do some basic diligence on the projects and we interview the developers, so to speak, to make sure that they didn't overlook any fatal flaw. And last, we are in constant contact with a large pool of buyers. Many of them are Ascent customers for other products that Ascent has to offer, like valuations and project finance and market intelligence. So through our constant communication relationship with them, we think we have a pretty good understanding on what are buyers looking for right now. And when we see a portfolio that checks all the boxes that I just mentioned, for example, that Belltown portfolio that we're taking to market right now, that's when we think this is a portfolio that has a high likelihood of getting built and being attractive to buyers. For frame of reference for the listener, you've been with AEX now for just over half a year, I believe, and the platform itself is about two years old. So given that you're a relatively young firm, how have you been received so far? Could you talk about the transactions you've worked on to date, some of the learning curves you found yourself dealing with? And I'd invite you to talk about the deals that you've closed so far and what you felt was notable about those. Yes, happy to do that. So you're right, this is a fairly nascent activity and we're a small team at Ascend. So we focus much more on quality and cherry picking the assets and portfolio that we take to market versus the volumes. So from that perspective, we're not a marketplace where any seller can post and any buyer or would-be buyer can browse. It's much more of a curated exercise where we're trying to be very selective. And as such, we helped a handful of developers, names including Golden State Renewables, which is a developer, California-based developer that has assets in Texas, and we helped them successfully find buyers for portfolios of distribution-connected battery storage assets in Texas in three different transactions. So it's like a repeat customer that came three different times. And every time we were successful in finding a different buyer. We've also worked with big names like Peregrin and Clean Capital, helping them take their portfolios to market as well as smaller like EnerSmart and Belltown. So our hit rate actually so far has been close to 100% in terms of our ability to allow the sellers to connect with a quality buyer. And the feedback we are receiving is that our approach is somewhat unique because we don't treat an energy storage project as a commodity, but rather we do all that screening and vetting and do the extra effort to try to market it. We also, for example, Ascend as part of its market intelligence expertise, does multiple webinars on the markets that we cover and the products that we offer. And as such, when we take a portfolio to market through AEX, we also do a webinar with the potential buyers, which is unique, I think. So I think sellers and buyers have come to appreciate the unique approach that we are taking to selling those assets. I hope it stays like that. Yeah. Batting a thousand, given that information about your deal pipeline, what should we expect from you in 2025? You know, you've mentioned a lot about what you've done and what you're currently doing, but how much of a workload do you expect to be able to take on next year or even through the end of this year? Like I said, even though the market, like I said before, is slowing down a little bit, we're very busy right now and we expect to stay busy. We are in touch with multiple potential sellers to see if they have assets and portfolios that we think we can help them take to market, as well as with buyers. I expect the level to remain to be very busy as it is. Like I said before, we do expect to continue and diversify more markets, not just Texas and California, and also to continue and support sellers and buyers, both on large transmission-connected assets as well as distribution-connected assets. And if, as people expect, if interest rates are going to go down soon, which people expect, then probably we'll see more buyer interest and even bigger volume, which will be good for the entire industry as well as for AEX. Ram, that gets to the end of my questions for you, but do you have anything else that you would add? What should I be asking you? What should our listeners know? I think you touched upon all the important points on Ofrio. I would maybe just add another tidbit, which is we are in the process of adding another feature to our AEX platform that would make it even easier for buyers who have very specific needs. For example, if a certain buyer, and I am in touch with a few right now, has a strategy that says they're looking for very specific battery energy storage projects in this ISO, in this size range, and this range of commercial operation, and like we said before, because of the oversupply and the challenge of us finding the wheat or separating the wheat from the chaff, we're adding another feature to AEX that would make it even easier for such buyers to define what is it that they're looking for. And we will help them connect with sellers that have high quality assets that match that specific interest. So that's another kind of cool feature that we will be launching very soon. Well, I'm sure we'll all be looking out for that. I want to thank you for joining us again today, Ram. Thank you very much, Onofrio. It was my pleasure. Thank you for having me. It was excellent for this edition of Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. Thank you all for listening. Please continue to do so.

I'm Infrologic's Managing Editor for the Americas, Jonathan Carmody, and I'm delighted to be joined today by Bart White, Head of Energy Structured Finance for EMEA at Santander. Hi, Bart. Welcome to the show. Hey, thank you. Thanks for inviting me to join the podcast. Bart, one of the ideas behind this podcast was to discuss Santander's recent strong performance in our first half rankings for 2024. Perhaps you could begin by telling us a little bit about your role with Santander and some of the transactions that you look at. So I'm Bart White. I run Energy Structured Finance for EMEA at Santander. So that's our renewables financing activity across solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, but it's also everything in and around energy financing as well. So batteries, hydrogen, carbon capture, energy from waste, biogas, smart meters, et cetera. So it's quite a broad church of what we do in Energy Structured Finance. It's lending and also debt advisory. It sits adjacent to the rest of Santander's investment banking platform. So that's our M&A advisory capability and also many other products. I come from an advisory background and that's been quite formative in terms of the team strategy and helps underpin our H1 rankings that you've mentioned. Fantastic. Now in those H1 rankings, we tracked Santander across 30 deals in the renewable sector, roughly $3 billion worth of transactions, according to Infralogic, and that was slightly down on the first half of 2023 when I think Santander got about 43 transactions for the first six months of that year. So why don't we start, Bart, with just a quick overview of how you're seeing the renewables financing market globally at this time and if there's any differentiation across different continents? Yeah, absolutely. Very happy to talk about the market, of course. So I think I'll talk about the broader market and then I'll zoom in on Santander's activity during that period as well. So in terms of the broader market, I guess we'll look at supply and demand. Supply for renewables financing is down. There's the greenfield activity, so building new renewables energy platforms, new renewables energy generation. We're still seeing a decent flow of new build activity. But then it's also M&A, M&A-driven financing, asset changes hands, normally that's a point of inflection around capital structure. And the M&A activity has been relatively quiet in 2024 and of course in 2023 versus the peaks of 2021, 2022. And in part that's because of the volatility in interest rates, the bid offer and valuation still remains relatively wide. So that has reduced supply of renewables financing activity, but the demand is actually, I would say almost at an all-time high. So at the moment, my team is running over 30 advisory mandates in raising debt for renewables businesses and from banks and increasingly institutional investors, there is an amazing demand for renewables paper. So that pivot away from traditional forms of energy to new forms of energy has also resonated with bank boardrooms all the way through these different institutions. So I would say on the demand side, it's looking great. Now when we look at a reduced amount of volume, that doesn't mean that the market doesn't feel busy. I think when I speak to my peers across the market, actually everyone is very busy. And in part that's because notwithstanding the fact there's a reduction in volume and reduction in number of transactions, each transaction is actually taking a little bit longer and there's a number of factors which are driving that. So I don't think this is going to be a vintage year for renewables financing. But if we zoom in on Santander's activity, I think so there's a slight drop in the number of transactions, but overall volumes are looking very good in terms of Europe, which is my key focus in your rankings. We are 17% up from the same period the previous year, but we've also close to doubled our market share. So we're now over 12% of the European market in renewables transactions in that period. And I think what's driving that is a focus on innovative and bespoke client solutions. So that solution-driven mindset has really resonated with our clients and I think that's meant that we're doing perhaps slightly fewer transactions, but larger transactions, more meaningful transactions, delivering the solutions that clients really need. Now, Santander is definitely a global bank, but obviously you have a large business in your home country in Spain. How is Santander looking at the Spanish market these days for clean energy investing, especially considering that the government is approving 28 gigawatts of new greenfield renewables projects? So look, I am hands up a bit biased, I'm a bit of a Spainophile, but I do think it's one of the most globally relevant renewables markets and has been at the cutting edge of renewables installations for decades in terms of their position in traditional forms of renewables and now looking at new forms of renewable generation as well. So Spain, over 50% of Spain's energy use in 2023 was generated from renewables. Now there's still a way to go, but I think that's an amazing achievement. And of course, actually a lot of Spain's original renewables was in onshore wind and some hydro. And now there's been a big pivot as solar has become lower cost to these solar installations as well. And if you look at Spain, it's the second largest EU country and they've got an amazing solar resource. So I think if Spain goes from 50% to 100% of renewables energy generation, actually they'll go beyond that to become an energy exporter in the future. So very relevant market, supportive government for installing renewables. So I think anyone looking at renewables financing, anyone looking at renewables investment in general should absolutely be looking at Spain. I think in terms of outlook for Spain, there is going to be an increasing conversation around batteries. In fact, Santander did some analysis jointly with LP Delta on the use case for batteries because of Spanish solar. And actually Spain is a very relevant market for batteries. We're seeing increased number of conversations around standalone and co-located batteries in Spain. And I think that's going to be a really interesting part of the conversation for the year ahead. The other part of it, of course, is an increasing shift towards merchant and merchant projects mean we need merchant financing and Santander has been at the cutting edge of providing a large portion of merchant financing to new greenfield Spanish solar. So I think it's a really exciting market and certainly will continue to play a very important part of Santander's activity in coming years. That's a very interesting point you made about the merchant financing part. Traditionally we looked at a lot of project finance when we're talking about PPAs being of primal importance to the financing of a project. How do you see the government's support to projects considering that merchant component? Will a lot of the projects that we talked about in the 28 gigawatts rely on private PPAs? And is the market liquid enough to support that level of investment right now? So I'd never want the financing to dictate the appropriate structure of a project. I mean, sometimes bankability has to be accommodated. But ultimately, in terms of a Spanish solar project, if the sponsor wants it to be merchant, if the sponsor wants it to be underpinned by a PPA, I think there's a financing solution available for either. I think I would encourage a conversation with Santander around what is available, what financing products we can provide. There's traditional financing products and we're actually innovating new financing products for especially merchant transactions. Have the conversation, see what's available, and then make the assessment around what is best risk and reward for you as a project owner. Okay. And if we're talking about new financing, we're also talking about new technologies, aren't we? I think in terms of the development of the market that we've seen, you mentioned battery storage. That's growing exponentially here in the United States and in other regions that we're tracking as well. But what about other new technologies like carbon capture and sequestration? How are you seeing those technologies as different projects that may or may not be as financeable and bankable as other technologies right now? So look, with carbon capture, it's hard to give a generic answer on carbon capture because each project is so bespoke. But look, the headline on carbon capture is, yes, carbon capture project financing is live and kicking. We are seeing it only this year to date. We've approved over €1 billion equivalent of carbon capture financing as a bank and we're active on seven live debt advisory mandates. I do think carbon capture is eminently project financeable if the projects are bankable. And so really, the following question has to be, well, what is a bankable carbon capture project? What makes the bankability equation work? And I think first and foremost, it has to be around who the sponsor is. And what is a good bankable sponsor for carbon capture? I think it's a sponsor with track record. It's a sponsor with a fundamental engineering skillset and mentality. It's a sponsor with deep pockets because these are large, complex projects. And it's a sponsor where ideally, carbon capture is fundamental to their future. So in some way, actually, carbon capture has a strategic value. It's not just of economic value. And I think with that right sponsor, we then look at, okay, what else do we need for those projects? I mean, what's underpinning those projects of that €1 billion number I mentioned earlier? The second most important point in bankability is probably regulation and subsidy. So a framework of cash flow generation that is actually going to support the debt stack. And third is technical complexity. So ideally, these first projects, especially if they're larger projects, will follow tried and tested technology. It's interesting that you mentioned the application of more battery technology in Spain in particular. How is the financing situation for battery projects these days? Look, it's a great question. Ultimately, batteries are a little bit like mermaids. And I appreciate that for your global audience doesn't mean much. So just to say mermaid isn't universally loved and nor are battery financings. So Santander, we've done 20 battery financings in Europe, I think close to 30 globally. So for us, definitely, we are very keen to do battery financing. No two batteries are the same. I think there's a spectrum. We've got fully told batteries with very fixed generation of cash flow. And then we have fully merchant batteries, which are monetizing the spark spread. So we'll be more volatile in terms of the cash flows. But for us, the whole spectrum can be financed. And I think it's very relevant to look at battery project financing adjacent to renewables financing in general. We're also looking at adjacent technologies for energy storage, so redox flow batteries, pump storage, etc. So I think that whole segment of how to store energy is a big part of a renewable system with peaks and troughs and volatility in energy generation. Storage will continue to be the number one factor which helps deliver some of that renewables installation. And so financing it is very relevant. So a lot of technology existing today and will be developed for the future as well. And how about other technologies like green hydrogen? Is that also a sector that's right for project financing or some other kind of structured finance solutions? A lot of what we've seen is very early stage, a lot of people have been signing MOUs. And there's been a marked decrease in the stock value of a lot of listed companies here in the U.S. that are developing clean fuels. I think sometimes the market goes through moments of self-doubt, they get very excited about new technologies. But are we going to see that wave starting to crest in terms of the project finance for green hydrogen projects and green ammonia projects too? Yes, absolutely. And incontrovertibly, I think green hydrogen has a very relevant role to play in the future energy mix. It is a very important green molecule and energy carrier. So we are going to see a large use case for hydrogen in the future. And we are going to see a lot of project financing around hydrogen over the coming years. So I'm a firm believer in that. And to back that up with the team's time, we're actually working on globally 20 green hydrogen mandates on the advisory side of the business. A lot of those are around achieving subsidy and also around bankability. So it's effectively projects at an earlier stage, but we are seeing those early projects actually translate to meaningful projects of size and substance in the future. So I think that the pipeline is strong. There is always a question around how quickly does it realize, how quickly does it form an important part of our overall energy mix? And we just have to sort of wait and see. But certainly from Santander's perspective, we're keen to support clients in that early stage of their hydrogen journey. And how are you adapting the solutions that you offer at Santander Bar? Are you developing any new structured financing techniques or any other innovations in the way that you finance projects? I've heard you talk before about variable amortization. Perhaps you could describe to our listeners what that is and how that works in clean energy finance. A lot of my customers, if they hear me speaking, will have heard unfortunately about variable amortization before because it's one of my favorite topics. But I'm delighted to be able to answer that question and talk about it to your broader audience as well. Variable amortization is effectively an innovation from Santander that we've designed to help finance primarily renewables, but it actually can be applied to many other different forms of cash generating projects. Traditional form of renewables finance is a fixed annuity. So you assume that your wind, your solar, whatever it may be, generates relatively poorly in every period over its life. And then you finance that poor performance, that P90 performance over that same period. And then ultimately, the inevitable outperformance, the P50 periods, perform an outflow of equity cash flow. And what we're trying to do with variable amortization is concede that there will be peaks, we just don't know exactly when they're going to be. We monetize on a P50 basis and we variably amortize. So we amortize more when there's higher cash flow generation, we amortize less when there's lower cash flow generation. And we have safeguards for lenders and for equity to make sure that if we really do overperform on a sustained basis or underperform on a sustained basis, we can protect the equity or the lenders respectively. So it's a new form of financing, it's relatively complicated, the devil's in the detail, but the headlines are P50 debt sizing, stabilized equity dividend and lower probability of default. So if anyone listening wants to know more around variable amortization, if it's relevant for their project, again, I have to encourage that they just pick up the phone and we can have a more detailed conversation. Very interesting indeed, Bart. So sitting here in New York, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great catalyst for US renewables investing that was the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This has really spurred a boom in clean energy investing, providing a lot of clarity and guidance and fiscal support to projects across all different sectors and technologies in the clean energy space. Curious from your perspective there in Europe, which European countries have or are proposing similar legislation to try and attract that kind of capital to the markets the way that the US has done? So it's funny, we speak a lot in Europe around the Inflation Reduction Act. And a lot of times when we're speaking about it, you'd almost think it was just about clean energy, where of course, it's actually far more broad reaching piece of legislation around pharmaceuticals and tax receipts and all sorts of things. But it has been a great stimulus in terms of the focus on green energy investment. And actually, I think it's swung the pendulum towards the US in terms of focus globally in renewables as well, certainly for the last couple of years. Very, very important stimulus package. What we like about the Inflation Reduction Act is it's big, it's relatively simple. But also critically, it's also long term, it's a long term commitment. And that has given a lot of confidence for people to invest in projects. And it's that sort of legislation that is going to be successful in Europe. To answer your question, when we focus on Europe, now Europe is not one country, it's not like the US, clearly, it is a more complicated fabric. And so actually, rather than answering a question of what is available across all forms of renewables across Europe, which would take many, many, many podcasts to cover, I'm just going to focus the answer on that question in terms of hydrogen. So we do have hydrogen support mechanisms, I think in the context of the EU, we've critically got the European Hydrogen Bank. Now that is a support mechanism which is designed not only to provide capital, but also to provide a framework in which to invest to crowd in other private capital. So I think that's going to be successful. We've seen the EPC-EI funding, recently 5.4 billion announced, Germany and Spain across 30 projects, again, another incentive, another green flag for investment and new projects to come. The UK also has its own CFD mechanism and support mechanism for hydrogen projects. And we're awaiting the Hartu announcement in terms of that recent auction. So I think overall, Europe has a lot available. It may be more fragmented in terms of how to access it versus a single piece of legislation, but that's because Europe is more fragmented. But certainly with the right advisors, there is a lot of support for new projects and we are going to see renewables continue to be extremely relevant, hydrogen carbon capture extremely relevant in Europe as well as the US. When we're talking about government support for renewables, we have to talk about the recent auction for the Contracts for Difference in the UK. Obviously last year, the auction didn't result in the award of any projects, especially for the offshore wind sector, which was a great disappointment, I think, to many. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said that last year's auction was a catastrophe. But you're not quite in agreement that it was that bad, are you, Bart? I think you feel that perhaps the auction worked as it was supposed to and contracts need to be aligned with the realities of the costs of these projects. Perhaps you can say a little bit more about the prospects for this auction round that just took place. So I think Ed Miliband's comments on it being a catastrophe is interesting. I think it depends on which lens you apply to the outcome. So I mean, in terms of Ed Miliband in general, actually, I would focus more on the comments he's making around Great British Energy, which of course, very optimistic, the devil will be in the detail when we see more in terms of what Great British Energy is going to be doing. But in terms of those comments on the auction, the auction framework is of course designed to incentivize green investment, but also to make sure that they maintain value for money for the UK taxpayer. Now the auction cap in the AR5 where there wasn't any offshore wind was at £44 per megawatt hour, which ultimately proved to be too low. And in auction round six, that has been increased to £73 per megawatt hour. And so we should expect to see a slightly better, more favourable outcome in terms of offshore wind. I think the real question for the future though, has to be, what is offshore wind? Is it just another form of renewable generation in the UK, or because of the UK's track record in offshore wind, actually is there broader industrial incentive, industrial benefits for the UK being a sustained leader in offshore wind development? And if that's the case, then I think offshore wind absolutely needs its own bucket, its own subsidy framework to make sure that we continue to invest and continue to build new offshore wind. Santander continues to advise a number of clients in offshore wind in the UK, including advising on auction round six. And we are optimistic in terms of what the future will bring. Hopefully that comes to fruition and we see a lot more offshore wind built in the UK. When we're talking about offshore wind, it's not all the same thing, is it? Because obviously there's fixed base offshore wind and floating offshore wind, which is a relatively new innovation, slightly less mature perhaps than fixed based turbines. How far are we from seeing deals for large scale floating projects, Bart? And as a bank, is Santander ready for that technology? So we're already having live conversations, live advisory conversations on new materially sized floating offshore wind. And Santander has banked a couple of slightly smaller floating offshore wind projects already. And of course, it will be very relevant. So a large portion, I mean, fixed bottom offshore wind is of course cheaper. Floating offshore wind is more expensive currently. But there's a lot more potential resource, a lot more seabed for floating offshore wind because it caters for deeper seabed. And some countries, like if you look at the Iberian Peninsula, will very heavily rely on floating technology for its offshore wind market because it has very high sea depth. So I think, look, it will come in scale, it will come in size. The concern is around technology risk. But I think something which makes us optimistic as a house is that a lot of the technology applied in floating offshore wind turbines has existed in a previous guise in oil and gas industry for five plus decades. So the floating technology has been around and it has been precedented and does work. Now, I have a background in Latin American project finance and investing during my time here at Infralogic. You mentioned that you're also responsible for some areas of Latin America. Could you just give us a brief overview of how the markets over there are looking? Obviously, there's been a change of government in Mexico and a lot of investors that we've been speaking to are very enthusiastic about the possibility of a return to clean energy investing policies from the new government. But other regions like Chile, other countries like Chile have recently confused investors, slightly startled investors by saying that they were looking to change some of the small and medium means of generation tariffs that they've been using previously to attract great amounts of investment to the smaller scale of the renewables developers. How do you see the markets in Latin America and the policies that are in place to encourage investment in those countries? So look, what I would say around Latin America, because there's so much to cover and we won't have time in the context of this podcast, but certainly happy to come back for another session to do a deeper dive. I think in the context of Latin America, actually, sometimes people say, well, they're behind, but that's really not true. If you look at a country like Brazil, actually over 90% of Brazil's energy generation comes from renewable sources. So actually a lot of Latin America is really leading the way in terms of renewable energy and will become a very meaningful energy exporter as a continent in the future. And so I think what we need to do is think around what can we do globally in terms of frameworks of certification to allow green energy, green molecules to be exported, which will then further provide a stimulus, both economic and of course, in just building out new renewables in LATAM. So very relevant geography, clearly big geography for Santander, and we do see a lot of activity and actually the pipeline for 2025, I think is going to bring a record year. And with that in mind, we can wrap it up with a bit about your outlook for 2025 and the coming years. Bart, how do you think the market is going to change in the year ahead? Is there anything on the horizon that you think our readers and our listeners would be interested in hearing about? So I think in terms of outlook, firstly, a big uptick in M&A. So 2025 will bring, I believe, one of the record years in energy M&A activity. So a lot of the activity which we haven't seen over 2023 and 2024, I think will come back in 2025. Santander is going to be at the forefront of that. We've actually been hiring hundreds of incremental bankers to continue to grow our M&A capability. I think it's really second to none at the moment. So a lot of focus on M&A and of course, that will drive a huge tangential energy financing activity as well. Then in terms of what we're seeing, we're clearly beyond an election cycle as we go into 2025. Now, I'm not a political expert, I'm just an energy financing expert, so I'll spare the listener my sort of amateur views on politics. But what I would say is renewables financing, renewables in general, is about jobs, it's about energy security, it's also about low-cost energy. So I think in general, the outlook for renewables, whatever the political persuasion, whatever the outcome in any election, is going to be a lot of focus from governments and from people in general and industry in building out renewables. So overall, I'm a huge optimist about the year ahead and also the years ahead. Excellent. Well, I'm sure we'll have many more opportunities to discuss the renewable financing market as the clock ticks. Bart, thank you very much for coming on Crossroads. We appreciated your insight today. Jonathan, thank you so much. It's been great to talk to you. And thank you to all our listeners. As always, you can find Crossroads anywhere where you get your podcasts and we look forward to having you on our next episode.

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior reporter for InfraLogic, and today I'm joined by Alan Marks, a partner with Milbank's Global Project Energy and Infrastructure Group. As our listeners have no doubt heard, it's an election year in the United States, and the two major parties could not be further apart in their policy objectives for renewable energy. Alan is one of the experts we spoke to at InfraLogic for our look at how investors and project sponsors in the renewable space are managing the political uncertainty surrounding the election. I encourage everyone to check that story out at IonAnalytics.com, but as has become an evergreen statement in American politics, a lot has happened in the few short weeks since that story ran. So there's plenty of new ground for us to cover. Alan, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast. Thank you, Chuck. It's a real pleasure. Well, first of all, I wonder if you could briefly introduce yourself for those who haven't heard you on the podcast before, and tell those listeners who aren't familiar with you about the work you do with Milbank. Sure. I'm a partner at Milbank and have been working in renewable energy and other infrastructure for over 30 years. My clients include project developers and sponsors, private equity funds and infrastructure funds investing in either new or operating assets, as well as other parties to some of these transactions. And as listeners who are familiar with your previous appearances on the podcast or have read your great analysis that you write for Milbank, your depth of knowledge in the space is unparalleled. So we're really lucky to have you on the show today. Well, thanks very much. Oh, absolutely. When we spoke for our InfoLogic story on the election, you said that investors in the renewable energy sector have become less sanguine about the potential impacts on the sector from the elections in November. Could you tell me a little bit about how investor attitudes have changed in recent months with regard to the elections? Sure. Happy to. So investor attitudes have to be viewed as in a context. Most people in an election year don't focus too closely on the policy outcomes of the election or significant economic changes until the election is closer. And investors are no different than anyone else in that regard. I think with respect to investors, a lot of the increasing focus you'll see being brought to the potential different outcomes of the election relate to first significant policy differences, especially in areas of energy and climate between the two candidates. The Republicans have nominated Donald Trump, of course, and it looks that Kamala Harris will become the Democratic nominee at their upcoming convention. And the parties certainly have different policies on that. I think we're also in the context of coming through a period of the last three or four years with significant uncertainty about the economy, which is doing much better than most people would have expected, and also about geopolitics and some of the other broader risks that do impact both international investment into the United States, especially in the energy sector, and also energy as an asset class globally. So as people focus coming into the election on an outcome which is uncertain and binary, that can have dramatic effects on their investments, either pro or con, depending on the types of investments they're doing, that's going to get renewed attention. If this was an election which was not close, if this is an election that had parties or candidates that were more similar in their policies, and if we had not gone through the uncertainty of foreign wars and COVID pandemics and the recovery from it, and a lot of those things, then I think we'd be in a different situation. And I mean, obviously, the major legislative support for the renewables sector during the Biden administration has come from the Inflation Reduction Act and the many renewable energy incentives included in that legislation. Throughout our reporting on the election and investor attitudes towards it, we've heard over and over again that the core incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to remain intact regardless of the election outcome. As you indicated during your remarks, it's been an extremely volatile few weeks in American politics. Are industry experts still confident that those core provisions are insulated from major changes or rollbacks in the event of a big GOP win in November? It's certainly the case that if the Democratic candidate is elected, if Kamala Harris becomes president, or if the Democrats are able to take control of the House or retain control of the Senate, which may depend in large part on how the White House goes, that you will see not just a preservation of renewable energy incentives and other provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, but probably an expansion of policies that are meant to foster growth of renewable energy and other climate-friendly investments, including EVs and so forth. If the Republicans were to win the White House, especially if they were to control the White House and both chambers of Congress, I do think we'd see significant changes in policy. Now, that does not necessarily mean that the Inflation Reduction Act gets repealed. I don't think there are enough votes in even a Republican-controlled Senate to do that despite what the House might do or what the White House might like. There's a lot of reasons for that. For one thing, the benefits of investments that have been spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act do accrue to both red states and blue states. If you actually dig down more deeply, the majority of the investments in clean energy facilities have come in counties or districts that are Republican or Republican-leaning. Almost two out of every three jobs that have been created have been in Republican counties or districts. In the end, the investments in clean energy manufacturing facilities, there's some in New York, there's some in California, but there's quite a bit in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio, and others that tend to lean Republican. A lot of members of Congress have a vested interest in the provisions of the law that are promoting growth and job creation in their states or their districts continuing. Having said that, I think there's also clearly in the Republican platform in Project 2025, which is from the Heritage Foundation, but associated with many of the people that either were in the last Trump administration or are likely to be in the next one if he's elected, quite a number of provisions that would seek to roll back the capacity of the federal government to encourage or mandate decarbonization writ large. How would government agencies be staffed? Which agencies would continue? How would tax guidance and other regulations that come out of the broad range of federal agencies that can impact that investment, how would those play out? So even if you have, imagine every provision of the Inflation Reduction Act stays intact, there's still a large question mark, I think, over how the government would function, what the government's policies would be from a regulatory side and from an enforcement side, and you would have to see how that plays out. And among the big changes in the political landscape in the past few weeks has been both the announcement of J.D. Vance as the vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump and the emergence of Kamala Harris, as I think it's safe to say that she is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president now that Joe Biden has announced he will no longer run for the nomination. Do either of these developments significantly change the outlook for energy policy outcomes from the election? I don't think so. I mean, Kamala Harris, let's start there. I think she would be expected to continue the policies that the Biden-Harris administration has already had with respect to being in favor of renewable energy, generally speaking, exposed to expanding drilling for oil and gas on federal lands and supportive of newer technologies like green hydrogen. The administration has also supported blue hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, both in the hydrogen hub proposals that have been approved and funded or approved for funding from the federal government and in some other policies. The Inflation Reduction Act, of course, has significant incentives for CCS and for hydrogen in several colors. I think I would expect those policies to continue. I think the export limitations on LNG or more precisely the Biden administration's suspension of approvals for new export permits for new LNG facilities, I suspect that that might not continue after the election, regardless of who's elected, in part because of regulatory requirements and in part because of the demands for natural gas in Europe, especially imports from the United States, which has a pretty big geopolitical significance and stabilizing or continuing a more stable supply of energy in Europe. It has big international geopolitical consequences. And I think you would see a President Harris or a Harris administration also continue U.S. involvement in global climate talks and the mechanism and framework underneath the Paris Agreement. In contrast, if there was another Trump administration, I suspect you would see an attempt to roll back support for electronic vehicles and the national government's role in EV charging. I think you'd see a big push for expansion of new exploration and development of fossil fuel assets, oil and gas, both on federal lands and in the continental shelf. I suspect you would see an attempt to roll back some of the greenhouse gas emissions limitations, which have either been adopted or proposed by the EPA, even though those rules have largely been upheld most recently by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and at least implicitly, occasionally even explicitly since the Massachusetts decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. You know, it's interesting, too, if you look at judicial appointments and what that could mean for how courts interpret federal authority, there's some question as to whether agencies could have a dramatic 180 regulatory pivot, for example, in finding with respect to the harm of greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts and how relevant that is or not to the EPA's regulatory authority. In some ways, the courts have made it more difficult in recent decisions for agencies to have kind of unfettered discretion in changing their determinations. So that could make it ironically harder for a Trump administration to make significant changes on that score. I think that there is in the current Supreme Court and certainly in a more conservative circuits like the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, a lot of concern about regulatory overreach when it comes to regulations that have a significant impact or a major question for the economy that an agency is exceeding what Congress would have delegated to it as far as statutory authority. Right. And I think to your point, it's fairly easy to imagine if, say, a GOP staffed EPA or FERC decides to volunteer that they don't have the authority to regulate certain aspects of the climate or the energy sector. I can imagine the court appointments coming from the Trump administration to be more sympathetic to that sort of regulatory logic than a more forceful effort to impose federal regulations from the executive branch on carbon emissions. That's right. If you just look at greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 and other greenhouse gases, you know, the Massachusetts EPA case basically determined that the EPA has both the authority and the duty to regulate those emissions. If you flash forward to the West Virginia versus EPA case, which more significantly reined in what the EPA can do in particular looking at cross-state emissions policies, the court left intact the interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the EPA should be regulating greenhouse gas emissions. And if you look at the most recent ruling out of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, it's pretty clear that if the EPA does that in a direct way, the same way that it regulates other pollutants from stationary sources, that's well within the EPA's authority. If the EPA were suddenly to decide that it chooses not to regulate air pollution, that would violate the intent of Congress as expressed in the Clean Air Act and other laws. And I think there could be some judicial pushback to that, even from a conservative court. Absolutely. And drilling down a bit deeper, it sounds like the political risk exposure isn't uniform across the renewable space. Are there corners of the renewable energy sector that have more to gain or to lose from this election? Yeah, I think so. If you look at winners, I think onshore wind, I think solar and energy storage, maybe even electric transmission, all of those probably will have enough, if you will, critical mass and momentum from both economic drivers from state regulatory policies and from technological improvements that those might continue regardless. If you look at other areas that are especially meant to be stimulated by Biden-Harris policies and by laws passed in the last four years, and here I would include not just the Inflation Reduction Act, but also the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I think the CHIPS Act, because that certainly is a big part of the broader industrial policy theme of having the federal government incentivize or subsidize often through tax breaks, certain types of investment. If you look at those types of things and compare with the possibility of what might change in election outcome, I think, again, if Harris is elected to succeed Biden, then you'll see kind of more of the same and continuity and stability in federal policy. If Trump is elected, you'll probably see a greater push to support oil and gas, potentially, maybe even coal, although coal is today only about 20% of US power generation as a resource and is for economic reasons and other non-climate environmental reasons, less favored than it has been in the past. I think areas like green hydrogen, where the federal government has provided initiatives through the hydrogen hubs, which are part of the laws and the package approved by Congress, that may have some headwinds. Anything depending on the federal loan guarantees, especially for more innovative clean energy technologies, may be impacted. And if you look at how energy is used, because it's not just a question of how energy is generated, we can't look at that in isolation. That's where I think you might see some other changes. Right now, if you look at projections of growth in GDP generally, but also in energy in particular, in the United States, we have a significant growth right now in demand for electricity. Now, what's driving that? Some of that is AI-driven investment in data centers and digitization of other parts of the economy. So that, I think, will continue regardless of who's occupying the White House. If you look at electrification and mobility, that's where you see some really big differences. Right now, the transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. And one of the harder-to-abate sectors, if you don't have a shift to EVs or potentially hydrogen fuel cells or other technologies, not just for cars, but also for heavy-duty vehicles and for trucks and for freight, and potentially including electrification of rail, sustainable aviation fuels for jet aircraft, especially cargo-based marine traffic. So that's an area where you have, I think, a bigger challenge and a bigger opportunity for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and that's one where the two candidates really would have different policies. For EVs in particular, it doesn't do you a lot of good if you plug in your EV to electric grid that's not also being decarbonized. That may increase costs. It certainly increases exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices, and it certainly does not alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. So that interplay between energy generation, energy use and changes in load or demand, and other sectors, whether that's transportation or agriculture or buildings or hard-to-abate industrial heat, how those things all fit together kind of require a holistic approach and not just looking at these things in silos and certainly not just looking at it as a preferred energy source or preferred sector of the energy market in which to invest. So that whole of government thinking and that holistic approach that tries to improve the quality of digital communications, improve the quality of transportation and transportation networks, while at the same time making the energy sector more efficient and potentially cleaner. I think how those things come together really depends a lot on the approach. And if you have a government which doesn't take that type of a holistic approach, then you're likelier to get either uneven investment or inefficient investment and capital allocation or kind of a lot of unpredictability in potential policies, which could chill investment. And I know we invited you on to talk about election-specific matters, but we did recently get pretty big piece of news out of Congress. Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso recently introduced long-awaited legislation aimed at streamlining the permitting process for major infrastructure projects, including energy and transmission. There's not a lot of time left between now and the end of the year. And that's before you take into account the amount of energy that's going to be dedicated to the presidential and congressional campaigns. Is there much in the way of possibility for this legislation to move forward during the current session? No, I don't think so. I mean, look, we've had permitting legislation introduced before most recently, in fact, with the support of some of the same people supporting this bill, including Senator Manchin and with the support of the White House, as announced by President Biden, even though they didn't agree with all of the things in the prior permitting legislation. The one that's come out now most recently is, it's labeled a bipartisan permitting bill. I'm not sure that that's really an accurate label. Senator Manchin, some of the Republican senators that are in support of it, have included in it many things that both parties like. They've also included in it provisions that I think are kind of dead in arrival in the Senate this year, which is still controlled by Democrats. So to be specific, if you look back to the bipartisan infrastructure bill, there were proposals made, which were adopted by Congress and are now already being implemented by the administration, FAST-41 in particular, that were meant to streamline federal permitting. They didn't really go far enough. But some of those things included a single federal dashboard for permits and approvals, better interagency coordination, kind of processing permits in parallel instead of just serially, shortening the statute of limitations for certain types of major federal projects that were subject to NEPA and other laws, and where there was transparency in the permitting on the federal dashboard, and shorting that statute of limitations from six years, which is the general statute of limitations that is subject for a lot of these government actions down to two years. So that was a lot of progress. And for big projects, say over $200 million, that was a lot of help. What we did not see was clear federal preemption in order to facilitate interstate or regional electric transmission, which I think is one of the major things that has to be done to make our energy sector more reliable and more efficient, and also to facilitate the increase in renewable energy sources that are remote from load centers, and to allow those transfers of power from places where it's being generated, especially by intermittent resources, into areas where the load is growing. And some of that is urban areas, for example, where you have growth in manufacturing and you have a lot of people that need to turn on the air conditioning in the afternoon, but some of it is also in places that are remote. Data centers come to mind in some of the manufacturing that's being built in ex-urban or rural areas. So I think both parties would support the provisions of, as they did in the prior iterations of this permitting reform, I think they would support what's in the Manchin-Brasso Bill on streamlining permitting at the federal level for interstate and regional transmission. Similarly, I think there's other provisions in it that would be favorable for renewable energy that, frankly, both parties, at least historically, have supported. In contrast, though, there's other provisions in the bill that would greatly increase and sort of mandate by congressional action more leasing for oil and gas on federal lands. It would require the federal government to have at least annual auctions for offshore energy, both for offshore wind and for offshore oil and gas. And that's what, if you pause on that for a minute, it kind of tells you why there's some things that are almost like poison pills in the particular permitting legislation. Historically, before a couple of years ago, if the federal government under the Outer Continental Shelf Act wanted to lease areas for oil and gas, it could do so, and it did. There were regular procedures to go through for that. Most of the lease areas were either not bid on or if they were bid on, they were not developed because functionally, there's a lot of other macroeconomic concerns as to whether it's justified to, if you're an oil company or a gas company, to actually develop all those reserves, but you have the right to do so. And similarly, if there was investment in offshore wind, that was done under regular auctions that the Bureau of Offshore Energy Management would undertake. And there have been successful auctions on the U.S. east coast and the northeast, and projects are now either newly in operation or about to start construction or in various stages of development, especially in New York and in Massachusetts. We're seeing that further down the Atlantic coast. They've had successful auctions in California, although those projects are further out in their development. And there are prospects for offshore wind, just as there has been historically for oil and gas development significantly in the Gulf of Mexico. Every time the government gives a lease for energy, whether that's fossil fuels or wind or anything else, onshore solar, for example, on BLM lands, Bureau of Land Management, onshore federal lands, those developments are subject to environmental approvals. And one of the things that the new Manchin legislation would do, Manchin-Barroso permitting bill would do, is to mandate that those lease auctions be held, the leases be granted, and sort of push them through irrespective of some of the other concerns that might otherwise dictate how the government, especially the Bureau of Land Management, decides which areas should be leased. So if there are sensitive habitats, if there are areas where there are endangered species, if there are areas where there may be native or archeological sites, most of those concerns would kind of get swept away and without any transparency, really. Also in the new proposed bill, there's a further reduction of the statute of limitations down to 150 days from federal action, which is really short, not clear when that would start. It would apply to projects that are subject not just to environmental impact statements, which is current law, but also to environmental assessments, which is a much lower standard. And a project could get approved and pushed through and 150 days could go by and no one would even know. So that arguably undercuts the idea of transparency and participation in the process. There are a lot of provisions in the bill that I just cannot see the Democrats supporting. I suspect there are some Republicans that also might not support it. So calling it a bipartisan permitting reform is a little bit optimistic. So not something that we're likely to see, just a bipartisan consensus rally around trying to get this thing across the finish line either this year or even possibly in the next session. Well, let's make a distinction between this year and the next session. I think this year, look, it's an election year. It's highly unlikely that Congress is going to do anything that's radical or dramatic or impactful in an election year, in part because neither party wants to give the other one a win, even whether they agree, and in part because they simply disagree. And in part because there's not a lot of time. We've got the August recess, people are out campaigning for the election in their home districts. They're not, you know, Washington trying to hammer out things in committee rooms to find a bipartisan consensus, at least not around things that are not viewed by them as being urgent, even if they're important. Now, after the election, we'll all know which direction things are going. And that means that a lame duck session in Congress maybe could accomplish things. In the past, it certainly has. And there will be significant impetus to get things done at year end, in part because of other things related to the debt ceiling and related to budgeting that'll become more important coming into January 2025. So knowing the outcome of the election will impact what happens or whether there's new logjams that are thrown up during the lame duck session of Congress at the end of the year. Next year, we'll have someone new in the White House by definition, whether that's President Harris or President Trump. We will have a new Congress, whichever parties are in control. And in that situation, I do think, in fact, that the prospects for federal legislation to further streamline permitting of energy projects will probably find broader support, probably even true bipartisan support, certainly around things like removing the logjams on permitting and siting for energy generation facilities, certainly around removing the logjams on interconnection and giving FERC perhaps more authority to assist the state regulators and the regional transmission organizations on how to streamline the backlog and interconnection. That's true in red states and blue states. It's true for all of the new energy projects that are going to be needed to meet the new demand that I mentioned before from transportation and from digital infrastructure and just economic growth and manufacturing growth. And I think you'll see the transmission lines in particular for interstate and regional transmission being facilitated by some kind of permitting reform in the next Congress. I just think that that's essential regardless of one's political party. So might you expect this legislation to be sort of the jumping off point from which Congress in 2025 begins to work on something that could eventually pass into legislation? Not necessarily this bill. I think there are other permitting bills that have been introduced in the past that probably are more likely jumping off points if you're trying to get a bipartisan consensus. Well, I'm sure if past is prologue, there's going to be about a million twists and turns for us to follow between now and when we hopefully have a chance to join up on the podcast again to talk about some prospective permitting legislation in 2025. Fortunately, that is all the time we have today. Alan, thank you so much for taking the time to join us on the podcast. Thank you very much, Chuck. It's my pleasure. That is all the time we have for this episode of Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. Don't forget to rate, follow, and review us on the podcast application of your choice. I'm Chuck Stanley. Until next time, thanks for listening.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-07-18 17:40:57+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Accelerating project development with Deal Rocket\n**Episode ID:** 4399\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nThis is Anofrio Castilla, senior reporter with InfraLogic. I'm here today with Raj Lal, Director of Private Equity and Venture Lead for DealRocket, an energy project accelerator and Siemens Energy Venture. Raj, thank you for being here today. Thank you, Anofrio. I appreciate the invite to the InfraLogic podcast and look forward to this conversation. Always. Always wonderful to speak to you. So first, let's dive right in. Trying to minimize jargon, can you explain to our listeners what DealRocket is, what it does, and what Siemens hopes to accomplish through it? Before I basically get into the DealRocket, I think it'd be interesting and relevant for the listeners to get a bit of a context to this platform. A bit of a personal story is I started as an oil and gas trader with BP and basically developed about 30,000 megawatts of generation with a large IPP. Then I worked with the private equity fund and then started my own independent shop. So one thing you realize, and sold the company about six years ago and then joined Siemens to develop this platform. So one of the things you realize very quickly is that issues that you have as an independent developer are very different than what you have when you're working for the large IPP. Like for example, when I used to work for IPP, you just pick up a phone and you need a $2 million line, it happened. Now with an independent developer, you basically, that's one year of your life. So what we decided when we joined Siemens Energy is to build a platform that is built specifically for the independent developers. To answer your question specifically, DealRocket is an energy transition project accelerator that works with independent developers from the very early stages of the project to all the way to commercial operations. There's a platform built by independent developers for independent developers that brings the resources of project development ecosystem, knowledge, which is congestion, less siting, equipment and capital to the independent development partner. So DealRocket has basically three platforms. One is what we call optimal siting. So what we do there, we are mapping all the 65,000 nodes in the grid to understand capacity, congestion, risk. So usually the model is developer finds a site, then does the studies to find the issues with the site and that will take two years. And then you may realize that the project is not working for some reason. So we flipped the script in the sense of saying, what's the best location for a particular investment thesis? So that saves time, decrease risk. And also if the site is there, we're tracking the risk and help the developer fail early, which is, I think, a key criteria in project development. The second part is what we call the optimal development, which is basically access to the ecosystem, especially in the current environment of long lead supply chains and inflation. We basically work with our partners to inside and outside Siemens Energy to optimize supply chains, pooling, standardization, temporary transformers to bring the solution side to the table. And lastly, and I think the most important part is we have integrated platform for capital, where we work with external capital partners to finance projects across the development lifecycle, from pre-development development to project finance. So this is an integrated approach to development for independent development partners, which decreases the risk, increases efficiency, and creates a channel for institutional capital to invest in the latest embedded projects across development lifecycle. So it's a bit long, but that's what we do. Fascinating. Thank you for that explanation. What sectors are you seeing the most near-term opportunities? I wonder, is this going to be a predominantly renewables development play, or is there room for investments in perhaps more nascent sectors like clean fuels? I'm also thinking about some of the other big things we're reading about in the news, whether it be nuclear or natural gas. Where are you going to be doing these developments and directing this capital? If you had asked me this question two years ago, then that's exactly what would have been my answer, that it's all renewables, solar, and wind. But what we feel and what we are seeing around ourselves is the world is changing very, very substantially post-COVID. What we are seeing for the last 40 years, the load growth in the U.S. has been pretty much flat to negative. And now what we are seeing nationally is 4% to 5% growth. And what's very interesting from our perspective is that we are seeing pockets within the U.S. where the load growth is 8% to 10% per annum. So we are getting situations where by 2030, expected load in certain pockets is going to be exceeding their projected integrated resource plan by 20% and 30%. And of course, everybody knows about the macro factors like EV data and reshoring, which is causing this supply side issue. I think what's changed right now is everybody, because of this excess demand coming in, the balance is shifting towards the supply side for a while, and it's become very, very significant right now. So the timing and commercialization date is basically what's bringing a huge premium. And we saw that in the recent Amazon talent data center deal that everybody's been talking about. In our opinion, it's no longer about a sector, but what can get to the operations the quickest. And that's where Deal Rocket becomes very relevant, right? Because we are looking at the grid, we are looking at all the nodes, where we can get the power in quickly. From a Siemens Energy perspective, we are seeing a tremendous turnaround, and not just in renewables, but gas beakers. Siemens Energy book of business for turbines is an all-time high with lead time increasing, right? And we have seen a revival of interest behind the meter of microgrids for data. But it's not just that the demand is increasing across the world while the grid is trying to catch up. The market is paying very significant premium for niche strategies and innovation that gets power to market quickly. So we are working with developers for things like green ammonia, hydrogen, trying to co-develop viable business models in partnerships with stakeholders. So we are working on a lot of things, but the whole idea is the value proposition which drives our investments and capital. And very often, that's the focus from that perspective. Does that hold true for a core infrastructure like transmission or data centers? We're talking about load growth, we're clearly talking about data centers. Or is this meant to strictly accelerate development of power generation? So transmission is usually a very long-lead project, so we don't get into transmission projects per se. But for data centers, yes, we are basically, because we are mapping the grid, we are looking at that. Data centers have a double level of complexity. You're not just trying to optimize the grid, you optimize the data grid on top of that. So we are working on that, and that's something we are very closely looking at. But not as yet, but very soon, we'll be looking at the data centers also. There are other parts of Siemens Energy which is looking at that more closely, not DealRocket. I'd like to ask you about co-development partnerships and some of the public materials that was put out on DealRocket. It mentioned that DealRocket and Siemens would be interested in co-development opportunities. I'm wondering about what size or scale DealRocket would take on. Would you deploy your own capital into these projects? If so, what size or scale, what stake, what equity stake would you be comfortable taking? You just explain more about how that looks and whether or not those deals are forming now. Usually, our co-development partnership are with independent developers seeking to accelerate their project development. So through our integrated approach of knowledge, equipment, capital, right? So we are usually focused on utility-scale projects, but have worked with developers that have unique approaches to specific industries or niches and markets that need scale. So most of our developers started 50 to 100 megawatt project, but accelerate to 1000 megawatt portfolios across different stages. Those are the kind of deals that we are looking at. We look at traditional PV, BAS, VIN, you know, hybrid projects. We are, as I mentioned, we're more focused on the value side of it. Scale side is pretty distinct. On the question of basically the capital side of it, what we do is work with developers from the very initial stages. So what the pre-development capital is needed, we basically put in, but depending on the project, we bring the capital in. So that size is not the criteria. If you work with developers at every level of the capital stack, debt and equity, do you have need for capital partners? Are you looking for investors on your side or is everything funded from Siemens? Right. So actually, currently, we work with the investment partners on a deal-by-deal basis. And that basically, you know, we have investment partners across the capital stack that we work with from tax equity to equity and debt and so on and so forth. But what we are doing absolutely is exploring the options of getting permanent capital, committed capital to DealRocket. That's the conversation we can talk about in a minute. But you can think of DealRocket as a knowledge platform at core to basically map the grid and understand the value proposition that exists in the grid, all overlaid with the development platform with development partners and overlaid with, and what we are doing now is overlaying that with the capital financing platform to basically finance the deals that come through this pipeline that we are developing with our partners. My understanding is that DealRocket could stand alone with Siemens Energy owning a minority stake. Can you elaborate on how that might play out? And could you also explain how ownership is structured now? Absolutely. So what we are doing is exploring basically a spin out for DealRocket platform where Siemens Energy owns a minority stake in it and basically working with investment partners for this. And the idea there is basically, you know, the amount of capital that we need for a project deal pipeline is getting to a stage where we need external committed capital to the deals. The idea is right now it's under the Siemens Energy umbrella. So it's 100% by Siemens Energy Ventures. But as it gets spun out, basically Siemens Energy owns the minority stake, the team gets spun out, and then basically the right investor or investment partner can come in to make this whole thing work. Can you elaborate a bit more on the timeline of that transaction, on what timeline? Is there, you know, a set of milestones that you plan to reach or when can we expect that to take place? Yeah, so we are looking at that within the next 12 months. From an investor perspective, the way we are looking at it, basically we have two strategies. One is what we call the equity strategy, which is for development capital, which has P-like returns. And the second is, of course, infrastructure strategies as those deals move through the development phase and get to financial growth, where larger capital is needed for, you know, for build the projects out after, you know, project capital and then get to COD. So those are the two strategies which we are having conversations with our GPLPs to explore a platform approach to integrated project investing. Does that answer the question? It does. Thank you. As far as your deal pipeline, can you give us an overview of what we might see in the near term, like the next, you know, before that happens, six to 12 months, where could we see announcements of co-developments with IPPs, excuse me, independent developers, and in what sector could we most expect those to be in? I mean, some of the larger projects in data centers, you know, we might, I would think could take longer and we would expect those announcements later. Is there anything that we can expect to hear in the next, you know, through the end of the year, let's say? Sure. Absolutely. In fact, we have a deal pipeline of about $3.5 billion right now. So we are working with, we have 120 megawatt PV, 40 megawatt BESS projects, which is basically going to NTP next quarter. So you'll be hearing something about that. Then we have about 500 megawatts of PV, about 200 megawatts of, 250 megawatts of BESS, 120 megawatt wind going in next year, that's NTPs 2025, that's coming up. And then we have a couple of microgrid projects which are coming in. So yes, absolutely. So there's a pump hydro project, which is like 27, 28 pipeline, and that is coming in the thing. And I think one thing that'll be very interesting for your listeners also is we are doing this institutional approach to decarbonization. So I think what we do there is like, for example, we approach, we are having these conversations with the state agency and everybody has a net zero goal right now. And you know, 30 by 30, 30% off by 2030. And based on that, basically the state has, you know, 30% requires 5,000 megawatts of batteries onto the grid, they have about 300 megawatts right now. So what we are doing is basically, and these agencies have $5 billion given to them by the state to basically accelerate decarbonization. So our approach is basically we scan the grid, scan the state, look at grid, look at every node in there and how was the injection capability at each location and come up with a plan where we bring, you know, look at every node with what power can go in, what congestion is, and then bring the developers capital as well as the equipment side of it to create an integrated approach towards decarbonization to accelerate this thing. We did a very similar thing with a large manufacturing global company, which has 32 facilities in here. We worked with the developer to basically help them reach their net zero goals much faster with the projects, by co-developing the projects with the developers. So those are the kinds of things that we are basically working on. And hopefully, you know, look forward to continue working on that. We've touched on this a bit, and there's been plenty of interesting sort of teasers throughout this conversation. But given the Infralogic audience, you know, which you know, this is, you know, primarily serves the investment community and the advisors, where should they look for opportunities for Deal Rocket? Everything that we've talked about now, where should the investment bankers, maybe legal advisors, anyone in corporate M&A, where should they be looking for opportunities with this project? If you're an investor across the capital stack, looking to get exposure to any part of development lifecycle of the project, we can customize the exposure to the Deal Rocket pipeline that meets your investment thesis. So you know, like, for example, we have, we are working with an entity which is looking pre-development with a certain portion of the development capital. And we have customized their exposure to basically just like those activities that they're comfortable with and they get their exits post their activities over. That's the whole idea. We are basically working with tax equity advisors, we look for M&A people, we are, you know, so debt construction, debt post construction, you know, permanent debt. So absolutely, please do get in touch and we'll be very interested in talking to you. We're also talking to GPs and LPs to explore the platform approach, as I mentioned, to the integrated project investing. So if there's interest in that side, we'll be very interested in talking to you. So please reach out. Excellent. That concludes my questions for today. I would open the floor to talk about anything else that you would like to mention, Raj. Any point you feel I'm missing? Anything that's important for listeners to know about Deal Rocket? Maybe a little bit more on your outlook for the M&A market in the coming year? Sure. So I'll also give a shout out to our, you know, our primary target market is independent developers. We are looking to de-risk and accelerate your development pipeline. So if you're a developer basically, you know, looking to, you know, expand your reach or basically looking to optimize your process and accelerate your development, please talk to us. This is a platform developed by independent developers like yourself or developers, right? And we bring all these resources to them. That's my shout out to them. And of course, from our perspective, if you're looking at independent sectors, as I mentioned earlier, I think the key criteria right now is get speed to market and speed to commercialization. So we are seeing a lot of innovation in the independent developer market where, you know, people are coming up with innovative approaches. And that's where we excel at the Deal Rocket is take your innovative edge and basically scaling, helping to scale this to do this thing, attracting capital, right, which basically aligns incentives and make things faster. Excellent. This is the Crossroads podcast. I'm Anofrio Castilla, senior reporter with InfraLogic. I've been speaking with Raj Lal, director of private equity and venture lead for Deal Rocket and Energy Project Accelerator and Siemens Energy Venture. Raj, thank you so much for joining us today. I think this is something that's ripe with opportunities for the development as well as the investment community. And I personally enjoyed speaking with you, as I always do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Anofrio.

I'm based in Chicago. Thanks for listening to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast. Today I'll be speaking with two leaders at Igneo Infrastructure Partners. Igneo invests in mid-market infrastructure companies in the renewable digital infrastructure, waste management, water utility, and transportation and logistics sectors. The team works with portfolio companies to create sustainable value with the focus on innovative, responsible investment, and proactive asset management. Hamish Lee Wilson is the head of Europe at Igneo, which is an autonomous investment team in the First Centurion Investors Group. Based in London, Hamish joined Igneo in 2008. He's overseen many successful transactions, including the purchase of the UK's largest energy from waste operator Infineum and recent divestments of 4C and a minority stake in Finnish. Michael Ryder is a partner and co-head of the Igneo team in North America. Based in New York, Michael is a member of Igneo's Global Diversified Infrastructure Fund Investment Committee, and he's been with the business since 2022. Before he joined Igneo, Michael was a senior managing director and head of Americas at Omer's infrastructure and was a senior member of its executive management committee. So guys, Igneo is active in the UK, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. You manage $18.8 billion worth of assets on behalf of more than 200 investors across the world. You've been in the news recently because of your continued expansion of US Signal, a firm you bought early last year. Whenever anyone at Infralogic is talking to folks in the market about what they're investing in, digital gets mentioned a lot. But how does digital infrastructure investment converge with renewable energy? Another hot investment topic these days. Yeah. Hi, Liam. It's Michael here and very great to be with you today and appreciate the opportunity to be on this podcast. Look, as you said, we acquired the US Signal business, which is a mid-market enterprise focused data center and fiber business based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, last February, so February of 2023. We've now owned the business for coming up on 18 months, and we're incredibly happy with the performance of the business. We've got a fantastic team in place there, led by a CEO who came in when we bought the business, Dan Watts. To your point on the interplay between data centers and the digital space and renewable energy, it really is becoming incredibly important. At US Signal, we have put in place a program to ensure that all of our Michigan-based data centers, which we own, will be 100% renewable generation sourced by the end of 2026. We're very focused on moving towards an increased sourcing of power from renewable sources. On top of that, as we look across the broader portfolio of data centers that we have, and we've just recently announced an acquisition of another six data centers, we're looking to increase the percentage of renewable energy sourcing that we're using to power the data centers. On a broader basis, though, if you look beyond our asset, we see extraordinary growth in data center demand and digital demand across the next five years. Just to put some of that context in words, I think there's 15 to 20 gigawatts of data center capacity in North America today that's been built over 20 years. We expect that to double in the next three to five years. It's the amount of incremental capacity that's going to be brought online to support, amongst other things, the AI revolution that we all read about. A total cost to bring on an incremental 15 to 20 gigawatts is likely to be in the order of $50 billion, so this is a huge investment program. Power supply is becoming one of the biggest impediments to development. It really is becoming a huge challenge, particularly at the hyperscale end of the market. US Signal is more tier two, tier three city co-location data centers, so most of the data centers are sub-five megawatts, but when you're getting up to large hyperscale, multi-hundred megawatt facilities, obviously the power demand is pretty extraordinary. Figuring out the implications for the electric supply grid, how to interconnect those data centers into supply, thinking through how to develop, in some cases, actually local, new local generation sources, both renewable and in some cases relying on the existing grid are really key components of developing data centers today. We see the opportunity to not only grow our data center footprint at US Signal, but also through our other renewable generation businesses, TerraGen, which is utility scale generation, and Saltage, which is developing smaller distributor generation facilities, renewable facilities, to actually service data center developers. We see a lot of opportunity on both the renewable side and on the data center development side, and bringing those two skills and expertise together is a key focus of ours right now. Hamish, anything you'd add from a European perspective? Yeah, from our side of the pond, our slant is in Europe. We don't own any data centers yet within our portfolio. It looks at some, we've not found the right situation, but on the renewables, on the electricity generation side, that's where we're spending a lot of time, either talking directly with data center owners or developers around PPAs and long-term off-take contracts, and actually building generation to suit. So it's specifically for a data center campus. So we're having a discussion around the situation in Portugal at the moment. But then also not just the traditional renewables portfolio. So in the UK, we've got a business called Infinium, which is one of the largest energy from waste operators. So basically anything that cannot be recycled, there are two options. You can either bury it in the ground or you can extract all the energy you can from it with an energy from waste plant. And it's that business that already generates hundreds of megawatts of electricity a year. And we're in discussions with a number of developers about co-developing data center sites alongside our EFW plants. So your portfolio companies are able to help you with co-location of energy at data center sites. What other capabilities can Igneo bring to help you signal with the energy transition? So Liam, a good example of that. So our CEO at Soltage, which is our distributor generation business based here in New Jersey, is actually in dialogue with the team at U.S. Signal about how we may be able to bring co-location development of renewable generation sources, likely solar plus storage sources, to some of our existing data centers at U.S. Signal. And then in addition to that, we are having early conversations about potentially developing new data centers in locations where Soltage may develop solar plus battery storage facilities as well. So that would most likely need to be in the form of a data center that's connected to the grid. They use potentially the same interconnection for a solar facility with the data center as well, because solar plus battery storage likely won't be able to provide 24-7 N plus one or N plus two power. But nonetheless, it can provide a significant portion of the power demand for the data center and then be supported by grid power for the remaining balance. So that's a good example of where we're actually bringing two separate portfolio companies together to meet a demand and potentially build further value for our clients in our portfolio by leveraging the expertise across both of those portfolio companies. One other example, we're actually having a, I'm not quite sure what to call it, but we're bringing together some board members. We have some other experts in the industry in later this month for a full day session, including some developers from our Terragem business to look at how we might be able to develop a utility scale, renewable generation power for others who are building or running large hyperscale data centers. So those discussions are very active. We've got seven or eight people coming in to meet with senior members of our team and going to spend the better part of a day focused on that, identifying new opportunities for investment and also how we might be able to continue to advance the thinking around the best way to be providing reliable, renewable, clean power for hyperscale data centers. So you can get U.S. signal to say, well, this is actually what we need and your other companies can be better able to respond to their other customers in the sector. So on our team, we have a number of experts across the different sides of this development equation. So John DeMarco, who spent a number of years earlier in his career working with a large utility scale, renewable developer knows the sector very well and knows the challenges that renewable generation development faces as you're looking to permit to site and then to obviously execute on the development of utility scale generation projects. On the other side of the challenge and the growth is Varun Sablak, who leads our investments in the digital sector. He led our investment in U.S. signal and has a breadth of knowledge and a network of people across the digital development space who are looking at U.S. signal, more the co-location and smaller scale data center development, and then more broadly across the hyperscale development space. So bringing Varun and John together with a number of external experts and our senior advisors as well, we look at these problems holistically. We seek to tackle the challenge of how can we build clean, renewable power in order to further advance the data center development projects that we may be pursuing or that third parties may be pursuing. And we're able to bring our understanding of both sides of the equation, which I think puts us in a somewhat unique position to be able to have those dialogues. So we are very, very actively looking at this space right now. Michael, what I think is interesting is the customers of those big hyperscale data centers, the Amazon, Facebook, Google, are the same guys that are buying massive amounts of renewable energy, both for the data centers and for the rest of their businesses. And I think in the future, and we're starting to see it in the European market, they're also becoming active in the carbon removal market. So paying to different CCS or carbon capture technologies to capture carbon from the atmosphere and to use that in industry. And so building relationships with those big offtakers in power, in data centers and in carbon will be really helpful for us going forward. I completely agree, Hamish. I think the one I would even add to that and an area we don't need to go into detail on this discussion, but is water as well. Increasingly, water sourcing is becoming a challenge and we're seeing it around some of the areas of the country here in the U.S. where water is limited and data center development is actually driving shortages. So one of our Australian-based businesses has been actually working with some of the hyperscale developers on water recycling as another way in which we are actually bringing solutions to a number of those big customers. That's something that I could really take a long time on a tangent, but we've got other things to discuss. But continuing on with the energy transition, I'm based in Chicago, which we like to think of ourselves as America's railroad capital, even if that's no longer the case. You own Patriot Rail, which in turn owns a number of short lines throughout the country. And you also own Scanlines, which operates a ferry line between Germany and Denmark. Scanlines commissions the world's largest battery-powered ferry. Can you tell us about whether that experience is helping to inform your transition to renewable energy for Patriot Rail? Maybe if I start on the European side of that equation. So as you say, Liam, Scanlines operates the only ferry route between Denmark going down into Germany and has done so for over 100 years. What we've carried over that time, people and goods, has been very stable. But what we've seen over the last 10, 20 years is an increasing demand from our customer base, both on the domestic – sorry, both on the car traffic and also on the freight to reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation. And so as you say, last year we made the investment decision to put €80 million into what will be the world's largest battery-powered ferry. And there's a few challenges there. One is that the ferry actually has a very short turnaround time between when it comes into dock, the people, the vehicles come off, and then it's reloaded and goes out. So that's about 20-minute turnaround time. We needed the technical complexity of adding in recharging what will be a 10-megawatt-hour battery or battery pack on board. And that's only possible in its 12-minute recharge time with some enormous transmission lines going to the quayside. And you can imagine the port at both ends, both in Denmark and Germany, it's right on the periphery of the country. This is hard to connect, and it was a big investment to run new power cables straight to the quayside. It's a big draw of power for a short period of time. But we've managed to contract with local renewables generators to ensure that we will be able to recharge that ferry using 100% renewable electricity. And so how does that translate on your short lines? Those engines are going all the time, right? They're moving freight back and forth from a port to a transport center to just always working if they want to be profitable. Yeah. Liam, it's a great question. It's a good comparison, actually. So Patriot is one of our largest investments here in North America. It's as you said, a short line railroad. It's actually the third largest short line railroad in the country. And we operate 32, 33 short line spurs across the country, really spreading from the East Coast to the West Coast. It's not a class one. So we're not running hundreds and hundreds of miles at a single time freight rail between the major cities. We're really connecting the class one railroads to their customers, often to manufacturing hubs, sometimes actually to sort of population centers, et cetera. When you think electrification, I think many people have in their mind the European model of wires running overhead above train lines. That's just not really what we've seen in the US if you remove sort of local commuter rail in the cities. Freight rail today is large diesel locomotives who are running hundreds, if not thousands of miles. As you quite rightfully said, they're not stopping to recharge. They will obviously stop and refuel at times, but they're running for many hundreds of hours without large stoppage periods. And so electrifying the US rail network has produced significant challenges. The thought of putting electric cables across the network is just cost prohibitive. And so the other option really is to approach it with batteries. And for the reasons we just talked about, for class one railroads at least, using battery locomotives is at this point at least very, very challenging. They just don't have the duration to be able to run for the better part of a full day or multiple days without significant charging needs. In addition, the amount of electricity and supplying that electricity sometimes to locations where that would be needed to recharge the batteries just isn't available or renewable or from traditional sources. So the class ones right now, at least at this point, looking at how they may over the coming decades transition to more electrification, but it's also realized that that's likely a fair long way off. On the short line side, so at Patriot Rail, we've been actually working quite hard at looking at options to be able to use battery powered locomotives, given some of our short line spurs are much shorter runs. They can be an hour run. They may in some cases even be shorter than that. And then they're unloading, they're reloading, and then they're running again. And so it lends itself more to the use of batteries. That said, there are still situations where you need to be able to supply the power. The transmission line problem that Hamish just outlined at Scanlines can be a similar problem if you've got a short line railroad in the mountains of West Virginia servicing manufacturing hubs, and there's really just not transmission capacity in that area. It really is quite site specific. And then finally as well, just the amount of power that is needed to pull very large freight trains, freight rail is significant. And so the actual cost of these battery locomotives is still very, very high. So at Patriot right now, we are looking at a program actually at our Sacramento facility to introduce the first battery locomotive on our lines. We're working on that. Hopefully in the next 12 to 24 months, we'll be able to actually bring that locomotive in. But at this point, it is very much still in testing and development phase, and we're a few years behind the status that we see over at Scanlines. Well, I've got one more topic unless Hamish, did you have more to say about this comparison? Just on the battery side, things changed so quickly. Three years ago, four years ago, the technology would not exist at a price point that would make this make sense in terms of what we're doing at Scanlines. So you really, and this is what we do across all of our portfolio companies, but continually reassess the situation about what does the market want, what is it willing to pay for, and what can we provide in terms of that technology and that investment? And the tech does seem to be moving really fast. One thing that doesn't seem to be moving fast in this United States is the difficulty the offshore wind industry is really having becoming a viable source of electricity here. Can you tell us relatively quickly how offshore wind being a live investment opportunity in Europe contrasts with the market here? If I kick off on our side of the pond here in Europe, offshore wind has been a massive investment opportunity over the last 10 years and it's viewed very much as a route to energy security and energy independence now. I think originally it was about decarbonizing and that's why the subsidies were put in place by various governments. I think UK and Germany probably led that across the European markets along with Denmark. But now it's very much viewed as a cost competitive energy generation source that onshores, even though it's offshore, forgive the pun, but it onshores energy generation and so it reduces the reliance on things like Russian gas going forward. And what we've seen across Europe is this massive build out, this original first wave of gigawatts and gigawatts of capacity and we've seen prices come down and the requirement for subsidies to make these projects work now is almost inexistent. So they are pretty much a grid parity in terms of the prices that you can earn from generating, from building these assets. And if you'd asked me three years ago whether we would look at offshore wind in Europe, I would say that the values are too high and the returns are not attractive to us. They're just not attractive enough. We'd be looking at 6%, 7% return equity IRRs for a fully contracted operational asset. As the markets moved and there have been movements in terms of power prices, but also coming out of COVID, the logistics, the supply chains, the cost of the materials going up, we've seen liquidity has really dried up in the market for those operational assets. It's dried up for new assets as well, but the opportunity that we've seen is there are far fewer people putting money into those operational offshore wind farms. And so we're in active dialogue with a number of owners at the moment about putting some capital in, about buying into something that's got a good operational track record and still another 8, 10, 12 years of contracted inflation-linked revenues coming off the back of it. So we see as the market has matured in Europe, there are points in the cycle where we see some really attractive investment opportunities. I think when you look at that development curve and the maturity, North America is probably not there yet. What do you think, Michael? Yes, Hamish, I think you sum it up well. It's extraordinary how far the European market has advanced in offshore wind development relative to the North American market. It's fair to say that we're still very much at an early stage for offshore wind here in the US and in North America. Over the past decade, there's been a handful of offshore wind block auctions, primarily in the Northeast where the continental shelf is shallow and therefore the opportunity to develop at slightly lower cost is better. And it's adjacent to the higher priced Northeast power markets where there are fewer other options in terms of decarbonization. So we've seen developments in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, I think a couple in New York. And then more recently, we've seen auctions further down the Eastern seaboard and over in California. But it's fair to say that development is still very nascent. The supply chain that you talked about just is not fully developed here in North America. The skills, the suppliers, the fleet of lift boats for construction and maintenance, component manufacturing, et cetera, is just not really here, the skilled labor pool. And as a result, a number of those early projects suffered from cost overruns. And more recently, as we've seen higher interest rates and skyrocketing project costs on the back of COVID, some of the bids that were made into auctions earlier this decade have actually proved to be uneconomic and therefore developers have pulled out or sold out of their commitments. So overall, the North American offshore wind market is still going through a relatively early teething stage, I would say. We have seen in the last six to 12 months, a few transactions occur where capital has come in at what I'd consider to be repriced return economics, reflecting incremental risk. Some of the contracts have changed to transfer more of the power price risk and some of the development cost risk in theory back onto the market, but that hasn't yet been accepted by the public utility commissions. And so it will be interesting to see how some of those renegotiations and recontractings actually play out. So on a relative basis, we have very little to show for it in terms of offshore wind capacity today, huge potential. And I would hope over the next decade or decade plus that we will see significant development off our eastern and western coasts. But at this point, it's hard to see how we, on what timescale we can ramp up to where Europe is today. It's really difficult because it's such a young industry there and you've had, as you say, higher interest rates and supply chain issues, etc. The impact of that could be terminal on the industry in North America coming at such an early stage versus coming 15 years into the development of it in Europe. Let's see. I do think one of the benefits that Europe was able to exploit, and you touched on this before in Germany and in the UK, were a number of government subsidies to get the industry off the ground and running. It's really not been an area where the federal government has been able to pass significant subsidies. So offshore wind today benefits from the production tax credits that onshore wind development benefits from, but they're actually the same credits. The cost of onshore wind and the risk of onshore wind development is significantly less, at least in this market. And so without some level of federal incentive, this remains a slow growth area, unfortunately. We'll see how it goes over the next few years. Everyone I've been talking to does say that they think that we'll eventually get there, but it is taking a while. But thanks, guys. That will wrap us up for today's edition of Crossroads, the Infrastructure Podcast. I'd like to thank Hamish Lee Wilson and Michael Ryder from IGNEO. And thanks again for listening.

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior policy reporter for InfraLogic, and today I'm joined by Greg Lampin, director of offshore wind for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, also referred to as NYSERDA. That's the agency at the helm of New York State's efforts to develop nine gigawatts or more of offshore wind energy by 2035. As a pioneering state in the development of U.S. offshore wind, New York has played host to some of the industry's early successes, including delivery of the country's first utility-scale project, which entered service in March of this year. But it has also seen its share of drama. A number of projects that contracted with the state were caught up in a wave of economic turbulence that destabilized the business case for a number of projects under development off the eastern seaboard. Some of those projects have already signed new contracts with NYSERDA, and others are expected to participate in future energy procurements. I'm excited to have Greg with me today to talk about the current state of the U.S. offshore wind sector and the strategy for New York to pursue its goals for the industry. Greg, thanks so much for joining me. Thank you, Chuck. Pleasure to be here. Well, I'm very excited to talk with you today about New York's role in the offshore wind sector. And I wonder if you could start by telling listeners a little bit about your work with NYSERDA and New York's offshore wind sector. Sure, absolutely. So NYSERDA is a public benefits corporation. So we're a non-regulatory state entity. We're working to advance energy solutions and protect the environment. We have a lot of different jurisdictions ranging from innovation in energy markets to electric transportation, energy efficiency and energy building designs, as well as procurement of the renewable energy programs and portfolios for New York State. And sort of as I alluded to at the top of the podcast, offshore wind is a new energy sector in the United States and there have been, you know, successes and setbacks along the way. I wonder if you can briefly describe some of the major challenges that have faced the offshore wind sector in New York over the past couple of years and give an overview of what the current state of the market is. Absolutely. NYSERDA is actually responsible for the procurement of renewable energy for New York State in support of the New York State Climate Act goals. We operate under orders from the Public Service Commission on how we execute on that. But what I can say on offshore wind is in this emerging market, it's important to consider both the pace and the scale of what's going on in offshore wind to think about how these changes in market dynamics have affected our portfolio. From that perspective, I think when we started working on offshore wind around 2015 or so in development of our master plan, which was ultimately released in 2018, our goal was 2,800 megawatts of offshore wind by 2030. And only a year later, that goal was raised through the Climate Act to nine gigawatts by 2035. Just to put that in context a little bit, the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant is about 2,500 megawatts. So our goal right now is almost four times the nameplate capacity of the Niagara Power Project. But in addition to, you know, an increasing goal, both New York and elsewhere in the country, we've also seen a major evolution in the machines themselves, so the turbines themselves and their size. When we were originally working on the master planning process, projects were in the 400 megawatt range. That's what was going on. They were just starting to procure projects of that size in Europe. And here in the U.S., we were thinking we were going to be procuring similarly 400 megawatt projects. But right now, we regularly receive bids for 1,200 megawatts and larger, so almost a three times larger project size than was perceived only a handful of years ago. In addition, at the time, European machines, so the turbines themselves, were about six megawatts and reached about 500 feet tall. And now we're talking about machines that are in the 18 to 20 megawatt range and reaching almost 1,000 feet from the tip of the blade to the ocean surface. We see a lot of dynamics in the market and evolution of the technology. And at the same time, we've seen a lot of changes in the economics of these projects as it relates to global economics and changes. Projects that were procured back in 2018 were well before what we think of as the inflationary period that's occurred. So we've seen a lot of inflation in prices, commodity prices, and in interest rates and related that have had negative impacts on the overall project's performance. So their ability to be built at the price that they were procured. There's a lot of pressure you can see from those market dynamics, the price of steel, the price of copper, the price of all the things that go into making these products has gone up in addition to labor. And then sort of related but not obvious to a lot of folks is the war in the Ukraine. So when we started working on offshore wind, we anticipated being able to lean on the European supply chain for a period of time to provide the products we need to build these projects. With the war in the Ukraine, the European countries have really doubled down on their renewable energy development. So they've been trying to find ways to separate themselves from Russian gas and become independent through renewable energy. And so the European markets have really driven up the consumption of a lot of the supply chain products that we needed here. So we've been facing this in the sense that at our peak, we had about 6.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy under contract or under negotiations in New York to build in the New York Bight prior to, you know, with constructions being completed prior to about 2030. So our peak, we were about 6.5. Right now, we're about 1.8 gigawatts. So we had a lot of project attrition and project cancellation primarily due to those economic impacts on the markets. And I just want to point out that these impacts are not unique to offshore wind. Really any major capital intensive industry that takes a long lead time is feeling these effects because the prices were set prior to the inflationary period. And developers were finding that they simply could not build on the prices that were procured prior to that. So in response to that, New York issued a 10-point plan, which we're really doubling down on the fact that we are going to advance our renewable energy procurements. We're going to achieve the Climate Act goals. We listed in that 10-point plan 10 different ways that we were going to support the industry and moving forward. In doing so, we've been executing on that since, rebuilding our portfolio and bringing this industry to bear, bringing the economic benefits and the energy benefits and all the other aspects to New Yorkers. You know, it's interesting the points you make about these market dynamics impacting, you know, various sectors. That's certainly something that we've heard about onshore development and as an emerging sector with, you know, huge capital requirements, long development times, the offshore wind sector obviously faces some unique challenges when they hit some sort of, you know, pricing speed bump or anything along those lines. But when policymakers in the state do talk about offshore wind, they often describe it as a really critical piece of New York's strategy to decarbonize its energy sector. I wonder if you can talk a bit about why offshore wind is seen as so important to a state like New York and what the trade-offs are compared with development of onshore resources like wind and solar. Absolutely. And some people like to think of these things in conflict with one another, but actually the terrestrial renewables are an important part of the portfolio of achieving our Climate Act goals as well. So, there are really three components to this and those components are, you know, the location of these projects is important, the ability to scale the projects is important, and resource diversity. So, starting with resource diversity, most offshore wind blows in the afternoons, evenings and overnight. That's not to say we don't have good winds during the day as well, but typically what we see is that as the solar energy generation starts to ramp down late in the day, offshore wind energy tends to ramp up. And so, there are good resources to work with each other to make sure that those renewable resources are available at the time that they're needed. So, that resource diversity is an important part of our renewable energy portfolio in New York. The other portions are, and this is really outlined in the PSC order that started the offshore wind program. So, for New York, our terrestrial program is considered, our Tier 1 program is considered as all terrestrial resources and they're in competition with one another. Offshore wind is separate from that and the primary reason for it is its location. So, an energy in New York flows generally from west to east and from north to south. And so, our load centers in New York are New York City and in Long Island. And if you're trying to site solar projects, for example, to power New York City or Long Island, it requires just much too much land mass to be able to accomplish that. However, we're blessed with a relatively shallow continental shelf out in the ocean and really good offshore wind speeds. And so, the ability to locate offshore wind energy generation with that load in New York City and Long Island is a really important aspect of this because it allows us to not have to run cables from upstate to downstate to power the downstate area. We can run that power directly from the offshore wind resource into those load centers of New York and Long Island, New York City and Long Island. And again, you know, as I was talking about a little earlier, the scale of these projects is massive. When you're talking about 1,200 megawatt projects, these are larger than most combined cycle natural gas plants and on individual projects. And so, you can really get to scale quickly with offshore wind. And again, the shallow shelf makes these projects relatively inexpensive compared to some of the areas that are in more deep water spaces, such as California and the Southern United States. Right. And having spoken to developers about this, there definitely seems to be a sense that the areas off of, you know, the Atlantic Northeast Coast are probably the best areas for development in North America, or at least in the United States. One thing that you alluded to is the role of the global supply chain in sort of the ability to get these projects completed and bring them online. Obviously, there's the impact of the war in Ukraine that's affected supply chain from Europe. There's also Biden administration priorities for sort of standing up U.S. supply chain components and manufacturing. One of the most recent setbacks we've seen for New York's offshore wind sector was related to an industry decision not to develop larger turbines that several developers were counting on in their proposals to develop new projects. What can regulators do or state agencies like NYSERDA to facilitate coordination between offshore wind developers and the rest of the supply chain to ensure that all the critical components are developing in concert? This is a challenge of starting any industry from scratch, particularly an industry of this scale. The components that we use for building offshore wind projects are massive in size and they can't be transported by trucks. They must be built quayside right out of a port. And again, we were looking at leaning on the European supply chain, but not depending on the supply chain. If you want to site a factory to build nacelles in New York, you need to make sure first that you have the folks who want to invest in that factory have enough capital to do so. In order for them to make those investments, they want certainty that the product that they produce is going to get used and that they're going to be profitable in making that product here. And so it requires two things. First, confidence that the state is dedicated to its offshore wind energy goals. And I think our 10-point plan really reflects that. And the point is that we are very dedicated to these goals because we want that investment and we want to build those products here. Secondarily, we want to make sure that the developers of that site have the offtake that they need that can sell that product. And so what we've been trying to do is to use our procurements for the offshore wind projects and leverage those procurements to build out the supply chain in New York. So to get the buyers for that product through our offshore wind procurements. And the example you point out in our third offshore wind solicitation was really tightly integrating those two. It was ensuring that the bidders who won the offshore wind solicitation, that is the solicitation to build their offshore wind projects, were making use of a product that was going to be built out of New York and it was bringing those two things together. That creates both an opportunity in that the supplier knows that they have some procurement of that product and can predict their profitability and can ensure that the investments that they make will be recouped. That's great. We're leveraging private capital to build that here, creating economic development opportunities for New York, creating jobs for New Yorkers and ensuring that we have the supply chain that we need to build our projects. But it also puts a challenge on the offshore wind energy developers that they have to use that particular product. And they usually don't make that commitment until much later in the process. So that what happened was basically that in this evolution of the size of the products that are being manufactured, General Electric made a choice that they were going to not produce the larger machine, but really stick with a somewhat smaller workhorse, as they call it, offshore wind product. And the developers were working with them. And ultimately, as it turns out, the projects that we had selected and awarded through our procurement process were not the ones that we were contracting because of this major change in our primary components associated with them. So I think our lesson here is that we need to figure out how to integrate both the supply and the demand for products to make sure that we can build those factories here in New York and recruit the benefits, including economic development and cost benefits and savings overall. But we also want to do it in such a way that allows for our offshore wind projects to move forward. A couple of months ago, we put out a request for information, basically seeking feedback from the industry as to how best to do that. We're wading through those comments now and trying to figure out to what degree should we be integrating our offshore wind procurements with our supply chain development to get the best balance between those two things. And from some of the conversations I've had with members of the industry, there seems to be a sense that as a developer, being in a position where you have to rely on a manufacturing sector that really is just in its infancy for the United States creates significant challenges building these very large developments where the construction timelines can have a big impact on the overall project cost. But it sounds to me like one thing that you're dealing with is that the uncertainty of supply from Europe is really making this sort of drive to incorporate domestic manufacturing development into the overall deployment strategy that's become a necessity. Is that right? Right now, demand is outstripping supply. So we have globally more demand for products and vessels than are available. And that results in increase in pricing. And so we are trying to figure out how do we use this to turn what I would call a challenge into an opportunity. So not having enough supply gives us an opportunity to build that supply here. And so that's what we've been seeking to do. So we want to build the manufacturing for offshore wind in New York, not just because of the economic benefits that it affords New Yorkers, not just because of the jobs and the family living wages that these things afford, but also to make sure that we have available product to build our offshore wind projects, both here and elsewhere. So it is trying to look at what are the challenges in the industry and how do we turn those challenges into opportunities to improve New York's position in the development of offshore wind. One thing that we've heard from equipment manufacturers is that there's a sense that a focus on cost from the state entities that are selecting these project proposals, that they can be a little bit overly focused on cost and that creates pressure downstream in the supply chain and kind of squeezes the equipment manufacturers. Is this something that NYSERDA considers when they're evaluating project proposals? And how does the authority balance the interests of consumers on price with the need to develop a sustainable supply chain? This is a challenge. And for a long time, there were issues with downward pressure on pricing for supply chain manufacturers. And I think what we were seeing was the effect of developers making agreements with supply chain manufacturers and then commodity prices and interest rates and all these other things coming to bear, which ultimately resulted in a lot of those manufacturers not being highly profitable. And so this is market dynamics that need to be worked on. And I think supply and demand has a role to play in this. But right now, our process for procurement of projects is predicated on the Public Service Commission's order, which obligates us to review bids at 70% price, 20% on economic benefits afforded to the state, and 10% on project viability. So that's the scoring criteria that we're operating under. And I think we have been thinking about this from, you know, one of the phrases that we use to coin for the program is, we're seeking to advance offshore wind in a way that's cost-effective and responsible. And in cost-effective and responsible, well, in advancing, it means we're going to move forward. But in cost-effective and responsible, there's always a tension, and we're trying to figure out where within that tension we should lie. And so we can do things cheaper, but less responsibly, or we can do things more responsibly and more thoughtfully with more economic benefits and more consideration of environmental implications, but it costs a little bit more money. And we're always looking for how to balance this. But the 70-20-10, again, is predicated by the Public Service Commission. And back when the developers who had contracts with New York originally had petitioned the Public Service Commission for financial relief on their projects, basically making statements about them not being profitable, they had petitioned the Public Service Commission for relief, and NYSERDA had filed comments in response to that, offering advice and insights to the commission. And one of the things we suggested is, it might be worth taking a look at that 70-20-10 and consider reevaluating it based on the changing circumstances that we have. So I think that idea is out there. I think it's not the only way that this issue with the supply chain can be addressed, but I think it's one of the components in consideration. And so I guess sort of a flip side to essentially the same question, for all of the various reasons that you've referenced here about the input costs rising for these projects, strike prices for the most recent offtake agreements in New York are about 34% higher than they were for similar projects contracted just a couple of years ago. Is there a point at which, if prices continue to rise, you would expect state authorities to rethink the role of offshore wind in meeting the state's future energy needs? I think the first thing I need to say is, a lot of people have quoted this idea that the prices have gone up by about a third. And while that's true in that our overall strike prices have increased by that much, it's important also to note that the contracts associated with these re-procured projects have also had additional responsibilities or additional commitments from those developers. In addition to those strike prices reflecting the higher interest rates that we talked about, the higher commodity prices, higher labor costs, higher product prices, partly a result of the war in the Ukraine and the demand from the European markets. It's also important to note that there are a lot of economic benefit commitments included in these new contracts that weren't in the original. This includes things like $32 million on community-focused investments for disadvantaged communities, requiring wildlife monitoring of more than $15 million to understand how offshore wind could be affecting our offshore ecosystems, almost $200 million in the purchase of U.S. iron and steel products in order to support that industry in New York and across the country, as well as a number of labor agreements and related things that increase costs, but also increase a lot of the benefits to New Yorkers. So I think that it's important to note that that increase in cost is not just the change in the market, but also the change in contracts. But the price of everything is going up. And so New York, as stated through our 10-point plan, is very committed to fulfilling our Climate Act responsibilities and have shown a lot of different ways that we've been adapting to that. I think the 10-point plan does a nice job of outlining what we'll be doing going forward, but you can see it like in our rapid solicitation in 2023 that re-procured our Empire Wind One and Sunrise Wind projects as examples of how we're trying to adapt to the changing circumstances to achieve those goals. It's also important to note that the Climate Act considered some of this in its design. While we have specific goals for things like offshore wind, so nine gigawatts by 2035, we also have technology agnostic goals, such as 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and 100 percent zero emission electricity by 2040. What comprises those components of it is really yet to be determined. So it's going to be a mix of terrestrial wind, terrestrial solar, hydro, offshore wind, but it gives us the flexibility to ensure that we're procuring the resources most appropriate for satisfying those goals, not just the specifics. But again, the nine gigawatt goal for offshore wind is the goal that's stated in the Climate Act. Climate Act also started the Climate Action Council, who expects that ultimately we're going to need more like 18 gigawatts of offshore wind in order to satisfy the Climate Act. So nine gigawatts we think of as our near-term goal. We expect to go larger than that, and we're doing everything we can to put downward pressure on prices, adapting the way we run our solicitations, supporting supply chain development, working on coordination with regional states and developing transmission projects. All of that should help reduce the cost of offshore wind going forward while also ensuring that we can achieve our goals. Well, it's definitely going to be very interesting to see all of these issues continue to play out. It's an incredibly exciting industry to follow, and I'd love to ask you about a dozen more questions, but unfortunately we are out of time for this episode. So I just want to say, Greg, thank you so much for joining us, and I hope you'll consider coming back to update us as new developments arise. Anytime. All right.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, the news editor of Energy in the Americas for Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in. For those in the renewables and energy industry, our guest today truly needs no introduction. He is the CEO and founder of Marathon Capital, an independent advisory firm focused on clean energy, Ted Brandt. Ted, thank you for joining me today. Thank you very much for having me as your guest, Andrew. Well, so I'm sure all my listeners who work in the renewable space know Marathon very well. But for those outside of the energy sector who might be listening, can you talk a little bit about your firm? Sure. We were originally founded in 1999. We are headquartered in Chicago with offices around the world. The preponderance of our business is aimed at North America, largely the United States, but we do have operations in Canada, Western Europe, as well as Asia. We think of ourselves as the largest independent investment bank in the world aimed at the clean economy. You will see us involved in asset-related M&A, corporate-related M&A, as well as various forms of capital raising, project financing, debt raising, or in the United States, tax-oriented transactions. Well, great. Thank you, Ted. You mentioned that you founded Marathon in 1999. Can you talk a little bit about your background in the sector and what led you to launch a new firm? I can only say it was a bit of luck in circumstance. I, at the time, was out of a job, my employer's choice, and was looking to get involved in the late 1990s, moving into the new millennium. The whole story was the retirement of coal plants and the replacement of coal plants with natural gas plants. I thought that was intriguing, but when we got into that market, even a little bit, what we realized is we were very late and very non-relevant. As we looked closer, what we did find was a number of small green shoots around renewables and ultimately decided to make that a niche. I'd never been a banker before. I had been very active in structured financing. I'd never really been involved in energy other than around energy efficiency, but I did know credit, tax, and accounting enough that I was able to recognize that there was a real void in the knowledge across the market. It was kind of below the radar screen of the bulge bracket Wall Street. I would just say that we did 40 deals in our first number of years before Wall Street really woke up to the importance of renewables. Well, that's interesting, Ted. I actually never knew that, that you found in Marathon not coming from an energy background. That's very interesting. You've had remarkable success in the two and a half decades since. You've really accomplished everything you can in the renewable space except for one thing, which was being a guest on the Crossroads podcast, and I'm glad you have the chance to check that off your list today. Well, it's true. It was on my bucket list, Andrew. Ted, as you mentioned, you do a lot of work in the renewables M&A space, and it's been a two to three year period of a lot of ups and downs, a lot of turmoil. Looking at it today, what is the overall state of the renewables market, especially with a focus on M&A activity? To answer that question, probably the best answer is to take a little bit of a historical view that forever, when you thought about electrical generation, electrical generation was largely thought about the preponderance of it was baseload, and there was effectively a dance going on between nuclear, natural gas generation, and coal, and then really the last 10 years has really been the story about intermittent renewables. I know geothermals baseload, but it's a very, very small percentage, but onshore wind, offshore wind, and various forms of solar that are all intermittent forms of electricity. I do think that the last couple of years you'd have to think about as having been difficult because interest rates and the cost of capital has increased literally double from where it was in 2021 to 2023. Capital cost also went up, the cost to actually build these projects, including the EPC and all the various different panels and or turbines have gone up 25%, 30% from where they were. There's been a lot of turmoil across the industry in terms of levelized cost of energy effectively doubling because of those two factors, but I would say that in 2024, we've seen a much more constructive market. We're seeing an awful lot of deals being done. We're seeing a lot of capital in the market. We're seeing a lot of inventory in the market, and while I wouldn't call it anything close to a bull market a la the way it was in 2020 or 2021, it's 50%, 60% better than what it was in late 22 and 23. The market seems to have normalized. People seem to understand where the costs are and lots of scale is being financed. What would you say the major constraints or headwinds are right now that are still facing the renewables industry? I actually would just answer your question with one additional thing and start to talk about what are the tailwinds. Demand for electricity as projected out five years ago or five years from now, and I'm largely thinking about the US, is unprecedented. The International Energy Agency in December of 23 reforecasted their next five-year projections and projected a 5.5% compounded growth rate for the next five years. In my entire 25 years in business, what I always thought of is that demand in electricity growth grew about 50% of GDP real growth, and now all of a sudden, that's going to be two or three times GDP growth. It's unprecedented. Certainly in my business career, we've never really seen anything like it. The good news is demand is going to be incredible. I would say the headwinds are really continued cost pressures. Obviously, a lot of the solar business operates on imported product in from some countries where we have tariffs, etc., largely China and China related. There's a lot of complexity across the market, and obviously, we have an election year in the United States, and the events from the debate of last week have an awful lot of people questioning whether or not the key Biden policy, the IRA, is going to remain in place, or if not, will there be changes? I would say, while short run and medium run, things are very, very positive, there's clearly dark clouds on the horizon that we'll find out if they turn out to be good news or bad news. You mentioned the increase in energy demand that's projected. Is that due to AI and the need to store increasing amounts of data? It clearly is, but you had also mentioned various forms of Bitcoin mining and EV movement over the grid. There's a bunch of different factors, the largest of which is AI and data centers, but the projections are incredible. What I would say, going back to my baseload versus intermittent, is that one of the things that's interesting is that it's a lot of what we're hearing from these very, very data-heavy technology companies is a need for baseload electricity, and you're hearing that they're contracting with old nuclear plants, and they're talking about new nuclear small modular reactors, so the amount of...I'd say the game of musical chairs that the technology players are playing is, we need to solidify the electric supply, which is the single largest input cost that they have in generating data centers for AI. Well, it's interesting because for years, there's been the talk of electrification, EVs, etc., more of the economy becoming electrified, but it seems like really in the past six months, since the beginning of this year, we've just seen more and more discussion about the increasing demands specifically related to AI data centers, storing data, things like that. Yeah, there were futurists that were talking about it, certainly this time last year, but you're right in terms of mainstream and in terms of, I think, public policy coming to grips with how big...I mean, a 5.5% compounded five-year rate of return is about a 35% total increase, and we're the largest system in the world in the United States, so you're talking about 350 gigawatts, 400 gigawatts of new generation that will be installed over the next five years just to keep up with demand if those projections are correct. As I said, it's going to be a game of musical chairs where it's not clear all demand is going to be satisfied. And what are the biggest challenges to meeting that demand growth that's needed? I think you have to take it sort of technology by technology. It certainly looks in the developed world that coal is on its way out almost completely. I think when I got into this business in the 1990s, coal was 55% of the generation across the country. This year, that will be well less than 20%, and I think you'll continue to see coal moving away, although CCUS may affect some older plants. Natural gas is going to be limited by where you can get gas. There's some parts of the country where you just can't get pipelines permitted under either party, and so you'll have to find other alternatives, and a lot of people are looking at the possibility of these small modular reactors in nuclear as a way of effectively bringing clean, low-carbon baseload, but that's hugely dependent upon not just costs coming down from $8 million to $10 million a megawatt versus less than $1.5 million for natural gas fuel, but it's also hugely dependent on nuclear regulation effectively becoming standardized so that certain components are approved in a factory and can be rolled out without each different small reactor having to have its own army of regulators. It's very, very speculative as to whether that's going to happen, but I would say against that backdrop of the grid growing by 35%, 40%, I should say the generation on the grid growing by 35%, 40%, there's huge projections that trillions of dollars are going to have to be spent on the transmission and distribution points. You're going to see, we think, more and more inside-the-fence deals as opposed to people buying off of the centralized grid. Distributed generation probably will continue to have traction, and so we really believe that we're in unprecedented times. Obviously, we've seen significant growth in traditional technologies like wind and solar, particularly solar in recent years, and now batteries have also become mainstream. What other technologies, and you mentioned a couple in your last answer, but what other technologies do you think are really interesting right now for investors, particularly with the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, now pretty much being fully in effect? I would say if you look backwards over the last 6 to 18 months since the, well, almost 24 months since the IRA was passed in August of 2022, there's been an awful lot of traction around hydrogen. There's been a lot of traction around CCUS. The SAF markets are trying very hard to scale sustainable aircraft fuel. The renewable natural gas markets have been trying to go, but in terms of baseload or intermittent generation, you're watching a bit of a resurgence in the geothermal market. We're seeing continued growth in utility-scale solar, largely coupled with storage. I say more and more frequently coupled with storage. Onshore wind works in most of the countries of the world, offshore wind works. We'll see whether the United States is going to really scale that market because that market clearly was hit very, very hard by the levelized cost of energy going up like crazy. I think most people, as they look at the future, and especially as they say this happens around baseload, is they're looking at renewables plus storage as supplemented by baseload power coming from either natural gas. There's been a huge amount of M&A around natural gas, largely around existing 10-year-old or less gas plants. We haven't yet seen the price in the M&A market exceed the cost to build new, so we haven't seen a lot of new plants being installed, but most people believe that it's either that the additional 35 gigawatts is going to come from the baseload component, at least will be coming from natural gas or small nuclear reactors. There was an article in the Journal this past couple of days where they were talking about a bunch of 20, 25-year-old reactors that had been operating for years as merchant plants. All of a sudden, I think Amazon has been signing up. Effectively, Amazon services have been buying out the power for the next 10 years. There's clearly going to be some pressure as that happens, then what does that leave the rest of the population for demand? Will that all be dirty energy? There's just massive amounts of public policy arguments that we still have in front of us, but I would say it's underpinned by this unprecedented demand we've never seen before. We mentioned public policy. I'll circle back to a comment you made before speaking about the presidential race. We're recording this on July 2nd, so just a few days after that debate. Now, I'm not going to do any political predictions or prognostications. Obviously, there's now in the renewable sector probably growing concern that there could be a Republican administration next year. How big a deal would the renewable energy industry see a change in administration? Would that be something that really shakes up the expected growth of the industry? Andrew, that is the multi-billion dollar question that everybody across our industry is asking. There's certainly a scenario where a Trump administration might say as a way of paying for what the Congressional Budget Office claims will be a $4 trillion cost of an extension of the 2017 tax cuts beyond 2025 when they're now supposed to expire. For Trump to get that done, he's going to need to have some pay-fors. The IRA, which initially was guesstimated at $360 billion in costs and has been estimated variously up to $2 trillion, might be a big down payment on that. I've heard some of the prospective vice presidents, notably the governor of North Dakota, say that's just completely speculative. It's not true. He's pretty on CCUS and a whole bunch of components of the IRA that he wouldn't want to see leave. I don't think anybody knows at this point, other than it's probably fair to say that short of a new Democratic-backed deal, the IRA was 100% partisan with no Republican votes, that some changes to the IRA are certainly possible. I don't think anybody really knows at this point how it all comes down. Is that affecting activity, including in the M&A market today in 2024, because of that uncertainty, or is this more of a concern looking forward? Well, it's clearly a concern looking forward. I think up to last week, the industry feeling was wild optimism, lots and lots of capital that had been raised around the sector, no real doubts about the public policy. I think Thursday's events clearly changed that. We heard some anecdotal evidence over the weekend with one would-be client that was going to do a capital raise that just said, I'm going to sell. I think at the margins, you're going to see people that will be trying to think about the long-term implications. I would say in the short term, what I think you're going to see is huge efforts towards safe harboring projects, so that projects that are coming out of 2024 are already grandfathered in for the ITC, for the PTC, for the various Section 45 credits. And that's what I would imagine that they have happened. It would be great if the would-be Republican administration would clarify their positions, and we'll see whether that happens. Well, that's interesting to hear, Ted. From my conversations, it seems like there's been concern that a change in administration could make a difference around the margins, but it's interesting to hear that now that concern seems to be growing, that there could be something like legislative changes to the IRA. Well, Ted, I really appreciate you joining me here today. That's all the time we have, but I think this has been a great conversation. Thank you very much for having me. And I would just say my opinions, while I do sit as the CEO of Marathon are mine, not Marathon's, so all I can say is that I'm long-term bullish and short-term a little bit nervous. Understood. And I think you speak not only for yourself, but many in the sector when you say that. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, listeners, for tuning into Crossroads.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, the news editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is Rich Dover, the founder and CEO of Dispatch Energy. And for the first time with myself as host, at least, we have Rich here live in studio with us. Rich, thank you for joining the Crossroads podcast today. Thank you for having me. Good to be here live. So usually I start these discussions, as listeners know, with an introduction of the guest's firm. But today, I actually want to start by talking a little bit about your background in this industry. Because Dispatch Energy is not the first time you've launched or helped launch a renewables firm, correct? Yeah, it's actually my fourth launch of a renewables firm. And I think with a fifth, you get a free punch, right? Yeah, something like that. Being an entrepreneur in this space has been an amazing learning experience. It's been the entirety of my career. And not everything that we've done has been as successful as we wanted it to be. But it's exciting to launch Dispatch from this period of my life, professionally and personally. And we're very excited about the new firm. So you have had some successes in the past. Your previous firm was C2 Energy, correct? Yeah. So why don't you talk a little bit about your experience there? Sure. So I was the co-founder and managing member of C2 Energy Capital. C2 started as a firm. Our original company name was actually C2 Special Situations Group. Our focus was on distributed generation. And about a year and a half into the business, what we really determined were two things. One, pretty much everything in distributed generation is inherently a special situation. And being in the position of an asset aggregator and developer, no one really wanted to feel like their asset was being acquired by a special situations group. So we changed the name to C2 Energy Capital. We founded the company in 2014. And we were able to grow the company organically until we sold most of our asset holdings. And most of the team was effectively acquired in March of 2021 by EDPR. So Rich, when did you decide to launch Dispatch Energy? And can you tell me a little bit about that firm and how it differs from your previous endeavor? After the acquisition of C2's holding company, I was the chief investment officer of the distributed generation unit in the U.S. for EDPR. And I left there last August, so August of 2023. And there were a number of assets that didn't go along with the sale, that just needed more development maturation, that C2 Energy Capital continued to develop. And after I left EDPR, we had to go out and get financing for those assets. And it was very surprising to me that the financing experience had actually gotten worse from prior to me selling the business three and a half years prior, which is distressing on a number of different levels. You want this industry to be evolving. You want the financing markets to become more efficient. And it just seemed like it had gone in the opposite direction. Maybe that has to do with us, but I don't think it had anything to do with our team. And we have a proven track record and capital, and these were good assets. And so as I started to think about what I wanted to do with the next step of my career, I've been working in this sector for over 15 years, almost exclusively focused on distributed generation. I personally believe that the impact from an environmental standpoint, from a grid stability standpoint, from an energy transition standpoint, of distributed generation is so important. And it's just an area that I think still not only needs a lot of work, but inherent within that is also a lot of opportunity. So Rich, just pausing because we have listeners from different parts of the energy and infrastructure sector. Can you explain what distributed generation is for those who aren't as familiar? I think the technical threshold is projects that are sub 20 megawatts AC. But I think in the sort of energy project finance world, I think that from a capital standpoint, it's really projects that are sub $50 million that would encompass distributed generation. It's not only the technical limitation, but it's also just projects that require lower amounts of capital and the need to build operations around them that can efficiently deploy smaller amounts of capital. And what made you want to focus on distributed generation versus other parts of the energy sector? Well, initially, you know, I studied energy policy when I was an undergrad, and I always liked DG for, you know, for the reasons I said, you know, from an environmental impact, from a grid stability and positive components from the energy transition. So from that, I've always been fascinated with DG. I think that I get excited about things that are harder to do. I think that there's definitely a lot of work and complexity associated with larger infrastructure projects, obviously. But DG has to be done with different levels of complication, but a supreme level of efficiency if you're going to make any money. And I do think that businesses in the energy transition do need to be capitalist endeavors. They need to be profitable endeavors in order to be successful. So I like the challenge. I enjoy the impact, and I'm proud of what I do. And it's always been fun, and it's treated me well in my career. And does Dispatch Energy only invest in and develop DG projects, or are there other parts of the sector or other sectors that you're focused on, too? Yeah, so Dispatch Energy will be a vertically integrated energy transition firm. So what that means is we are, unlike C2, which was really almost in this non-exact ratio, but, you know, 90% asset aggregation and 10% project development, Dispatch will have services component to it, which will be doing EPC execution, potentially some energy-oriented advisory, project development, and acting as an IPP. Across the distributed generation spectrum of activities, that's what the business plan is. As well as being able to provide a number of other technological solutions beyond just solar energy storage, which is what C2 had focused on. So we are doing solar storage, fuel cell, CHP, and electrification as our business mandate. And that is all derived from looking at this from a customer-first perspective. At this point, solar is just a different execution endeavor. It's become much more commoditized, and a lot of the low-hanging fruit has been picked. In distributed generation, more broadly, we need to be an efficient provider of customer-oriented solutions. So we want to build the best product for the customer. That doesn't necessarily always mean doing another solar project. It means developing the best customer-oriented solution and bringing what we believe is our secret sauce, which is our team's problem-solving and creativity to bear to be able to implement these types of solutions. Very interesting. And Infralogic reported, I think it was last month, that you're in the process of raising capital. How are you finding the market there? The market has been very receptive to the business plan and our management team. There was a lot of excitement about distributed generation between 2020 and 2022. And now a lot of those platforms are going through a reckoning of how to become profitable businesses. We have a track record in building a profitable distributed generation business, so there's been a lot of interest from investors from having that track record. And we are excited to be able to provide what we believe is the best customer offering that is going to be available out there. And so in that regard, the investor community, I think, understands that we're trying to very effectively balance the two main things that you want to do for investors, which is make the money and have a good product. So you launched your last firm in 2014. Now it's 2024, 10 years later. How different is the market, and are there similarities between then and now? Well, I guess the old adage, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I think that when we launched C2, we were in an environment where capex was high but dropping. We were in an environment where interest rates were higher, particularly for DG and dropping, and a world where valuations were increasing. What's been interesting in terms of observing this new market is how some of those phenomena play out. We're in a world where capex has meaningfully gone up over the last two to three years in the post-COVID era. We obviously are in a world where interest rates have meaningfully gone up in the last two to three years. But exotically, it's a world where also valuations seem to be going up, so it's hard for me to reconcile those factors some days. But we think that there is, as I said before, a reckoning that is going to be happening in the market, and there will be a good opportunity for us to invest profitably, but while also being cognizant of the cyclical nature of not only solar, but now obviously more broadly the distributed generation segment, the old comment from solar veterans is the solar coaster. I would say that we are appropriately past the top crest of the solar coaster, but we haven't hit the valley yet. I think that within that, there will be a lot of good investment opportunities and opportunities to build very strong businesses. When you should mention solar coaster, our last guest was from Nuveen, who had just published a paper called The Solar Coaster, and that was a big topic of that conversation. Our listeners can go back and listen to that episode, too, but that's definitely a theme we hear coming again and again. Now, you mentioned you think there's going to be something of a reckoning. I'm wondering if you could expand on that. What do you think that's going to look like? Renewables as we know it is really a consequence of the 2008 economic crisis, and so whether it's the cash grant program in the US or the feed-in tariff programs in Europe and the consequential manufacturing boom to serve both of those that came from Asia, we've seen different moments of renewables and energy transition as an economic stimulus. We've seen it being pushed up as a form of economic stimulus. We've seen it being pushed as a form of good environmental stewardship. What is happening now, which is interesting relative to renewables and I'd say the renewable industry as a whole, it's really unlike those other periods which represent moments in time that is a problem to be served. I think that the next era of renewables is about providing a true service that is needed. There are obviously major gaps in power demand, and the ability for renewables to fill that gap is, I think, an awesome capability. No one wants a coal plant in their backyard, and while there are permitting issues associated and sometimes permitting efforts to try and fight new wind and new solar, I think that if you were to ask any of the people who would actually be legitimately fighting that, whether or not they'd rather have a solar farm or a coal plant on the farm next door, they'd probably prefer a solar farm. There is an opportunity for the renewable industry to come out of its primordial ooze here to take its role as a true energy solutions provider for industrial policy in the United States and beyond. That is a very exciting dynamic. We are not in a world where renewables have to compete exclusively as a low commoditized cost of power, but also being able to provide a broader set of benefits and a type of power that people want comparatively more than others. I think particularly as it relates to dispatch and distributed generation, I think there's an even more amazing opportunity there because the types of projects that we're developing and that we are so excited about can provide so much in terms of incremental services like resiliency and capacity and demand management that are going to be hard for some of the larger scale projects to be able to do in short order. Distributed allows for, particularly in the US, what I think is one of the most American things, which is self-determination. I'm very excited to see how the industry at a macro level can take its place at the policy stage and as a service stage. Particularly within that and what excites me is the way that distributed can play such an important technical role. Another major theme that we're hearing about, especially the last couple months, is the way that AI and the need to process all the data that goes along with it has upended assumptions about energy demand. All of a sudden, there's the expectation that they're going to need a lot more energy going forward than the industry really considered a few years back. It's becoming, from what we've heard, less a question of simply replacing fossil fuels with renewables and more a question of are we going to have enough energy and what role are renewables going to play there? How does that factor in? How does distributed generation help close that gap? I would take a little bit of a contrarian view on the fact that the renewables industry didn't see that there would be increasing power demand. It was always very interesting to me when we were having conversations five, six years ago. You're talking about electrification and trying to repatriate the manufacturing base of the US that for some reason that just never translated into long-term energy curves increasing. I think what AI has done in a way that is so apparent and visible is make a much broader community of people. I think I saw something that chat GPT is one of the most recognizable brand names even amongst 75, 80-year-olds. I don't think if you would talk to that same group of individuals as a whole and saying that the transformation to electric cars and what electrification was going to do to load management was going to be as profound as it is. I think that AI has really brought that to the forefront in terms of the compute requirement that it's needed. Look, there are people – Jigar Shah has been touting this for years about what is going to need to happen in terms of an energy demand and energy transition standpoint. As it relates to distributed, I think distributed can play such an important role because it can provide really targeted and focused services. Dispatch energy, the name dispatch is a nod to where we believe the energy markets are going to go where we're going to have to have assets that are going to need to be more interactive with the market than just pumping another kilowatt hour into a client. That's why we call the company that. Ultimately, where we see the puck going is the ability for distributed assets as either standalone or as part of virtual power plant schemes to be desperately important service to grid stability. It can negate the need for costly and timely upgrades. Look, I was just meeting yesterday with one of the largest real estate, industrial real estate owners in the country. The ability to even just provide power without having to spend $50 million to upgrade a substation is consistently on their clients' top question list. Distributed can step into providing that service. We're very excited about it. We think that this is something that once the market understands more about what the technologies that are off the shelf and available and imminently deployable that are out there can provide this great service. Also, we fully expect and we will be demanding of our utility partners that they provide us with the credit and the value that we can bring as a technical partner. Another major challenge for the renewables industry as a whole has been interconnection issues. Is DG better suited for dealing with that, or are DG assets also facing the same challenges? There's no doubt that as it relates to a typical greenfield, ground-mounted DG project that you're going to face similar interconnection challenges. It may not be as profound as a 100-plus megawatt project, but you're still dealing with interconnection delays. I think that a lot of that comes from a true desire for the grid operators to really want to operate a stable grid. Whether you're doing one 100-meg project or five 20-meg projects or 25-megawatt projects, you still have a responsibility to do that well. I do think that there is a desire and good faith to be able to do that from the grid operators. That being said, I think that distributed, if designed properly and working towards the appropriate long-term technical goal of a particular site, can do things to save itself some pain and suffering. The integration, obviously, of solar plus storage is a very simple example of being able to store power on site and limit net metering or other grid impacts that might be a consequence of building a distributed generation facility. As such, you're just not as much of a technical interaction with the grid. I'm very bullish about distributed generation being able to circumvent a lot of the—or maybe not circumvent, but avoid a lot of the interconnection pitfalls. What I think is needed is a level of technical collaboration with the utilities that makes us a partner rather than just saying, oh, well, I don't want to deal with these interconnection issues, and because I'm distributed, you should not make it as much my problem. We are in a community where, whether it's a technical, an ISO community, a local community where we're developing and building projects, I think we need to make sure that we are coming up with the right solutions. Honestly, it's harder because it's getting more advanced, and we have to be more nuanced. I think just like any other industry, investing in real estate in New York is hard. You can't just buy something and then hope that it goes up. You've got to improve it. You've got to make the right investments. You've got to think about things in a more sophisticated manner. I think that that is part of the coming-of-age story of renewables generally, but particularly of distributed generation. Well, Richard, thank you. This has been a very interesting conversation.

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior policy reporter for InfraLogic, and I'm extremely fortunate today to be joined by Matt Shanahan, managing director of Marathon Capital. Matt has a great wealth of experience developing financing solutions for the renewable energy transition, particularly in the area of tax equity transactions. I'll be speaking with him today about the current state of the renewable energy sector and the major factors that are likely to shape the industry in the near future. Matt, thank you so much for joining us today. Thanks, Chuck. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about tax equity and tax credit transfers in the post-IRA world. Well, there's obviously a lot going on in the renewable energy sector right now, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on all of those. But I wonder if you could start by telling listeners a little bit about yourself and the work that you do with Marathon Capital. Sure, Chuck. Thanks for the opportunity to talk here. I manage the tax equity advisory practice at Marathon Capital. So what we do there is we primarily raise tax equity for developers for wind projects, solar projects, standalone storage and carbon capture projects. And just to step back a little bit and make sure we understand and define what tax equity investment is, in the US energy market, the primary incentive at the federal level are tax benefits, tax credits and accelerated depreciation deductions. But in order to get value out of those tax credits, a developer has to be a taxpayer, right? Because the tax credits reduce taxes otherwise you would pay to the federal government. Very, very few developers of renewable energy projects have the quantum of tax liabilities that can absorb the tax credits falling out of these projects. So the solution in order to generate, get benefits out of these credits is to form a partnership with a large taxpaying institution, have the partnership acquire the project, and then allocate 99% of the tax attributes to that investor and a minority of the cash so that the developer essentially indirectly gets the benefits of these tax credits and other tax benefits by raising capital whose return is primarily paid with tax credits they can't otherwise use. So these are, you know, they're equity investors, but they're primarily paid with tax incentives. So hence the phrase tax equity. In addition to a tax equity partnership transaction, the IRA allowed the direct transfer of tax credits, i.e. if I'm a developer and I'm developing a solar project and I have $100 million of investment tax credits, I can actually sell that $100 million to an unrelated party for cash. So much simpler transaction, I turn around, I sell that 100, maybe I get $95 million for it. And now that cash goes to help build out the project. So in the current market, we're seeing, you know, both the tax equity investments and transfer transactions, as well as what we call hybrid transactions, where the parties form a tax equity partnership, but the tax equity partnership then turns around and transfers the tax credits. And that allows two things. One, when you transfer a tax credit, you cannot transfer accelerated depreciation, which also has value. In a tax equity partnership, you know, the accelerated depreciation benefits, you know, are allocated to the tax equity and do generate value. So with a hybrid transaction, you do monetize that depreciation. In addition to that, because the partnership is selling the tax credits, it opens up the tax equity investor to be able to do additional business because now they're not using all of their tax capacity and taking the tax credits. So to put the numbers on where the market is, historically, the last three years, the tax equity market has been an $18 to $20 billion a year market in terms of new investment per year. When you look at the volume of new business that the IRA would drive by the extension of the ITC and PTCs out to 2032, the extension of ITC to standalone storage, the offshore wind tax credits, and carbon capture and clean hydrogen tax credits, you easily get to a demand which is two to three times the $18 to $20 billion a year. So now you need $40 to $60 billion a year of tax capital. And what we're starting to see in the market is that the volume of traditional tax equity is probably about the same, but a lot of that growth, most of the growth is coming out of the transfer market by U.S. corporations acquiring tax credits, either in straight transfer transaction or in a hybrid transaction. So those are some pretty eye-popping numbers. You mentioned that a lot of that is driven by these incentives in the IRA, as well as the opening up of this tax credit transfer market through the legislation. Over the past couple of years, we've also had a lot of turbulence in the macroeconomic landscape where interest rates have been a lot higher, inflation has been a lot higher, the cost of capital has been a lot higher relative to what we've seen over the past couple of decades. I wonder with that in mind, if you could talk a little bit about the net effect of all these changes on the investment landscape for renewable energy right now in 2024. Yeah, so you've got two things going on, right? The tax credits, which are driving an expansion of the industry, but as you point out, interest rates being much higher and costs going up considerably, which you drive the other way. So what we've seen in the past probably a year and a half and maybe two years now is a kind of resetting of expectations. Just a little history. Traditionally, particularly in the solar market, you know, the costs were coming down significantly each year. And so a lot of the, you know, really the way developers work is they secure an offtake agreement, a PPA, you know, develop the project for two to three more years, watch those costs come down considerably, and then, you know, kind of reap the benefits through a development fee. Now, what flipped around starting probably about 2022 is costs started to go up, not go down, but started to increase, and that was due to general inflationary pressures, you know, coming out of the COVID era and, you know, tariffs on solar panels. So it started to work the other way, where all of a sudden these, you know, these offtakes that had been secured two to three years ago made the projects uneconomical at current build costs. In addition to that, you had increasing interest rates, so your cost of capital is going up. So what we saw was a great resetting of offtake rates, of PPA rates. And in some cases, there were voluntary restructurings. In some cases, there were just terminations, you know, for fees usually. And now we're starting to see a more balanced market where the offtakes are more in line with the costs and the cost of capital to build these structures. So it went through a period of renegotiation, but I would say for the most part, it became very clear that the market for renewable power was strong enough that the offtakers renegotiated these power purchase agreements and allowed these projects to move forward. Kind of one exception to that would be if you look at the offshore wind industry, where you had a really significant increase in cost, and there have not been so much renegotiations as terminations of the power purchase agreements because they're uneconomical, and that's going to go through a resetting process as we move forward. Yes, and those are developments we've been following at Infologic. It's been kind of a soap opera with the ups and downs of the offshore wind sector, but hopefully we're seeing that begin to reset. Overall, does it seem like with this kind of re-stabilization you're describing in the onshore renewables sector that development and demand for investment are continuing to remain strong? Very strong. Yes, absolutely. So you've got solar continuing to grow, wind growing, but not because of time of day generation that solar has an advantage, right? We're probably seeing more solar than wind, but some wind, and a lot of standalone storage now that it's eligible for the ITC, which of course, if you look at markets with high renewable penetration, you really need storage, and that if you look at Texas and California particularly as storage markets. And you mentioned the sort of major role that transferability of the tax credits plays in the tax equity landscape or the investment landscape, particularly with this massive increase in the available tax credits in the market. I know when this was sort of initially discussed as a policy proposal, one of the benefits that was kind of advertised was that it would allow smaller developers to monetize these tax credits in a way that traditionally hasn't been as easy for them to do through the traditional tax equity market. They don't have the ongoing relationships with these tax equity financers. Their projects don't tend to be as large enough to draw as much interest from the traditional market. Does it seem like small developers have been able to access financing more easily through the transfer deals? No, no question about it. So if you look at the kind of traditional tax equity market, these are generally very large commercial banks who prefer doing business with very large global developers, right? So that has, you pointed out, left smaller developers unable to access that capital. Now through the ability to transfer tax credits, we are seeing these projects. And I'd say it's more than just small developers. It's perhaps projects in regions that were troubled because of curtailment issues or basis issues. It's newer developers who may be sizable, but it's the first time into the U.S. market who may have struggled to get tax equity. Now all of those parties are able to access the transfer market. The other piece that's been helpful, particularly for small developers, and when you enter into a tax credit transfer agreement, the seller has to make a number of representations, right, with respect to the qualification of the tax credit, the level of the tax credit. And you have to back that with an indemnity. Now a lot of these smaller developers don't necessarily have the credit to get buyers comfortable, but the insurance market, the tax credit insurance market has really stepped into that void. And we're starting to see a lot of insurance products out there now. So for the smaller developer, then pay the insurance premium, sell the tax credit, get the capital and build out their projects. And speaking of all these changes to the investment environment of renewable energy, we can't ignore the fact that we are in an election year in the United States where the policies and rhetoric of the two parties around fossil and renewable energy diverge pretty starkly. How are investors in the renewable energy sector reacting to uncertainty over which party will be in power come January? Yeah, I think for the most part, it's still full speed ahead. But watching the elections fairly carefully, I mean, our analysis is that, first of all, the big change comes with a clean sweep, right? If you have a Republican House, Senate and White House, then you have potential for change. The biggest issue out there, we believe, is what happens to the 2017 tax cuts that are due to expire? We believe, and it's been pretty public, that's going to be a priority of a Trump administration is to extend those credits. That costs money, a lot of money. And so the question is, where do you look for money to plug the holes if you do? And I think that one of the things that we would be concerned about is what's called the tech neutral ITC and PTC tax credits that kick in, I think, next year and continue in 2032 probably could be at risk. We think the 45Q carbon capture has fairly broad bipartisan support, so probably not at risk. And one of the things we've been encouraging our clients to think about is going back and what's called grandfathering projects so that they qualify for the current ITC and PTC, so that no matter what happens through the next four years, you get your tax credits for at least for the ITC and the PTC. But as you point out, it's a very much different outcome depending on exactly how that election goes. So we're not seeing a slowdown in development, but people watching it very, very carefully. Well, I'm sure until November, we will all be on the edge of our seats. Matt, thanks so much for joining us today, and I hope you find the time to stop by the podcast again really soon. Thank you.

This is your host, Eva Llorenz, the Latin American senior reporter for Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest is Adrian Lara, Principal Analyst, Upstream Latin America for Global Data and Analytics Provider, Wood McKenzie. Thank you, Eva. I'm glad to be here. Thanks for having me. So, why don't you tell us a little bit about your background? So, as you said, I'm the Principal Analyst for the Upstream Research Team with Wood McKenzie. I'm based in Mexico City, and from here, basically, together with another team based in Brazil, we cover most of the Latin American countries. And although the focus is the upstream sector, we ultimately overlap with other energy segments, and as you can imagine, also with energy policy and the politics of the key producing countries in the region. Before, I was also with another consulting research energy firm for about 10 years. I've been doing this. And before that, if you have me go back to my beginnings in the energy sector, I started my career with the national company here in Mexico, Pemex. I was part of the trading arm, and that was many years ago. I was more focused on the markets and logistics of commodities traded by the company. That's more or less the summary of my career. Recently, Claudia Schoenbein, a member of the National Regeneration Party, became the first female president in Mexico's history. Schoenbein is a scientist and a politician who served as Secretary of the Environment under current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. She was also head of Mexico City's government, and she's slated to replace the current president in October. Of course, she has many challenges as president. Can you discuss with us, Mr. Lara, explain the challenges Mexico faces to meet energy demands, and how did we get to this point? Sure, Eva. Our view is that it's basically the lack of enough investment or underinvestment, which has basically got Mexico to the point of having its energy supply feeling some stress for delivering. Currently, and of course, when you look at the growth of that demand, being very challenged in meeting that growth in demand with its current energy supply. The more detailed answer to your question is, of course, there's been underinvestment due to a lack of opportunities, and that will apply across not just oil and gas, but also power, and within power, renewable power. And that, to some extent, is connected in the recent years to an increase in the regulatory, say, hurdles that we've seen in the additional bureaucracy that is there for instance, permitting and bringing new projects to the first sort of levels of production. And I think it's also important to note that in this current administration, there's been a change in the, say, approach that has basically favored national companies. And in that, I mean the oil and gas national company, Pemex, the national power utility company known as CFE. And that has come at the expense of somehow excluding or disincentivizing investment from private actors. That's something that we think at the moment is at the core of how this new administration is going to redefine the role that public investment is going to be complemented by private investment. Just curious as to, could you elaborate a little bit more on how did we get to this point? Yeah, sure. I think if you ask me, and I'm going to break it down here by segment, right? In the case of oil and gas, what's happened is the national oil company, Pemex, they've been investing, they've always invested, and to be clear, this administration has actually managed to stop the decline of production that came from many years before. But we think that although that investment has been enough to somehow stabilize the production, there's a requirement for additional exploration if you want that plateau to remain. In other words, we see that by the end of this decade, that decline is going to go and be steep again. And for somehow to counter it, you need to have that additional exploration. And in there lies part of what we've seen, the fact that there hasn't been enough successful exploration by Pemex, and also the fact that even though the reform that took place at the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014 allowed for bidding rounds that basically brought different international companies and some local ones to explore in Mexico, that was successful up to a point where those bidding rounds were halted during this administration. So there is certainly a connection between that lack of bidding rounds and the fact that no more discoveries have been made or not enough discoveries have been made in the recent years, right? That's for the case of oil and gas. For the case of power generation, there are many years of underinvestment, right? And not just power generation, but also in the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is needed. There is a combination of mismanagement of, in this case, the investment of the power utility, national power utility company, but also the fact that the bidding rounds, or sorry, in the case of power, more the long-term auctions, right? Were also allowed by that energy reform of 2013 were halted in this administration. In short, there is an immediate effect for this last five years, right? That is coming from somehow restricting that private investment through the bidding rounds or through the auctions. And to some extent, also the fact that the national companies, right? Probably not invested or the strategy in general hasn't been the most successful in terms of increasing their output. Well, thank you very much. How is Mexico going to overcome this incredible challenges that it is facing, especially in the energy sector? The short answer, right? It's how logical is you need more investment, but we think that investment has to be public and private and the public investment has to be as efficient as possible, right? So if I go back to that case of Pamex, I was explaining in my previous answer, Pamex has been investing in the last five years in certain projects, mainly onshore and shallow water projects that are perhaps not the most profitable, or in other words, they are costly, right? But of course they contribute to production, but that is not necessarily the best, say, portfolio of projects in which the company can or should be investing. But those are the ones that are possible for different reasons, right? This should be, in the case of Pamex, for instance, a refocus of the strategy where projects that are developed are more profitable, right? And the same logic would apply, of course, to the power utility national company. And then in terms of private investment, I think the key aspect is that these regulatory hurdles, or in general, the regulatory framework now has to become more attractive and more stable, right? So as I mentioned during this current administration, the last five years, we've witnessed changes to that framework that basically create uncertainty for investors. There was, for instance, a reform to the power sector that was impacting the power generation in the country that ultimately, although it was approved, was reversed by the Supreme Court, right? Because there were several cases of appealing for the reversal of it. And ultimately, well, that brought things to, say, the status quo. But that risk of implementing such type of reforms is right now, I think, in the head of investors and operators, right? That might be already operating in Mexico or considering coming to Mexico. I have a question regarding that, because obviously, we're going to have a new president coming in, and trying to recuperate or recover the ground that was lost, possibly under the current president, in terms of foreign investment is going to be very, very difficult. I am just curious as to, can you provide a little bit more specific as to what does the new president need to do to gain that trust again, from investors? I mean, I know you mentioned some of them, but if you could be more specific. Sure. I think right now, as you know, the election was just a few days ago, right? And there's a lot of expectations around many questions in the environment that are required in an answer, not just in terms of energy. I think the framework here is that there are basically two scenarios that can evolve, simply put. One is one where this new administration, led by Claudia Sheinbaum, follows the energy nationalism that was implemented or pushed for by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. And that basically meant strengthening the national companies, as I mentioned, but in halting the bidding rounds and long-term auctions for power. That's in summary what could continue. The other scenario is where Claudia Sheinbaum deviates from this. And that's what I meant by that's a big question in the air right now. Is she going to be able to deviate? And I think her background is somehow what is given that interpretation, right? And that she's by training as a scientist, she has a doctorate in energy engineering. She was a contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And then she was an academic and somehow that is there. But also during the campaign, she was more, in general, a bit more biased towards talking or supporting renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, right? So there is that part where it basically gives some context to say, okay, perhaps that's going to prevail and then she could go that route. But then, of course, she will have to deal, and this is an added aspect or outcome of the election, with the fact that there is now practically a qualified majority in Congress. And that Congress also has somehow a logic, political logic, where they probably can assume they want to continue with the line of Mr. López Obrador. And so what she will need to do is, in our view, be very careful with the pace at which reforms could be sent to Congress, right? Of course, the content of those reforms, right? In terms of the energy segment or the energy sector, as I mentioned, there were already from previous, from the current, still current administration, reforms that could impact the way the power sector functions, right? Specifically, reforms that will give even more prerogatives, right, by law to the national utility company. And that will act as a, that basically will be a lack of incentive, right, for attracting investment. So it's important that the content of that law, it's well assessed before, in the case that it is sent to Congress, right? In terms of Pemex, I mentioned, right, there are some immediate requirements, right? Pemex has a major debt. It's the most indebted oil company in the world with a debt of over $100 billion in US dollars. Just the next three years, that payment can be over $40 billion. There's, of course, during this administration, some measures that the government has taken and basically, well, taking over some of that debt indirectly. And that risk then has passed from Pemex to, say, public finances. And that's something that is basically not sustainable, right, to the view of many observers. And so something has to be done about it in the short term, right? Something has to be addressed. Recently, in the country, we've seen power outages, right, in this last few months. And that's not going to change or, let's say, the risk is still there, right? Because this is basically a product of not having enough power generation and transmission, as I mentioned earlier, right? And it's impacting more certain regions more than others, but it's not going to go away, right? Because any new power generation capacity that is in line to or projects that will start, in our view, starting until 2025, 2026, right? So it's something that has to be dealt with immediately. And so we think that, as I mentioned, Pemex, I mentioned the power outages, those are immediate concerns. For the longer term, we think the building grounds, for instance, in terms of oil and gas, right, are necessary because there is a respective resource in Mexico. And by that I mean, let's say, oil and gas undiscovered resources, right, somehow outlined or estimated generally, but still need exploration to be effectively turned into research. But that research is still very massive, right, in both onshore and offshore areas of the country. And we think that it's necessary not even for increasing production massively, but even for just maintaining the current level of production that we see in the country, right, which is around 1.8 million barrels per day. We think that is something that should be reassessed. Mexico has, in comparison to other countries in the region, good prospective resources, I mentioned, but also fiscal terms are relatively well placed, right? So in terms of how fiscally you compete with other countries in the region, it's well positioned, it can be improved as well. But we think it's something that at the moment, it's completely uncertain whether it's going to happen, right, but it's nonetheless necessary. And finally, for power generation, the same, right? We think that in terms of renewable energy, it is necessary that those longer term auctions, right, that were allowed during the energy reform come back, right? And of course, there is a bit more of context. Besides the auctions, there's also a need for more certainty, right, in the regulatory framework that I mentioned earlier. But there's no other way in which Mexico, we think, can meet those energy demands. Or the other way is not only with public investment that you're going to meet them, but you necessarily will need private capital there too. Yes. Mr. Lara, you've mentioned all of the challenges that Mexico is currently facing. I'm just curious as to what are the challenges then from an investor's point of view? What are some of the challenges that energy investors are going to be facing down the road in Mexico? Yes. Well, right now, as I mentioned, there's a lack of certainty for the ones that are already operating and the ones that we're considering Mexico as a viable investment option, right? I think in terms of the companies that are already operating, let me again go by sector, right, because that's probably easier, right? Sure. Some of them might consider leaving the country or take their investments somewhere else in the region, right? And here I'm talking about companies that are still trying to find or have oil and gas projects in their portfolio, right? You can think of several international companies or even national companies that operate internationally, right? The companies that operate here, right, the few that were able to have discoveries of enough size and that basically turned into a project just will continue operating here. The risk is perhaps more in terms of not being able to expand their investment with additional projects, but perhaps just managing the production that they're going to have over the next few years, right? In terms of the, say, other segments, such as the power sector, there we think that it's definitely more nuanced in terms of how the government is going to give, again, or could give some more prerogatives to the national power utility company in that that company is now aimed to secure 54% of the overall power generation market, right? And that basically means that you're guaranteeing for the company, or look in another way, you're reducing that 46% that remains, right? That's where any private company operating in the company will have to compete with other power generators, right? And that is ultimately a risk for fully utilizing your installed capacity, right? You might end up not using it fully, right? Because basically, effectively, your microchair has been reduced, and that in the end also impacts your profitability, right? So those are very clear risks in our view that might be impacting profitability of these companies. You mentioned in your report that there is an unexpected decline in production post-2030. So I'm just curious as to what changes need to take place to avoid that post-production decline post-2030. So as I mentioned earlier, Pemex has managed to stabilize production in this last five years. That's something to be recognized, right? And they've contributed with about 500,000 barrels per day. So that's additional production that has helped or that's mitigated that decline, stabilized production, right? But that production, those 500,000 barrels per day, are going to decline rather steeply towards the end of the decade. And so to avoid that, what you need to do is start developing projects or bring new production before you get to that point, right? And the reality is that Pemex at the moment doesn't have a company. It's restricted in the number of fields that could be brought to production to compensate that decline, right? And so in short, what they need is to be more successful in exploration, right? The company has been investing about 10% of the total budget in exploration, right? And most of that has gone to exploration and shallow water. For the 2025-2026 period, they have now budgeted an additional almost a billion dollars for investment in deep water, right? Which is good in the sense of basically getting out of that shallow water onshore focus that they've had. But at the same time, it's not guaranteed that they're going to find enough resources or discoveries that are going to be successful, right? Because exploration has a risky nature, right? And where many of the wells that you might be drilling could be dry, right? So in other words, you need to increase your investment in exploration just to increase your chances, right? So in short, that's what we think is required, that investment in exploration increases by Pemex. What risks or challenges Mexico will face in terms of integrating itself to the U.S. energy market? I know that has been a topic that has been mentioned lately. Yes, it's an interesting question. And from our perspective, it's a complex situation in that on the one hand, you are Mexico, right? It's a nation that's very well connected to the U.S. You can think in terms of natural gas, right? The imports of natural gas from Mexico are getting close to 80% of the total demand in Mexico at the moment. And that's basically, or it's allowed by the fact that you have interconnection, right? From the pipeline perspective, most of these imports come through pipeline and the production in the U.S. is there, right? It's mainly at the moment, production of natural gas from Texas, right? From the Permian Basin. So from that perspective, there's a good integration, right? There's been a, say, a risk in it or a downside. And back in 2021, there was a freeze in Texas that basically logistically interrupted exports from the U.S. to Mexico. And that, of course, translated into an economic loss for mainly foreign industry, right? In the northern part of the country, right? But some solution to it could be just building more gas storage, which Mexico don't have, right? At the moment, it doesn't even reach five days of full demand, right? And there's been initiatives to do that, but they are still on hold. But that could be one way of mitigating that sort of risk. But then there's this other aspect, right? Of the integration, which is, I've seen it during this current administration of President Biden, where they've been more careful in, or they call to review how they are permitting for liquefying natural gas exports, right? And that in general connects to the fact that the U.S. also has to be careful in terms of its energy security, right? And because you are basically somehow depleting your gas reserves, right, in this case, and exporting them worldwide. But that is all premised in that the U.S. at some point is going to transition, right? To be less dependent on natural gas. And there are estimates for it, but there's always a risk that you fall behind, and at some point you have less gas. And that basically means that you probably have to pay more for it, right? So there's that risk and that relationship or integration with Mexico that at some point, perhaps the U.S. decides that it's not as easy to permit exports to Mexico. But we think it's, as of now, a low probability for it. In terms of, let's not leave it out, in terms of oil and refined products, there's also a clear dependence, right, if you want to put it that way, from Mexico in the importing gasoline and diesel from the U.S. And Mexico has exported historically heavy crude oil to the complex U.S. called refineries, right, in the U.S. And that, right now, in terms of oil exports, perhaps being redefined, it might change because Mexico's production has been decreasing and also because Mexico wants to process more or refine more oil in Mexico. So, in short, that could mean that exports to the U.S. of heavy Mexican crude oil could reduce significantly in the future. But in terms of gasoline and diesel imports from Mexico to the U.S., that's still there. And there is, again, coming back to that argument of how this government has looked for self-sufficiency, right? Somehow the example of it has been increasing gasoline production domestically so that we reduce our imports from gasoline and diesel from the U.S. But in the short term, I think that's not going to change significantly. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, I am putting this in three questions into one. Obviously, Mexico needs to go do an energy transition. I'm curious to know as to how much money would Mexico need to make its energy transition and who will be financing these projects, in your opinion? And are there any important energy projects coming out of Mexico and which are they? First one, how much is required? That's, of course, a complicated question in that you need to somehow factor in the substitution that you need to do from fossil fuels. But before I get into that, let me put it this way. We think that in Mexico, if you look at renewable energy in a way, that's sort of how the low-hanging fruit of the energy transition in that. And actually, Mexico already had commitments to reaching more than 40 percent, 43 percent, which translates to 40 gigawatts of renewable power generation by the end of this decade. And of course, as with other countries, Mexico is not going to meet that. In our latest forecast, of those 40 gigawatts, I think we're getting to 28 gigawatts, less than 30 by the end of this decade. Later in the 2030s, it somehow catches up. But there's always going to be that challenge. But so what I'm saying here is that investing in renewable energy, which is an empowered generation, a segment that now worldwide requires a minimum or no subsidies or policy support from government, is the first way of tackling that challenge of investing effectively in your energy transition. So that's the first thing to do and connects with what we've been discussing here. For that, we need to make sure that the power sector has the right framework. And ideally, that anything that is reform or past impacting sector includes or is very clear in how to attract private investment for renewable energy infrastructure. That's one aspect. The other thing, and this is what I was meaning before, is that outside power, the power sector, there's really no, at the moment, no major decarbonizing projects in Mexico. And here I'm talking about carbon capture and storage, hydrogen projects, electrification of transport. All of that is really practice, non-system. And that means that there's a need for incentivizing that investment. And as with what we're seeing worldwide, there needs to be some sort of direct, specific or special funding for those type of projects because normally their profitability is quite low or perhaps they are not even profitable. And so Mexico has condition, right? Investing in this new energy segments to having some sort of specific funding, right? That's what you see in this conference of the parties events, right? Certain countries are, well, in general, it's a major issue, how you're going to be able to make that investment flow, right? Let's say economies, emerging economies or economies that are still have development paths, right? And that still need energy, electrification in certain parts of their countries, right? And so I think that's a more challenging number to estimate, right? But I think just going back to fear of investment or renewable energy, we're talking about at least, depending on what are your assumptions and certain analysis, at least a hundred billion over the next 10 to 15 years, right? U.S. dollars, right? You know, as reference, you know, what Claudia Chamberlain was proposing during her campaign was 13 U.S. dollars, 13 billion, right? For renewable energy, right? So it's definitely more than that, right? Some estimates are indicating at least eight to 10 billion U.S. dollars per year. And that will be only just that first part of the energy transition. Well, those were all of the questions that we have for Mr. Lara. I want to thank you, Mr. Lara, very much for participating in Crossroads. Thank you very much. Again, glad to be able to share our opinions and analysis with you. I would like to thank the audience for listening to Crossroads. I am your host, Eva Llorenz.

I am InfraLogic senior reporter Eugene Gilligan. My guest today is Robert Poole. Robert is director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation. The Reason Foundation released its 2024 annual privatization report on transportation finance earlier this month. The report found that global infrastructure funds raised over $1 trillion over the last five years, with revenue generating transportation assets continuing to attract the largest share of their investments. Mr. Poole will discuss some of the report's key findings with a particular focus on U.S. assets and what these findings may mean as we move ahead this year. Bob, welcome to the podcast. Thank you for joining us today. Thanks very much, Gene. I'm glad to be here today. Thanks. Let's lead off. What were some of the key trends in investment from infrastructure funds, and what are you keeping an eye on this year? Well, I think it's interesting that despite the $1 trillion markup, you know, to cap over five years, we had a lower amount raised by infrastructure funds, about 30% less in 2023 than the previous year. And I puzzled over that a bit, and I started to looking at their figures, and they only invested about $84 billion in P3 type transactions, which is less than they raised. So I think they may have a shortage of really good opportunities. These projects come and go, you know, sometimes last year, the 2022, there were big airport projects at JFK, and that really boosted the U.S. total. But those don't come along every day, you know, the $3, $4, $5 billion projects. I think another thing is that I found very encouraging because I work in transportation policy was that transportation infrastructure was, again, as the previous year, the largest category in the investments shown by InfraLogic data. And it was more than half, 54% was for greenfield projects. So that's a lot of things going on. The biggest transportation investment of 2023 was not a greenfield project. It was the $3 billion brownfield privatization long-term P3 lease of the remaining non-privatized toll roads in Puerto Rico. And that was a win by Abertus, which is the operator of the others as well. So they are now the sole provider in Puerto Rico. But it's a small place, and it's not too surprising, perhaps, that there would be one provider. And finally, in the category of funds globally speaking, highways of the transportation projects, highways were 52% of the investment, and urban rail was second at 34%. And that parallels the previous year as well with highways having the, actually, no, airports, I think, last year, last time, last report, were the biggest category, and then highways. Very interesting. Interesting facts. Bob, let's move on. Another part of your report is greenfield USP3s. And what did you see last year, and what are you looking at this year? I think you say in your report that there are some interesting and good projects to watch this year. Yes. I think we have a bigger pipeline of transportation P3 projects than we've had in several years. First of all, what I think is particularly interesting is that there's a move toward greater use of revenue finance transportation P3s. And for about 10 years, the hot thing in the United States was availability payment P3s. And I think what's happened is that the state legislators and state DOTs have figured out that those projects typically require 30% or 40% direct government support. And there's very small, only about 6% or 8% equity investment, whereas in the revenue-based projects, there's more like 30% to 40% equity in the more recent ones, and very small amount of state funding. And some of the projects are being done with no state funding at all. Tax-exempt federal private activity bonds, for sure. And TIFIA loans, but those are all, you know, the obligation of paying for all of that is the P3 entity, not the state government. So they're increasingly a good deal for state DOTs in terms of their budgets, assuming they have enough of the right kind of projects to find. Interesting. Very interesting. Any projects you're particularly interested in this year that you'll be keeping an eye on? Yes. Well, first, we're going to have financial close within the next month or two, I think, for the Calcasieu River Bridge in Louisiana, which is a replacement of a 70-some-year-old bridge on Interstate 10, and it was only four lanes wide, and it became a bottleneck at certain times of day. And the new bridge will have six lanes and have electronic tolling and so forth. $2.1 billion. There's a big political battle over whether the tolls would be fair. And so they pre-jiggered the terms of the long-term, I think it's a 50-year P3 concession, and the state's putting in a little more, and they're giving some local discounts, but it's still going to be basically a toll-financed replacement bridge. Coming up, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Louisiana all have projects in the pipeline, which are almost all likely to be revenue-risk financed. Georgia DOT is in the procurement process for the SR-400 express toll lanes, adding that to a congested freeway in Atlanta area. And then going on, they're in the final planning stages for about a $10 billion worth of express toll lanes on their ring road, the I-285, again in Atlanta. So they're building towards a whole network. They already have several express toll lanes there. These projects that I just mentioned are their first revenue-risk DBFO entries. So that's another sea change that we're seeing again. Tennessee is doing likewise. They could pass with bipartisan support legislation for what they are cleverly calling choice lanes, meaning express toll lanes, and there will be four projects initially, two in Nashville and one each in two of the other larger metro areas. And they're already zeroing in on the specifics for the first of the projects in Nashville. And I'm not sure what exactly the timing is, but that they may be doing requests for information and perhaps RFPs before the end of this year. North Carolina already has one revenue-financed express toll lanes on I-77 north of Charlotte. They're now in the final stages of deciding whether to do a revenue-risk P3 for the extension southbound from Charlotte to the South Carolina border. And the odds, I'm betting on, they'll do this as another P3 because this is now... I was just at a conference in North Carolina last week, and the price tag for this is now up to $4 billion, so it would be a gigantic hole in the DOT's budget if they had to do that themselves. We also have projects in the planning stages in Louisiana. They have two revenue-risk P3s, including that big bridge. There's another bridge across the Mississippi, a supplemental bridge across the Mississippi River in the Baton Rouge area, the state capital. That's in getting near to the stage where they're gonna have a finalized design concept and so forth. And it's going to be a toll bridge, so it will probably be a P3 as well since they have done two others. And then finally, Illinois legislature passed legislation streamlining their P3 process, which they've never really used for a big project and authorizing the state DOT to go ahead with express toll lanes on I-55, which would be the first toll lanes on any state in Illinois or other nearby Midwestern states as a milestone in itself. And finally, we also had Florida legislation to ease up on how they do unsolicited proposals for P3s and a bill that extends the length of possible terms to 75 years, references revenue risk. Florida has never done a revenue-risk P3. And so if they actually go forward with a project under this new legislation, that would be yet another example of the growth of the revenue-risk model. We seem to be seeing more of those, definitely. One other factor in that is that the government accounting standards board a year or two ago passed a new policy that says availability payments have to be counted on the state balance sheet as liabilities. And that in many states is going to be a restraint on how many of those they can do. Texas and Virginia have never allowed them. And I think North Carolina may have done one, but they expressed some concerns about doing any more of them. So this is another reason why I think we're going to see more of the revenue risk and fewer availability. Places for availability, you can't do a transit project with revenue-based financing. So you need it for that. You need it for some public building things, but I don't think for highway projects, it's going to be very much used anymore. Very interesting. Some interesting things to watch out for this year, definitely. And your report also covers pension fund investment 2023. And why don't you talk about that a little and what may be coming up in that area? It's still a relatively new thing for the United States. Australia and Canada pioneered public pension fund investment in infrastructure, revenue-generating infrastructure, by the way, about 15, 20 years ago, and now have world-class public pension funds that have their own staff, that have the expertise to pick projects to invest in and so forth. In the United States, it started very slowly about a decade ago with the largest pension fund calipers investing in privatized London Gatwick Airport and the Indiana Toll Road long-term P3 brownfield lease. What I've seen in the last few years, particularly based on infrologic reports, is a growing interest and performance of state and local public employee pension funds making allocations to infrastructure funds. I think they've recognized they don't have the kind of expertise that the Australian and Canadian pension funds have. So it's like you and I deciding not to speculate in the stock market, but to buy good solid mutual funds. What they're getting, they're getting a mutual fund in each of the infrastructure funds that they put some money with, and it spreads the risk, gives them a balanced portfolio. And I don't have any comparative year-on-year trends, but I'm hoping by next year's report to be able to have a scale of how much this kind of investment by U.S. pension funds is increasing. Anecdotally, it looks like a strong increasing trend, but we don't really have that documented yet. Definitely something to watch out for, definitely keep an eye out for that. You know, one thing I was thinking of and outside of the report, you know, we have a presidential election coming up. Do you see infrastructure policy or P3s being talked about in the election or the campaign, or is that not going to come up much this year, would you say? My impression, Gene, is that P3s are too esoteric a topic for the voters who will be pitched by the two presidential candidates. I think certainly President Biden has really touted the infrastructure aspects of the things that his administration has done. So I think he will continue to make points on that. And whether former President Trump will decide to have some answers to that remains to be seen. I just don't, I'm not really in a position to speculate. Well, we'll get our crystal ball out for that one, definitely. Well, Bob, thank you so much for your interesting insights and sharing what you learned in the report. We really appreciate it. And it was great to speak to you. And that concludes our Crossroads podcast. And thank you for listening.

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior reporter with InfraLogic, and I'll be speaking with Gary Durden today, partner and managing director with CRCIB, about the tax credit transfer model. Gary provides transaction management and advisory services for clients in the sustainable energy sector, including corporate M&A, capital raises, and structured finance solutions for wind and solar projects. Gary, thanks so much for joining us today. How are you? I'm doing very well, Chuck. Thank you for having me on the program today. Thank you so much for joining us. As some of our listeners may know, the U.S. Treasury Department recently finalized rules that allow recipients of tax credits for things like renewable energy development under the Inflation Reduction Act to sell those credits to third-party investors to use against their tax liability. It's generally referred to as tax credit transferability. As we've reported at InfraLogic, the tax credit market has grown rapidly since a regulatory framework was proposed last year. Gary, for listeners who may not be entirely familiar with tax credit transfers, can you give a brief overview of how the transfer market works and how it's evolving as a source of capital for the renewable energy sector? Sure. Well, you know, it's pretty simple in concept. An owner of a project that generates tax credits can sell those credits to a buyer, which is different than it has been treated historically. Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, only an owner of the project could claim these tax credits. And so project owners typically don't have the tax liabilities that's needed to effectively utilize those credits. So they would have to bring in a partner and then disproportionately allocate items of taxable income and credits to that partner. And the partnerships that they formed were somewhat complicated, and the universe of potential buyers was limited. Now you can simply find a buyer who can sign a purchase and sale agreement and take those credits. The buyer will, you know, for every dollar of tax credit that they get, it reduces their tax liability by a dollar. So they will purchase the credits from a seller at a discount, say 90 cents on the dollar, and then utilize those credits to offset their tax liabilities. Now there's limitations on when the closing of that sale can take place. The sale can't happen any earlier than the year in which the credit is generated, and it can't happen any later than the tax filing date for the seller. A buyer who is credit worthy can provide a commitment to purchase the credits at any time prior to the project being placed in service. And so the seller of the credit can take that commitment and then get a loan against it. It's basically a bridge loan. I would also say that the market is evolving. It's very young right now, but it's rapidly evolving. Some of the things that we're seeing is the buyer universe is expanding. We're seeing more and more buyers come into the market. We're seeing the way in which these transactions are being executed is also evolving. You have bilateral transactions, which here at CRCIB, we mostly deal with, but there are some online exchanges in an attempt to simplify the process. Those are typically for smaller deals, something less than say $5 to $10 million, but that is something that is continuing to evolve. Pricing is evolving. It's mostly driven by supply and demand, and there's some scarcity pricing that's involved, but we're seeing price move as we get through, as the market continues to evolve. And then finally, I'd say the terms under which you're selling these credits is evolving, especially around indemnification provisions related to any callback or recapture of these tax credits. Right. And just to give a sense of how important tax credit transferability is likely to be to the renewable energy sector in the coming years, a lot of people I've spoken with for Infologic have said that without the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act for tax credit transfers, the lion's share of incentive payments for renewable energy and other projects aimed at fighting climate change would be essentially stranded. Is that your view as well? And if so, can you explain why? Yes, I agree with that. And the reason why is, you know, even prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, wind and solar projects were the primary beneficiaries of these federal tax credits, and they struggled, the owners of those projects struggled to find tax equity. It's just a very constrained market. There's a handful of large banks that supply probably 60 to 80% of the total volume of tax equity deals that were done in every year prior to the Inflation Reduction Act being passed. So the market was somewhat limited. And now fast forwarding to today where the Inflation Reduction Act has been passed, it has not only renewed the tax credits for wind and solar projects, but it has expanded the tax credit to cover new technologies that previously did not qualify for the tax credit, such as carbon capture, renewable natural gas, standalone battery storage, and various green fuels that are now eligible for the tax credit. So the market of potential projects that can qualify for tax credits has now been vastly expanded. And in addition to that, you have credits that there's a bonus credit that's available for certain qualifying projects. For example, if it's located in an area, what's called an energy community area or a low income area, it can qualify for bonuses of 10, 20, 30%. So because of that, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to potentially lead to many, many more projects coming online and generating many more federal tax credits. And so the owners of these projects are going to be seeking someone to help them monetize those credits. If we were to rely solely on the pre IRA tax equity market, which was about $20 billion of tax equity per year prior to the IRA, that would be a serious constraint. So opening up transferability brings in the ability to bring in new potential buyers, new participants in this market, and should greatly extend the universe of potential counterparties and therefore allow these projects to get built and come online. Otherwise, there just wouldn't have been a market to finance all of these projects and all of these credits that were made available without transferability would likely have been stranded. So it sounds like the amount of traditional tax equity that was in the market prior to the IRA was already sort of running up against its capacity. And this larger universe of new investors or tax credit buyers was really needed in order for developers of more traditional solar and wind projects, as well as some of these newer technologies to be able to monetize their credits. Is that what you're saying? Yes, I think that's exactly right. Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, there were two technologies that were the primary beneficiaries of these federal tax credits, and that was wind and solar projects. The market was constrained for traditional tax equity. Project owners found it challenging to attract tax equity investors to invest in their projects. There was just too much demand and not enough supply of the tax equity product. Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the tax equity transaction volume each year was somewhere in the range of $18 to $20 billion. And we think that now with the passage of the IRA and the expansion of the availability of these credits to different technologies, as well as the introduction of the bonus tax credits, that the amount of deals that could get done would be double that $20 billion figure in the next couple of years alone, and potentially quadruple before the end of this decade. So without an alternative to traditional tax equity, a lot of those projects simply could not get built because they would not have the financing needed to fund the construction. And I think something that you kind of alluded to in your earlier response is that although tax credit purchases don't require the high level of diligence, expertise, and transaction costs needed to execute a traditional tax equity deal, they're not a completely seamless kind of over-the-counter transaction. Can you talk a little bit about why that is and whether as time goes forward and the market matures, we might expect to see an increase in efficiency over time in these transactions? That is correct. These transactions are not necessarily as seamless as, say, purchasing a company's stock on an exchange. The primary reason for that, and this is related more to the investment tax credit than the production tax credit, and the investment tax credit happens to be at least currently much more prevalent in the market. The primary reason for that is there is some risk that once you claim the investment tax credit, the IRS may come back and challenge you on the amount of the credit that you received. The amount of the credit that you receive is based on the cost to build the project, which can include implied developer fees related to the development work needed to get the project to construction phase and actually built. The IRS has in the past challenged the amount of the developer fees that are imputed to that project and therefore it affects the investment tax credit. There's also potential for the IRS to recapture the ITC. The ITC vests over a five-year period and certain events that may occur during that five-year period could trigger a recapture by the IRS. One simple one is if the project owner sells the project during that five-year period, the unvested portion of the ITC could be recaptured by the IRS. This could also apply to, for example, a foreclosure by a bank. If the bank has a lien on the project and they foreclose and take ownership of the project that is similar to or akin to selling the project. You transferred ownership and that could trigger a recapture. Another example would be there's some catastrophic failure of the project and because of some natural catastrophe, say earthquake or hurricane or violent hailstorm that damages solar panels, and if the project is not rebuilt, then there's some risk that the ITC could be recaptured. There's a lot there. The buyer of these credits has that risk. They're the one who's going to be responsible for the IRS coming back and reducing or recapturing that credit. Before they make their purchase, they are going to have to do some due diligence. You have to make sure that the project can be a viable operating project for that five-year vesting period or recapture period. They're going to want to make sure that they have indemnifications from the buyer against any kind of recapture event. Those indemnifications need to be backstopped by a creditworthy entity, so maybe a parent guarantee. If the parent company is not creditworthy enough, there are insurance products that are available that can enhance the guarantee provided by the seller of the credits. Finally, there are certain financial structuring that you can put in place to allow the project owner to divest their interest in the project and minimize the risk of a recapture event. There's quite a bit of due diligence and structuring that may need to be done in order to effectively mitigate the risks associated with the purchase of the ITC. You said a lot of those risks are more prevalent with projects claiming the investment tax credit. Presumably, if a project sponsor is claiming the production tax credit, which is the other main avenue for claiming these tax credits, there's less risk of an IRS challenge or recapture just because the credit is directly linked to production of either energy or in the case of an alternative technology, say the amount of hydrogen produced or the amount of carbon captured. Is that right? For the production tax credit, the tax risk is lower than the investment tax credit. The risk that the production tax credit is reduced or reclaimed by the IRS is lower, but not zero. There could be challenges, for example, around when the project is considered to have begun construction and therefore whether the project can claim the production tax credit. But given we have a 10-year runway on the PTCs, I don't think that'll be an issue anytime soon. It would become more of an issue as the PTC gets closer to the phase-out date. For PTCs, yeah, lower tax risk. There's production risk, of course. The project may not generate the amount of the required product, the energy or the green hydrogen that was forecasted in the model that was used to close the transaction. But those deals, the PTC purchases are typically structured where a payment comes in a year. You look back at how much was produced and then you determine how many PTCs were produced and then you purchase that. In that sense, the PTC buyer takes on much less risk. The primary challenge with the production tax credit is that the PTCs are earned over a 10-year time horizon. Most owners of projects who are looking to monetize that PTC stream will want to have someone who can provide a long-term commitment to purchase those PTCs over that full 10 years. The universe of buyers who can actually do that is quite a bit smaller than the universe of buyers who can purchase a tax credit that they have some degree of certainty will be earned in the next year or maybe two years. That certainly makes sense. One thing I'm also hearing a lot about is what's been described to me as a hybrid structure for tax credit transactions, where a tax equity investor will enter into a traditional tax equity partnership with a project sponsor with the presumption from the outset of the deal that the tax equity investor will eventually sell a significant portion of the tax credits that they're eligible to through a deal with a third party. Can you tell us a little bit about the role hybrid deals have played in the transfer market so far? Yes. Actually, hybrid deals are becoming much more prevalent, especially among the larger, more traditional tax equity banks. Those banks, those institutions like the hybrid approach because they all have limited tax liabilities. Those tax liabilities may be large, but they are finite. There's really only so many tax credits they can monetize, so much accelerated depreciation that they can utilize before they run out of capacity. That limits the number of deals they can do. These banks are very relationship driven. That means that they're saying no, oftentimes, to clients that they view as being very important. They want to make those clients happy or those customers happy. By selling, by being able to close a traditional tax equity transaction, but have the option of selling a portion of those credits to some other party, these banks are able to stretch their limited tax capacity and appetite across more deals, more clients, and therefore, being a better counterparty to their important client base. Now, there is still a universe of smaller, less traditional tax equity investors who have been active prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. These investors, from what I've seen so far at least, they're less interested in the hybrid structure. They like just doing regular tax equity deals. This is partly because they have more limited tax appetite, more limited tax liabilities. They're interested in just doing a deal, reducing their tax liabilities, and then moving on. They're not very relationship focused. They're more transaction focused, and so less of a need to really try to do more deals. For them, doing a deal is more of a distraction than a main business line. I would make that distinction, but among the large tax equity investors, yes, I think the hybrid structure is becoming more and more prevalent. Now, sponsors like hybrid deals because, A, it increases the supply of the tax equity product so more deals can get done. They also like the hybrid deal versus the alternative of just doing a transfer, a simple transfer deal. The hybrid tax equity deal has really two advantages. One, the tax equity investor, while they're selling some or all of the tax credits, they're still taking the accelerated depreciation and monetizing that for their sponsor. There's some economic benefit there that you would lose by just selling the tax credit. The other advantage, again, for investment tax credit projects is that by forming a partnership with a tax equity investor, you can effectuate a step up in the taxable basis and therefore the ITC eligible basis. By doing that, you can increase the amount of the ITC and that resulting in better economics for the sponsor. I would say that in addition to the hybrid tax equity structure, we are also seeing a similar market develop among investors who are not tax focused. They're more of a cash driven or cash focused investors, oftentimes developing a preferred equity product that they can use to form a partnership with a project owner to effectuate a step up in basis and therefore increase the ITC amount. They're not taking a disproportionate share of accelerated depreciation, so their sponsor is missing the benefit of that economics, but it does allow the sponsor to get a step up in basis and therefore increase the ITC amount, which again is an advantage over just selling the ITC to an interested buyer. We are seeing a growth in that market as well. So there's really, I'd say, three different routes that a project owner can use to monetize their benefits. They can go hybrid tax equity route, they can go straight transfer deal, or they can use and utilize a preferred equity investor to help them get a step up in basis and sell the credits to another party after that. And just to clarify for listeners who may not be as deeply embedded in this space, when you refer to a step up in basis, that refers to the fact that the tax credits are based on the valuation of a project rather than the amount of money that's necessarily invested in the project by the developer. And so in order to get that step up to the book value of the project, you need to have a transaction to place that valuation on the project. Is that right? Yes, that's exactly right. The investment tax credit or ITC is based on the value of the project. And without having a third party transaction take place, without having some type of a sale transaction take place, you're not able to effectuate that step up or have a basis for that step up in value. And so it's important to have some type of transaction take place, even if you're selling just a minority stake in the project, you need some type of transaction to allow that increase in value and therefore increase in the ITC. For the production tax credit, this is a non-issue. Production tax credits are just based on the amount of product that the project generates. And so this formation of a partnership is of less interest to a PTC project owner than an ITC project owner. Right. And going back to what you were saying about sort of the larger traditional tax equity investors really liking these hybrid deals, that makes sense to me. They're able to sort of benefit from their expertise in this space, but then spin off these tax credits and kind of replenish their tax capacity to go on and do more deals. From the project side, are the hybrid deals predominantly being utilized by larger project sponsors, larger portfolios of projects, or are smaller developers able to get in on this sort of deal as well? Yes. So for the tax equity hybrid deals where your counterparty is a large traditional tax equity investor, I would say that you're still more likely, those counterparties are more likely to do a transaction with a larger, more well-established sponsor who has a good track record and a strong pipeline. Because of their product that they offer, their experience in underwriting these transactions and doing these investments, they just have the track record, the credibility to get deals done and they can be somewhat more picky and choosy about with whom they choose to do business. But smaller developers with less of a track record do have the ability to do partnerships with preferred equity investors. The preferred equity investor market, I think is small, but it's growing. And with more participants coming into the market, there's more competition to find sponsors with whom to do deals. And so there may be more opportunity to do these transactions. Also, the larger investors tend to prefer to do larger deals. They like putting their capital to work in large volumes. And for them, it's more bang for the buck, right? They have the same size team, they can put more dollars out the door with larger deals. But for these preferred equity investors, they may have an appetite for smaller check sizes and therefore smaller projects, smaller developers can get their attention. And I guess I would add that one of the constraints that historically has plagued or been a problem for smaller developers is they may not have a strong balance sheet. And tax equity investors historically have looked to do deals with sponsors who can have the credit worthiness to stand behind indemnity obligations. And so what we've seen in the market over the last, I don't know, two to three years is that the tax insurance market has really grown quite a bit. And so these tax insurance products can be a very effective enhancement to the credit quality of a sponsor that may not have as strong a balance sheet as would be needed to attract tax equity. So that has been another development that has helped the smaller or the newer developers and project owners in the U.S. And you mentioned that this is already a rapidly growing market. I think you laid out pretty well, you know, how strong the growth drivers are with this influx of tax credit money from the Inflation Reduction Act with the finalization of the rules for tax credit transferability just recently coming through. Does that affect the market going forward, do you think, or was the momentum behind the market kind of baked in from the proposed rules last year? I don't think that the final rules had anything that was a big surprise to the market. And based on my own experience, I'm not aware of any participants in the market who were holding off or delaying closing a transaction to wait for the results of this, of the final rules. I wouldn't expect any material impact of the final rules, either positive or negative, just because we were seeing plenty of deals get done and no one was voicing any concerns about what would be in those final rules and there were no surprises. And going back to what you were saying earlier about traditionally these tax credits really only being available for solar and wind and a major change coming through the IRA in the variety of projects that are eligible for tax credits. It sounds like so far, wind and solar projects have accounted for the majority of these tax credit transfer transactions with the availability of credits for emerging markets beginning to get established. Can you talk a little bit about how those markets are evolving and what you're seeing there? Yes, sure. I think that wind, solar, and I would add standalone battery storage to that mix as well. These three technologies have been more prevalent in the market for tax credit transactions, whether tax equity or transferability. But I'd say that's really because two reasons. One, there are just a lot more wind and solar and battery storage projects that are being built right now than there are for some of the more emerging technologies. And so there's more opportunity to get a deal done. And then the second reason is naturally any technology that is emerging is inherently newer and people look at it, potential investors may look at it as being more risky or at least less well understood, less well established. And so it may take some time for the market to figure out what are the challenges associated with that particular technology and how do you mitigate those challenges? Are there certain structures you can use? Are there certain due diligence points that need to be hit upon? It could take some time for those technologies to really hit their stride, but we're already seeing deals getting done. It's a little slower start for some of the newer technologies. So for example, we've seen renewable natural gas deals get done with transferability. We're working on carbon capture deals. We saw one get announced a few weeks ago. So those technologies are certainly, they're progressing and they will become very big consumers of or sellers of the tax credits in the next couple of years. That will be very interesting to watch for. Lastly, I wonder if you can share with us what market or regulatory developments you'll be watching for in this space as you advise clients in the renewable energy sector. The one that tends to come up most often in my discussions with clients and counterparties is just, this is an election year. And so the presidential election, the congressional elections that occur later this year, what impact will that have on the energy sector, the renewable energy sector? There's some concern that there could be partial or more repeal parts or all of the Inflation Reduction Act. That's a question we get quite a bit. I suppose that no one can see the future, of course, but we think that's a relatively low likelihood that there's any material change to the Inflation Reduction Act. We see the IRA as benefiting projects and owners that are located across the country, including in red states. And so it would be, I think politicians would be careful about enacting any kind of legislation that could negatively impact those projects and those project owners. It's a fairly low likelihood that we see anything material happening there. Another, well, I guess to add to that point, in addition to the Inflation Reduction Act, there's an awful lot of support for the renewable energy space, even outside of the federal government. There's a lot of state policies that are in place. There's a lot of private companies have ESG mandates that they're striving to deliver on to the promises that they've made to their stakeholders. So even in the face of a change to the Inflation Reduction Act, which we think is a low probability, we think that there is a very strong future for renewable energy growth in the US. And then I guess I'll just say one other thing that we're looking at is possible three regulations, which could increase the capital requirements for large banks, for tax equity investments from large banks. If those proposals were to become law, then it would become essentially prohibitively expensive for large banks to provide tax equity product. If that were to occur, and I think the industry is confident that there will be a fix to those proposals, but if it were to occur, we would see a shift away from tax equity partnerships from large banks and much more deal flow getting done through a straight transferability and with alternative providers than the traditional tax equity banks. So smaller banks or other non-financial companies who can still provide the tax equity product and wouldn't be subject to the stringent capital requirements. Well, yeah, we're certainly watching closely for a resolution on Basel III. And I'm sure many of our listeners are going to be joining you and me in watching closely for the election outcomes this November. Gary Durden, thank you so much for joining us. It was great talking with you about all these issues. I appreciate you coming on the podcast. Thank you for inviting me. This was a real pleasure. Thanks a lot. It was great having you on.

I'm Infrologics Managing Editor for the Americas, Jonathan Carmody, and I'm delighted to welcome to the studio today, Emil Henry, founder and CEO of Tiger Infrastructure Partners. Emil, welcome to the show. Thank you. It's great to be here. Good to see you again. See you too. Tiger Infrastructure Partners was founded in 2010. They have three funds to date and have raised successful capital and deployed across many different sectors in the industry. The fund focus on three areas, digital infrastructure, energy transition, and transportation assets. So Emil, tell us a little bit about the strategy and the ethos of Tiger Infrastructure Partners when it comes to middle market investing. Tiger, we have been called a pioneer. We've been called innovative, and I think the main reason for that is that we were the first growth infrastructure fund complex in the infrastructure firmament. All of my investors know the original insight for Tiger came from this. My senior partners and I were Lehman Brothers when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, and we decided to spin out to start our own firm. But in doing that, you know, God closes one door, he opens another door. We had the opportunity really to look at infrastructure investing as a white canvas and what might we do. And the original thesis for Tiger was that there was this wide open, massive addressable market which none of the infrastructure players were addressing. And suffice to say that it is growth and value add and higher return than what it existed at the time. And we knew this to be the case, but the world had yet to embrace, this is back in 2010-11, the world had yet to embrace growth infrastructure. Actually my partners and I, we were a little tortured up at the time in, you know, what do we call it? Because there was no growth fund, LPs had heard of such a beast. And we thought we might confuse them if we went out of it with something called growth. At the end of the day, we looked at ourselves and we said, you know what, let's call it what it is. It is growth. It's incredibly exciting. And let's go after it, calling it growth. Emil, you founded Tiger Infrastructure Partners in 2010, very much with a growth mentality or a growth ethos. Perhaps you could talk a little bit about the concept of a growth investor and how that plays out in the middle market space. Yes, thank you for asking that. Yes, my partners and I were investing in global infrastructure at Lehman Brothers at the time of the financial crisis. And that was the original impetus to start Tiger Infrastructure. But to your question, the original insight for Tiger went like this, and it is what I articulated to my very first investor. And it was this, I want to spin out with my senior team and we have an extraordinary opportunity. And to oversimplify that opportunity, imagine a white canvas and to paint the white canvas at the time, this is around 2010, let's call it. At the time, 90 to 95% of the capital in the infrastructure space was dedicated towards core and core plus. It's not far off that today, by the way, but it's less than that. But what I said was, there appears a tiny little area of infrastructure, which happens to be a massive opportunity like I've never seen in any asset class before, potentially dwarfing private equity. And it is a growth. And further, there are no sophisticated, institutionally backed private equity firms that are driving hard after it. I want to be the first. And that was the first thesis. The second thesis was and still is that, and when I was asked, what makes you think you can capture this opportunity of newer growth infrastructure? And I said, it's very simple, because every free market economy for the last 100 years has created tailwinds for whether by innovation or by regulation. Those are really the drivers, either by innovation or regulation have driven the need for new infrastructure. And just to give you an example, looking back over the last number of decades of these free market economies, always creating tailwinds by innovation or regulation, in the 1970s, there was the deregulation of the airline industry and the advent of environmental legislation. In the 1980s, there was deregulation of railway and trucking. That was, by the way, when computing was being kickstarted. In the 1990s, personal computers become ubiquitous. And hey, there's something called the internet. Talk about innovation, changing the need for new infrastructure. In 2000s, of course, there was the commercialization of the internet. In the 2010s, the Paris Agreement has driven a lot of the global net zero mind space and emission targets that's driving the need for new infrastructure. And of course, lately in the 2020s, you've got all this legislation from the Biden administration, the BEAT Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Act. My point is that it's always present and there always will be new infrastructure. And the last point that I would make around this is infrastructure as an asset class, it came about unlike any asset class I've ever seen in my decades of being an investment professional. And that is this, it was not driven by real opportunity initially, by real opportunity in the real economy. It was driven by big investors who were looking for an investment product. Let's call this as the early 2000s and mid 2000s. They historically low interest rates, zero interest rates, searching for yield, looking for bond substitutes, and they found it in roads, bridges, and tunnels. And sit on it for 20 years and collect a 7% coupon or something like that. And that was the driver of the space. It wasn't energy transition. It wasn't the digital transformation. But that is, back to your original question, it was, that is what we were aiming for, those opportunities driven by those phenomenon in the real economy. Fantastic. That's a very clear description of how you work at Tiger. And when you talked about the kind of assets of tomorrow and the blue chip companies that you're working with, I really found it very interesting when I was doing my homework ahead of this interview to check in on the portfolio, see the kind of companies that you've been investing in. You know, you've got a very interesting mix of companies in the portfolio. The FBO business, Modern Aviation, which you recently sold a stake to Apollo, the battery storage and renewables business, Zenobi, you sold a stake to KKR, I believe it was. And the deals as well that you've now done with Summit Carbon Solutions for the carbon capture and storage project up in the kind of the Midwest of America. Talk a little bit about how you're attracting those big players, those big infrastructure players into the investments. Of what stage do they join you on that journey investing? We like growth equity writ large, not just infrastructure, but growth equity in the private equity firmament. We are most typically the first institutional capital in. You'd see that in classic private equity. That is the same for us. The main difference between us and private equity growth equity is, A, we're looking for infrastructure assets, but B, we're not clubbing up deals as a minority investor with other growth investors. We are control investors. And as an infrastructure investor, especially when you're creating something from scratch or expanding something, you want to be in control. We are the first institutional capital in. And as I said, our goal is to create world-class blue ship core assets that large asset owners want to own. But directly to your question, and we've sold virtually all of our exits have been to very, very large asset owners, just as you have articulated. I think part of the reason that they have been so comfortable owning our assets is first, we're very credible people. We've been around for decades. They know us and trust us. All that is very good, but in everything we do, there is typically, even when we sell at the time we go to exit, there is a still a massive addressable market. There is a big open field. So for example, you mentioned Zenobi. That was a battery storage company that we started in, that we invested in five or six years ago. We were the first infrastructure fund to build a world scale battery storage company. That's a theme you see in much of what we do. And part of the reason that we took it from just tiny little business in the UK to being a global business, but even in taking a global and even in helping it grow, what KKR undoubtedly saw was a still a massive addressable market. So that's part of what we do, what we're looking for. It's part of our special sauce is we are looking for these big, wide open, big addressable markets with big tailwinds that even an exit are still going to exist and provide the next asset owner comfort that they have an avenue to further growth, de-risk, less of a complex situation that they take over, but they are indeed looking for that growth. Another quick example, modern aviation. I love to talk about modern aviation because as your listeners will know, Blackstone and GIP, they own the largest collection of, of FBOs in the United States, KKR under the brand name signature. KKR owns the second largest collection of FBOs in the United States under the brand name Atlantic. We came in with nothing except an idea and a team and an understanding that the FBO space was what was largely fragmented. We saw addressable market of 500 to 700 FBOs, there might be a couple thousand, but still only five or 700 that you'd want. And signature and Atlantic had kind of cooled their acquisition binge and we saw the opportunity to be a consolidator. And so we dove in with a world-class team and we built a, what is either the third or largest in the country, which we were still an investor in, but we have exited a large portion of that. But again, that with Apollo, what Apollo, undoubtedly one of the things they saw is still just a big opportunity to continue to go after FBOs. I think that's quite unique about your approach as well, isn't it, Emil at Tiger, when you're actually staying in these investments, you remain as a co-investor alongside people like Apollo and KKR. You also want to participate in the growth and the future success of these businesses. And I wanted to ask you, taking a step back before that, how do you work in the origination stage of these deals? How does your team operate? Traditionally, you've invested across North America and Europe. I think with FSBO Energia, you've also got now an investment in Brazil, which is my old stomping ground in Latin America. So very happy to see that. How do you go about origination and which areas do you look for typically to find opportunity? Glad you asked that, because that is certainly part of what we think of as our special sauce. Again, we were the first growth infrastructure fund. We haven't seen another growth infrastructure fund, though some now are doing things similar to us or trying to do things similar to us. But my point is that by virtue of being a growth fund, and this, by the way, this was an unintended consequence of me starting this fund complex, is that we are known and now we are known and have been known as the growth investor in infrastructure, which means that we are getting from all of the financial intermediaries, all entrepreneurs and innovators, we are getting amongst many other deal folks, we are getting early stage windows into the infrastructure of tomorrow. And 95% of it is worthless and we wouldn't touch it, right? Most of it, much of it is just too early stage, too risky, all that kind of stuff. However, by being the growth guy, you attract these growth plans and those growth plans are your window into where the world is headed. So for example, when my partners and I started Tiger Infrastructure, EV charging wasn't on the agenda. However, very quickly we began to see these plans. It was the wild west. There was no, this is way back. There was nothing of institutional quality. However, we knew there was going to be something very interesting in that. And so what we do, to your point about origination, is that once we develop conviction around a new pathway, a new vertical, a new opportunity, we deploy teams to go very deep and do very extensive research on these. And we're doing them literally right now on five or six areas. I'm happy to talk about them, but it is that deep work, which informs us like in battery storage. Battery storage wasn't on the original radar screen. However, we began to see early plans for three years. We studied it and we finally executed with Zenobi, but that's an important, that kind of seeing, getting a glimpse of the future, deploying teams against that thesis, whether sometimes we shelve it because we decide it's not worth pursuing. That's a part of our origination machine. And we have in our world, since we're first institutional capital in, quite often the sellers, they're looking for primary capital. They're not looking for something to sell, right? They're looking, which means they're looking for a partner. They're not auctioning something. They're looking who's a partner who really understands how to manage growth, who has done it before. We have a real, I can say this comfortably. My partners in my firm, we have real skill set expertise in having done this for over a decade. Yes, this is not for people to jump in and kind of try to do it. I always make that point when I talk to people. That's a part of our origination machine. Excellent. I can imagine you as a kind of middle market infrastructure shark tank or something like this, auditioning all of these companies coming through the door. Which is not to say, and sometimes I do have to say this, which is not to say that we are not venture capitalists. We are not about VC risk, A. We're not about taking technology risk. We are about really limited commodity risk. In everything we do, we're not looking to find a business plan that has the quote unquote characteristics of infrastructure. And so maybe we can fit it into our portfolio. No, we're looking for infrastructure. We're looking for essential services, real assets with high and defensible modes, inflation protected in everything we do. We're trying to stay true to an infrastructure mandate. And our investors pretty much expect that. And in terms of your mandate, looking through some of the documents that we have on our Infologic database, I saw some reports about some of the performance of Tiger's funds. And I think you're producing somewhere around mid-teens, net IRRs for the business. You also have quite an interesting strategy with co-investments, I believe. A lot of the LPs can co-invest alongside, outside of the fund structure. Can you tell me a little bit about that and also about the capital structure in the stack that you like to implement with the businesses? I think when we spoke before, Emil, you said that you don't like to over-leverage the assets too much. So maybe you could talk a little bit about those elements of the transactions and how that fits into the growth strategy. Yes, leverage is anathema to a growth strategy. If you were sitting across, not from me, but to a fellow who ran a growth equity PE complex, you wouldn't expect them to have a lot of leverage in their program. And we don't either. I think writ large across all of our portfolio companies, if you added them up, we'd be 20% LTV, something like that. It is leverage is not a driver of return for growth. And the corollary to that is that solvency is not one of our top three risks, right? A core infrastructure buyer is going to lever something up 70%, 80%, 90%. They take purchase price risk. They take leverage risk. It's all fine. It's just not what we do. The leverage, to your point, how we think about debt. And to your question about co-investment, yeah, co-investment is a very important piece of our puzzle. And I think of roughly a third of our AUM today is via a co-investment. And that is because with a growth strategy, really what you want to do, if you're going to lead from strength, if you're going to be the strongest partner to a potential entrepreneur, you want to be able to tell them that you can fund their entire business plan. So they don't think, oh, I'm just raising a little bit of capital now, but I got to be in capital formation mode a year from now. They really want to hear you can fund their, typically, typically they want it, that you can fund their business plan. And so we like to do that, or we like to be able to articulate that. And co-investment is a piece of that puzzle of us leading with strength. I'd love to talk a little bit about Summit Carbon Solutions now. It's such an interesting space. Everybody's talking about energy transition, which is a key part of your investment thesis at Tiger. How does carbon capture storage work in this business? I think they're operating out of the Dakotas, is that correct? And Montana? Not Montana, but here, I'll walk you through it. So I'm glad you asked that question because it is fascinating. And again, I mentioned that the theme that you will see is that quite often we are the first in terms of heading into a new sub-vertical. And I believe that we are a first here in that we are backing a team that is building the largest carbon capture and sequestration pipeline in the world. And that is a function, again, of our origination strategy, where years prior we saw the need for carbon capture and sequestration. One of our theses behind this is the following, and it really is powerful. One of the largest consulting firms in the world has advised us that in order for the US to hit its Paris Accord goals, that 30 to 40% of the carbon reduction must come from carbon capture. And the world is just warming up on this. So this is, again, this is like everything we do. There is a massive addressable market here. And even if this large consulting firm is wrong by half, it's just kind of breathtaking what will happen in terms of carbon and sequestration. So that's really the big tailwind behind what we're doing. The second big tailwind is that there has been a longstanding government subsidy, if you will, that allows for, that will pay you for a ton of CO2 sequestered. And that actually, that subsidy was actually enhanced through the recent round of legislation out of Congress in the last couple of years. And that's a subsidy that we think is rock solid and where there is massive bipartisan support on a go forward basis. That's what we're doing there. It is the first. It is hand on heart. It is innovative. We will sell this eventually to a very large asset owner. And there will be many, many more of these to come. How big is the project, Emil? I've seen figures cited well over a billion dollars for this investment when the Greenfield infrastructure. I understand that Summit also had some investment from TPG Rise, Climate Continental Resources and SK, Korean Conglomerate. How big is the project and what's the timeline for construction and for development and all the rest? Yes. Well, the project in its infancy, when we created this company, we and another group called Summit Ag out of Iowa, some very enormously capable investors and with whom we have invested before quite successfully, we created the company before we brought in all those investors that you articulated. Yeah, you're right. We brought in all of those investors and we brought them in to the tune of a little over a billion dollars. So you're right about that in terms of equity. But in terms of the project size, the original size of the project was around five or six billion dollars, but it's been expanded. And the reason it's been expanded is that the folks over at BlackRock were at one point considering building something similar. It's different, but it's similar. And they were considering building a project that they decided not to do. There's many, many reasons for that. It's not worth going into. But the good news for us is that their largest customers on that pipeline immediately or very quickly came over to us. And so by virtue of those new customers, we've expanded the size of the project. We've expanded the volume and the additional volumes are more creative on a gross margin basis just by virtue of economics. That's the size of the project. There are a couple of permits that are left to be had. I believe 70 to 75 percent of the rights of way are done. In many jurisdictions, you can get to those levels and then there's this thing called eminent domain where you can get the rest. And that is well underway. And all the sum and substance of all of that is we should be, their current expectation is that this will be ready for service no later than 2027, maybe 26. All right. We look forward to seeing it. It's another kind of technology that, again, is at the forefront of the energy transition. As you said, it's certainly something that you're pioneering in this sense. I'd like to think about some of the other opportunities that are maybe not ready for prime time. What else is your team investigating? What do you think, Emil, will be the infrastructure that perhaps we're going to be seeing five years from now that is still in its infancy at this stage? OK, great. I'm really glad you asked that question because that's where we live and breathe. We believe we have a window into the next wave. We have teams studying these kinds of things. We're deep into various potential investments that could exploit these trends. And so I need to be kind of careful because it's a little bit of our special sauce here. But just to give you a flavor, sustainable air fuel is a massive market opportunity. I think there's 100 billion gallons of fuel that's used annually. I think less than half percent of that is made up by sustainable air fuel. There's massive demand from basically all the large carriers who see where the world is headed and want a source of SAF, sustainable air fuel. And we have been studying this for a while. We've been working with some people for a while. And we feel we have a bead on the key elements of creating a project like this. And the key elements, it's really threefold. Again, it's not recreating the wheel. It's like every project in history. There's feedstock, there's the actual plant, and there's offtake. And we feel like we have a strong conviction around each of those pieces of the puzzle. Another kind of looking into the future, it's hard to overstate the impact that AI is having on the digital space most, and will have, literally, it's just in the first inning, and will have, especially in and around data centers. And it's, as you probably know well, it's going to be a driver of real innovation around cooling, around the reconfiguration of data centers, and around the source and reliability of power. And there, it's kind of actually, it's mind-boggling what is going on in the space. And when the world goes from CPUs to GPUs, these things that NVIDIA is creating, that's going to change things dramatically. The big hyperscalers, the, you know, the Facebooks, Amazons, Apples, Microsofts, they, amongst others, Apple, amongst others, they are hungry to secure reliability of power. Many of them are negotiating, not only building dozens of data centers globally, but negotiating for power in ways you've never heard of before. I think 4% of US power is used to power data centers or similar activity today. That is going to go up dramatically. It has massive implications for the grid. It has massive implications for grid reliability. And so it's just hard, this is my long-winded way of saying it's just hard to overstate the change. And the punchline there is the data center space is being re-rated as we speak. I don't know where it will end up. I don't know where valuations will end up, but it is, there should be some dramatic impact here and we're deep into it. One last, I'm just trying to give you a flavor, on a global basis, I've said this to others and it's a pretty profound statement and it sounds profound, but it really is the truth. None of the targets that people are aiming for electric vehicles are going to be hit. Not at the sovereign level, not at the state level, they're just not going to be hit. There's many, many, many reasons. You've actually seen some slowdown in growth of demand recently. It's not really that, but that's a thing. It's about the world right now is just short in a profound and substantial way, the critical minerals necessary to achieve those targets. And whether it's copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, kind of the list goes on. Now, some of the recent legislation out of the Biden administration has attempted to create subsidies that incentivize the on-shoring of critical minerals, the development of critical minerals and my point in saying all this is, you know, you ask what's coming, that's definitely coming. Now, as an infrastructure player, we're not on the value chain of critical minerals, which go from mining on the one hand, all the way to manufacturing batteries on the other. We're not going to do either of those. We're not going to be mining. We're not going to be manufacturing batteries, but the supply chain distribution. Think of the analogy of midstream for critical minerals, right? There is an opportunity. We are spending a lot of time on that. That's interesting. And that's something that somebody described to me once as logistics 2.0. I was at a presentation when they talked about how modern day warehouses don't have the right weight bearing capabilities for sophisticated robotic infrastructure. A lot of the rooftops are not necessarily strong enough to hold solar panels and other installations that you might need for that kind of future logistics or logistics 2.0. So that's something that's definitely very high on our list of priorities of sectors that we're seeing investors engage with. Indeed. Look for the decarbonization of virtually everything. If you look out at a modern airport and look at all the trucks going around, the fueling vehicles, the catering vehicles, fast forward 10 years and you've got a massively electrified group of rolling stock and transportation assets. Again, just another in this big opportunity set. Emil, looking forward in another sense, you mentioned the Biden administration and the legislation that they put into place in the last few years. Some of your projects, I'm sure, and some of your companies will benefit from some of that legislation, like perhaps the summit carbon solutions bending from the 45Q tax credits. I'm interested, given your previous position with the treasury, you were the deputy secretary of the treasury from 2005 to 2007, working under Secretary Snowe and Paulson. You must have an interesting perspective now being back in the private sector, having had that public sector experience. Without going into too much detail on the election itself coming up in November, how do you see the macroeconomic situation today? And I'm particularly interested with a view to the election, how you think that the infrastructure related legislation we've seen under the Biden administration is going to play with electors ahead of the November election? Thank you for asking that. Yeah, actually. And a little side note is I spent my career in and around private equity and I was a general before I went into the treasury, I was largely a generalist. But then 2005, this is going on 20 years ago, just by a complete coincidence, I was given an oversight responsibility for something called the US Office of Critical Infrastructure, which is and was a massive investment in US infrastructure in remarkable ways, mostly around security as a response to September 11th. How do we secure where there once was, where the world woke up that there could be a low-cost, high-concept attack that could do such damage? What does that mean for the grid? What does it mean for pipelines? What does it mean for ports? What does it mean for financial infrastructure, right? And so that's really where the light bulb went off for me about the growth opportunity. That's the origins of how I came into the space nearly 20 years ago. And to your point on the macro, you asked two questions, one on the macro issue, one on the impact of infrastructure-related legislation, how it might impact the election. And we don't have a lot of time and you said not a lot of detail, but I'll say this, it's the most complex macro picture I've ever seen in my professional life. And it is not only because of global chaos, it is not only because of global energy transition and energy insecurity and energy volatility. It is not only because there are forces at play that would love to see the dollar no longer as the world's reserve currency, talk about something that's really destabilized. I don't see that in the near term, but let's just be eyes wide open to the fact that there are folks who would really like to see that. And then you get into the kind of global currency and interest rate environment, right? You throw in inflation, you throw in the global monetary policy folks' reaction to that, most namely the Fed. They're really complex. Like, for example, I've never seen the yield curve inverted. I think it was a couple of years ago, 90%. This happened, by the way, when I was at the Treasury. I think it was, yeah, it was before the Great Recession, yield curve inverted. We studied it with the Federal Reserve, with the chairman on down. I think 90% of inverted yield curves in the history of this country have resulted in recessions. For a bunch of reasons which are not worth going into now, yield curve inverted and 90% of the financial community thought the U.S. was going to head into a recession. Obviously, the opinions have changed right now. There's still a small group, including Jamie Dimon over JP Morgan. He still sees a recession. My point is, talk about uncertainty in how people are seeing our economic world right now. It's just really complex and it's really uncertain. In terms of the election, I don't think, in terms of all the legislation, by the way, that legislation has been a piece of the inflation puzzle. That was, if you take a giant step back, there was a lot of industrial policy going on there and, whether you agree with the policy or not, trillions of dollars are being poured into such industrial policy and that's on the backs of trillions of dollars of pandemic cash that got poured. Talk about market distortion and complexity, that's a big piece of the driver of the complexity. But punchline, not to oversimplify it, I don't see that legislation as really impacting the election significantly. I don't think it hits people so much in their day-to-day lives. Yes, price of gas has been really high. Yes, you go to California and you see the cost of electricity as significantly above the rest of the country. But I don't think the folks in California are saying, golly, all those renewable subsidies are making me pay more in my monthly bills. It's kind of the opposite for California. So I just think there are bigger issues at play in this election than the 45Q for carbon and for rural fiber subsidies, which we're trying to exploit for our investors, and further renewable subsidies and critical mineral subsidies. I just don't think they hit people where they live. That might not swing the needle for Joe Public. I don't think so. I could go on chapter and verse about what I think will swing the needle, move the needle, but I really don't think that will. Okay. Excellent. Well, that could be a whole new podcast, so we'll have to invite you back, Emil, for another episode. But I thought this was a very insightful discussion. I thought it was really interesting to hear about Tiger's philosophy and Tiger's strategy in the investments that you're making. So without any further ado, thank you very much for attending Crossroads, Emil, and we look forward to hearing from you again soon. Thank you, Jonathan. It's been a pleasure to be with you. And thank you to all our listeners. I'm Jonathan Carmody, America's Managing Editor at Infralogic. Thank you, everyone, for listening. You can download this episode anywhere you get your podcasts.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, the News Editor of Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest today is Don Dimitrovich, the Senior Managing Director and Portfolio Manager for Energy Infrastructure Credit at Nuveen. Don, thank you for joining Crossroads. Andrew, it's great to be here. Thanks for the invitation. So Don, most of my listeners are probably familiar with Nuveen. But for those who aren't, can you talk a little bit about your firm and where it fits in the infrastructure and energy sector? Andrew, so Nuveen is an asset manager. We manage approximately $1.2 trillion in assets. And in infrastructure, Nuveen's had a long and storied history, having invested in the space for close to 40 years. In total, Nuveen private infrastructure, as an asset class across debt and equity strategies, we manage over $30 billion in capital. And I joined Nuveen approximately a year and a half ago to build a broad-based energy and power credit-focused strategy. And Don, where were you before joining Nuveen and what's your background in this industry? So I've been involved in energy and power, broadly speaking, for the last quarter century. First, my educational background is I'm a chemical engineer, worked as a product development engineer in industry, and then practiced law for a few years before joining Citigroup on the principal investing side. And there I ultimately oversaw an energy and power credit strategy, investing across both sustainable energy and in traditional energy. And then ultimately went on to found an energy and power vertical at a firm called Highbridge, which ultimately spun off into the fund, HPS Investment Partners, and was there for about a decade, where we invested close to $10 billion before I left to join Nuveen. So you've seen a lot of changes and evolution in the energy markets over your time in the sector. Yes. No question. It's been interesting. So over the last 25 years, we first started investing in part of the energy transition in onshore wind, and obviously saw the proliferation of that for a number of years. And then, you know, the continuation of that theme with solar projects and the proliferation of solar as a renewable generation strategy. And more recently, we've witnessed energy storage really coming to life over the last several years. So Don, before this call, I reread an article or white paper that you published a couple months ago called The Solar Coaster, which, by the way, is a catchy name, and it's about some of the challenges that the renewable industry is facing. And while these headwinds probably won't be news to anyone who's followed the industry, like increased cost of capital, supply chain issues, I think our listeners would be interested in hearing just how these trends have impacted the sector in your view and in the view of your firm. Sure, Andrew. Happy to speak to that. I think the overarching theme of seeing the growth in renewable generation over the last several years, I think that is continuing, and we're seeing the resurgence of renewable generation across whether it's wind, solar, and obviously complementary asset classes like energy storage. So I think from a macro perspective, and if you take a look at just the stats around the growth in renewable generation, that all continues and is fairly pronounced. I think the thing we wanted to note was while you've got this macro backdrop that's quite constructive and obviously facilitated by legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act here in the U.S., at the same time, there are some headwinds that are delaying projects. And you touched on a couple of key themes that I think are incredibly important. Cost of capital and the elevated rate environment that we're currently experiencing has a pronounced impact on renewable generation projects because of their capital intensity. A significant portion of the cost of those projects is really reliant on having access to low-cost capital, and as rates have gone up, it's challenged some of these projects. So that's one headwind. Two, the supply chain disruptions that started in COVID and frankly are continuing in the sector are something certainly project developers are acutely aware of, and it's placing significant pressure on project development. And obviously, as there's a need for increased power, the delay in some of these projects is compounding some of the challenges we're seeing with grid stability. And then when you factor in inflation and labor costs, that's another headwind that developers are feeling. And as we look to ultimately investing in these projects, it's something we're focused on to make sure that the project, all the cost contingencies take that into account. And it seems like we're not hearing as much about supply chain issues as we were two years ago, but it is still a concern. Where does that stand from your view? Has it gotten better? Is it in the right direction or is it just something that the industry has gotten used to? It's a great question. I think certainly in some instances, we're seeing that some of the supply chain issues that were really part of COVID have actually waned away a bit. But in other instances, such as transformers and breakers, the delays that we were experiencing back then, I think continue. And in some instances, we're actually seeing it become more acute. So breakers, which are a fundamental part of getting these projects online, there are delays up to four years. And obviously, that will get remedied over time. But in the current situation, I think there are a lot of projects that we're seeing that we're expected to come online and achieve COD within, call it six to nine months, have now been pushed back in some cases as much as a year from the original expectations. So while some of the equipment issues and just the shipping and logistics issues that were prevalent in COVID have been addressed, some of the specific component and equipment manufacturing issues or shortages are still ongoing. And what's the solution to this? I know the Inflation Reduction Act, one of its aims was to bring some of that manufacturing offshore. But that's something nobody expects to happen overnight. So in the meantime, what are the solutions? The short answer is there is there's no magic bullet here where these issues get resolved quickly. I think there's obviously a focus on increasing manufacturing of whether it's transformers, breakers, some of the other components. But at the same time, I think the reality is we're in this longer term trajectory where projects will get developed. It's not going to happen as quick as I think the market expected. And frankly, the need for that power, if anything, is actually accelerating because we're seeing significant power demand growth, whether it's a function of the data crunching that comes from all the AI activity, the proliferation of data centers that are just significant consumers of power. We don't have a quick fix as it relates to renewable generation. And while a lot of capital is being invested, we think part of the solution also comes from conventional power, which can ultimately serve some of that short to medium term supply challenges. Yeah, when you look at the energy needs that are going to come from AI data centers, it's really staggering. And it seems like we're in the early innings of that. So the need to increase energy, I think, is really beyond what many people are thinking about. Would you agree? Without question. I think in the last few months, we've certainly seen a number of utilities materially increase their power demand growth projections. And I think that in turn is causing an acute awareness within folks in the industry here where there's clearly the demand side is there and increasing. And I think the expectation is, to your point, it is the early innings. If you think about how much data processing is required as AI really starts to pick up, one estimate that I've heard is if you look at a typical AI search function platform like ChatGPT, the amount of power required to complete that search is anywhere 10 to 20 times that of a traditional Google search. And so you start to extrapolate those numbers and the power demand that that entails is significant under any metric. And that juxtaposed to the supply side, like we just talked about, where renewable generation has some headwinds because of the supply chain issues, the regulatory issues in terms of getting new projects approved, the cost of capital issues, all that is causing delays in renewable generation. You're seeing developers and we're certainly seeing a lot of opportunities come back to conventional power as a part of the short to medium term solution. Obviously, depending on your frame of reference, there are some that are very focused on the energy transition and decarbonization, and they worry that going back to conventional sources of power generation sets us back. I think the challenge, of course, is in an ideal world, renewable generation would fill that void. But given the delays we've just talked about, conventional power seems like a bridge to addressing the power demand growth that we're seeing. And is the industry receptive to that or are there investors who have said we're only going to do renewables and now are saying, hey, we understand the role that conventional power must have in the market, or is there still an aversion from large swaths of the market that will be needed? I think we're at an interesting point, Andrew, where there are some investors that recognize that we need an all energy supply solution, which includes conventional power. And then you have those investors and managers that are really committed to a decarbonization strategy that are looking to non-fossil fuels power generation. And so I think the pendulum is swung a little bit. If you think back two years ago, I think the notion of even considering conventional power generation as part of the supply side solution was probably, you know, it was just a distinct minority of investors that were willing to consider that. As we sit here today and are faced with significant power generation demand issues and the growth in that, I think you're seeing some investors saying, OK, we're going to take a pragmatic approach here and not be dogmatic and look at conventional power and obviously making sure that from a responsible investing perspective that we try and limit CO2 emissions from those power generating sources. But I think there are some investors now that are willing to consider it, whereas two years ago that would have been a very distinct minority of investors. So the pendulum is swung back a little bit, and that's partially a result of the practical implications of seeing this type of power demand growth and the need to satisfy it. No one, and certainly whether it's utilities or the broader energy and power complex, no investor wants to see a situation where there are power shortages and brownouts in any market. And the reality is, if you take a look at some of the projections that people are using two, three, four or five years out, unless we find new sources of power generation, we could face those types of shortages down the road. And when you talk about conventional power, are you mostly talking about gas-fired peakers? I know that Alaska is talking about procuring another coal plant, but I don't see that generally being on the horizon. Are we mainly talking about peaker plants? Andrew, yes. I think the vast majority of conventional power investments that we're seeing are nat gas. There are some situations where potentially a combined cycle can make sense in terms of some baseload production, but most of it is really meant to address the peak demand circumstances and really is meant to play a stabilization role as we see increased renewable generation, some of the intermittency issues that come from that, and obviously energy storage is part of the solution there. But conventional peakers that are fueled by nat gas is the other set of investment opportunities that we're seeing right now. So Don, what role do you see Naveen play in solving some of these problems? Naveen is actually, from a strategic focus, has identified the infrastructure as an asset class at a general level as being a key strategic focus. And in particular, the strategy that we've been building here for the past two years focusing on energy and power is one of the core areas in infrastructure that requires capital. Naveen has basically said, this is an area that we as a firm want to focus on. We've identified that there's a significant need for capital and the type of capital solutions we're providing are flexible private capital that are meant to address some of the issues that we're seeing in the market today, whether it's given cost of capital issues, delays and inflationary pressures. By us being able to provide a bespoke capital solution that allows the project owners to develop these projects and ultimately bring them to completion is where our focus lies. And so Naveen as an institution is very focused on helping facilitate that investment. And we've been building a team here at Naveen. We now have 12 investment professionals as part of my team, really looking to focus on this area. We've identified it both in terms of growth and just the need for capital. And the firm has recently issued an equilibrium survey that showed that a lot of our clients on the investor side have identified infrastructure as an area that they'd like to invest in. So it's complimentary both in terms of having a very constructive market that needs this capital and an investor base that wants to invest in infrastructure assets. So in light of all this, in light of the challenges that the renewable sector is facing, we're almost two years from two year anniversary from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. How successful do you think that's been as a piece of legislation? Andrew, I think the Inflation Reduction Act has had both positives and some negatives. From an overarching perspective, the legislation has achieved its core objective, which is really to create the right investment environment for investors to deploy capital and ultimately help decarbonize the economy. The incentives are there. And I think the investor community has been very receptive to investing, whether it's in renewable generation, energy storage, looking at carbon capture as a way to reduce CO2 emissions and the on-shoring of the infrastructure supply chain. I think from an investor perspective, the overarching goals of the Inflation Reduction Act have been very supportive. The challenge has really been in the implementation. When the regulations took longer to really document and provide clarity for investors on how to make those investments, and two, just given the overriding cost of capital environment and some of the delays that we talked about earlier, that's made really utilizing all the carrots and the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act more challenging. And so as we sit here today, the framework makes the U.S. clearly one of the more desirable markets to invest for decarbonization in the energy transition. And yet the actual dollars deployed relative to expectations have probably been a little slower than I think most of us would have expected. And what happens if there's a new administration taking office nine months from now? Is that going to really slow down the progress on renewables that's been made or are these laws already into effect and really it'll just be around the edges? We've been giving a lot of thought to this and obviously from an investment perspective, we're thinking not just in terms of the immediate term, but just really how the legislation may change as a result of potential elections over the course of several years. I think there are a couple of key things to note. One, when you take a look at the actual invested dollars, the majority of those capital investments have gone into red states, whether it's the Southeast states like West Virginia or Texas. And so as we sit here and think about a potential election outcome where Republicans control the White House and potentially the other branches of government, we think the actual changes that could apply are really isolated to certain aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act. The changes may be in relation to some of the incentives perhaps around EV credits and some of the newer technology credits. But when you take a look at the core incentives, we think those are unlikely to change. And in particular, if you think about the 45X manufacturing credits, we think those are likely to stay regardless of which party ultimately controls the presidency or the other branches of government. I think the key aspect for investors is just having some certainty of outcome. My guess is you're going to see some delay in investments being made until after the election results are clear. And so as we go into the second half of the year, I think you'll see a slowdown. But then I think you'll see a resurgence on the back end and into next year as people become more comfortable that the outlier events or fears around the Inflation Reduction Act being completely rescinded, as those concerns really become more mute or there's clarity that that's not a risk. You'll see sort of a continuation of the investment trends we've been seeing over last year. Well, interesting stuff. Thank you for that, Don. And I'm afraid I think we are just about out of time. But for anybody who's interested in hearing more or reading more about Don's thoughts, I recommend reading the paper, The Solar Coaster. You can just Google Nuveen Solar Coaster. It'll come up. It's available to anyone, Don, correct? That's correct. Do a search and then log on to the Nuveen site. You should be able to access it. OK, great. I recommend that as reading for anybody interested in this. Well, Don, thank you so much for coming on the program and sharing your thoughts. Andrew, I really appreciated the invitation and have enjoyed our conversation and look forward to continuing it down the road. Absolutely likewise.

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior reporter for InfraLogic, and today I'm speaking with Gunther Glenk, an assistant professor of business at the University of Mannheim and a climate fellow at Harvard Business School's Institute for Business and Global Society. Dr. Glenk's research focuses on risks and opportunities in corporate decarbonization, and he's the co-author of a recent study on price trends for production of green hydrogen, which is a key component of the Biden administration's strategy for reducing emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy. Dr. Glenk, thanks so much for joining us today. Yeah, thank you for having me. And so your recent work focuses on cost trends for green hydrogen technologies. For those who may not be familiar with discussions around clean hydrogen, I wonder if you could give a brief description of how green hydrogen specifically differs from traditional, what we call gray hydrogen, as well as blue hydrogen, which is another technology that we're hearing a lot about in this space. Green hydrogen refers to the production of hydrogen from renewable or green electricity via water electrolysis. In this process, electricity induced in water splits the water molecule into oxygen and hydrogen. Gray hydrogen usually refers to the production of hydrogen from natural gas by the steam methane reforming. Here, methane and water molecules react to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Now blue hydrogen usually refers to the same production pathway as gray hydrogen, but the carbon dioxide is captured and not directly released into the atmosphere. Clean hydrogen usually includes both green and blue hydrogen. The global demand for hydrogen today amounts to about 100 million tons per year. Almost all of this hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels under substantial carbon emissions. And there is, of course, a lot of excitement around the possibility of using green hydrogen to displace gray hydrogen as an emission source and also reduce carbon emissions in a variety of other sectors, from heavy transportation to industrial heat. And the Biden administration's infrastructure and clean energy laws provide significant funding to move the technology forward. Can you tell us a little bit about your research on the cost of green hydrogen production and how production cost trends might impact the development of a clean hydrogen market in the United States? Widespread adoption of green hydrogen will depend on significant reductions in the cost of green hydrogen production. Our new study examines the cost dynamics of green hydrogen production. In particular, our study first estimates the so-called learning curves of different water electrolysis technologies in terms of the advances in system prices and energy efficiency over the past two decades. Such learning curves have served as a reliable measure of technological progress for solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbines, or lithium-ion batteries. Our estimates show that with every doubling of cumulative installed capacity, system prices of water electrolysis declined by 14 to 17 percent, while energy efficiency increased by about 2 percent. These calculations are based on data from power-to-gas plants commissioned worldwide between 2000 and 2020. Based on these estimates, we then project the trajectories of the lifecycle costs of electrolytic hydrogen production. Our projections here show that these costs will likely fall in the range of about $1.6 to $1.9 per kilogram by 2030, which is a decline from about $3 to $5 per kilogram today. And these values all exclude subsidies that might be available then. So if I understand you correctly, you're taking where the technology is in historical trends, but also comparing it with the way other technologies that have scaled up in similar ways have gained efficiencies and reduced in cost over time. Is that right? That is correct. And in the paper, you mentioned the Department of Energy's initiative to reduce the cost of green hydrogen to $1 a kilogram. As you've said here, you project the costs to approach that level by 2030, but they won't quite fall to that level. Can you tell us in real world terms what the significance of that dollar per kilogram target means and what it might mean for the sector if prices evolve the way you expect? A dollar per kilogram is often seen as the threshold at which green hydrogen becomes cost competitive with gray hydrogen, triggering the widespread adoption of green hydrogen. As you say, our projections suggest that the lifecycle costs of electrolytic hydrogen production will likely approach, but not quite reach this threshold. However, transaction prices for hydrogen actually span a wide range, comprising three main segments that vary primarily with scale and purity. Large scale supply between $1 and $2 per kilogram, medium scale supply between $2 and $4 per kilogram, and small scale supply above $4 per kilogram. Now based on these supply prices, green hydrogen production can be cost competitive with small and medium scale hydrogen supply from fossil fuels today. Furthermore, our projections show that green hydrogen will likely become widely cost competitive with large scale hydrogen supply in the range of $1 to $2 per kilogram. So it sounds like what you're saying is that by the end of the decade, you expect green hydrogen to become cheaper to produce than either gray or blue hydrogen for the uses that it's most commonly applied to now, and that you can see green hydrogen in the foreseeable future falling below the production cost at large scale production as well. Is that right? Yeah. Our study projects that green hydrogen production will likely become cost competitive with gray or blue hydrogen production in locations with great resources for renewable power generation. That means windy, sunny, or hydroelectric locations. But there is another aspect to consider, and that is the location of hydrogen customers. Ideally, hydrogen customers are located in areas with great resources for renewable power generation. For example, Texas is home to several large hydrogen customers today and has great resources for wind and solar power. If hydrogen customers are located elsewhere, you face a trade-off. You can either locate the electrolyzer close to your customer and produce hydrogen at a higher unit cost due to the lower utilization of your production capacity, or you can locate the electrolyzer in a place with great resources for renewable power generation, produce hydrogen at a lower unit cost, but then face the cost of transporting the hydrogen to your customer. The price ranges for hydrogen supply that I mentioned earlier reflect the willingness of customers to pay to have hydrogen delivered to their production site. Project developers for green hydrogen production will have to decide for each new project where to locate the electrolyzer, depending on their customers' willingness to pay for hydrogen and the availability of natural resources. Right, and I understand this goes beyond the scope of your research here, but my understanding is that the transport of hydrogen is both a very complicated and pricey question that the industry is looking to solve, right? That is correct, and it is currently still an open question which mode of transportation will be the cheapest form of transporting hydrogen across what type of distance. There can be road transportation with trailer trucks, there can also be pipelines, or there can be shipping of hydrogen across oceans. It depends on the distance that needs to be covered and sort of the ground that needs to be covered too. Right, and another interesting thing that you mentioned to me prior to the show is that in addition to production costs going down over time, the concentration of where those costs fall in the production process will also change over time. Can you explain to listeners why that might be and how that will affect the investment case for green hydrogen facilities? Electrolyzer technologies today still require a significant capital investment. Those system prices for equipment from Western manufacturers today range from about $1,000 to $2,000 per kilowatt of installed capacity, depending on the technology. A major share of the lifecycle costs of green hydrogen production therefore stems from the capital investment and fixed operating costs of the facility. Our study projects that the system prices will likely fall in the range of $250 to $450 per kilowatt for alkaline electrolyzers and PEM electrolyzer, and in the range of $450 to $750 per kilowatt for solid oxide cell electrolyzers by 2030. These three technologies are the three main electrolyzer technologies available in the market today. Now, with these reductions, electricity prices will become the dominant component of the lifecycle cost of hydrogen production by 2030. Achieving low costs of high green hydrogen production ultimately depends on the availability of inexpensive and clean electricity. Now, in addition to this change in the composition of production costs, the reduction in system prices is driving a second development. The higher system prices today require the operator of an electrolyzer to achieve a higher utilization of the production capacity. In other words, the operator seeks to use most hours of the year to convert electricity to hydrogen and only skip the hours with very high electricity prices. Now, lower system prices in the future will allow the operator to achieve a lower capacity utilization. That means the operator can skip more hours of the year with higher electricity prices. Or another way of looking at this is that electrolyzers will become better at handling intermittent power supply, not only from a technological point of view, but also from an economic point of view. So the increasing share of that variable operating cost and the total cost for producing the hydrogen will allow these green hydrogen facilities to operate more flexibly in response to their variable production from intermittent renewable resources. Exactly. And now there's a lot of excitement about the possible uses for green hydrogen as the sector grows in scale. Sticking with that 2030 timeline here, where do you expect green hydrogen to gain a place in the market as we get toward the end of the decade? And what should we be watching for with regards to the potential for green hydrogen to displace other existing energy sources? For the IRA, green hydrogen was first adopted by small and medium scale hydrogen customers who have a higher willingness to pay for hydrogen supply. Examples of such customers include food processing companies, electronics manufacturers, and pharmaceutical and chemical companies. With the subsidies available under the IRA of up to $3 per kilogram, green hydrogen has also attracted substantial investments from large scale customers. Such customers today mainly include ammonia or fertilizer producers and oil and gas refining companies. So the IRA appears to have significantly accelerated the adoption of green hydrogen by both existing and new hydrogen customers. Prominent examples of new customers already making investments on the ground include steel producers and producers of synthetic aviation or marine fuels. It remains more an open question to what extent green hydrogen will be used in heavy duty ground transportation and electricity storage. Here hydrogen stands in direct competition with batteries, which are also experiencing rapid technological and cost developments. It is often argued that hydrogen would be more suitable for long distance transportation and long term energy storage, while batteries would be more suitable for shorter distances and short term energy storage. But really it remains unclear where the transition from one technology to the other technology would be. And it is also conceivable that the two technologies will coexist serving different parts of the markets. And with regard to these potential use cases that are kind of further out in the future and harder to reach, I think it's interesting to note here that the EPA has a current proposal to cap power plant emissions that would by around 2040 require the use of either emissions capture technology or the substitution of green hydrogen as a fuel source at new natural gas plants. From what you're saying about the input energy as a component of the cost for producing green hydrogen, it doesn't necessarily sound like using green hydrogen for a big continuously operating gas plant is likely to be the most efficient use for the technology. Is that right? Well with the growing share of renewable power generation, natural gas power plants will increasingly take on the role of peaker plants, complementing the intermittent power generation from wind and solar energy sources. This development can already be observed in jurisdictions with high shares of renewable power generation, such as California, Texas, the United Kingdom, and Germany. These jurisdictions have also seen a strong growth in the deployment of grid scale battery energy storage. And this growth, if it continues over the coming years, will further reduce the share of electricity generation provided by natural gas power plants. Now as you say, natural gas power plants can install a carbon capture unit or switch to green hydrogen to further reduce their direct emissions. In any case, gas power plants will experience a declining utilization due to the other market dynamics I just described. This will require operators to charge higher markups on the variable operating costs to recover the fixed and capital costs of their capacity. An alternative to hydrogen-fired gas power plants could be reversible electrolyzers. PEM and solid oxide cell electrolyzers, two of the main technologies today, they can convert electricity to hydrogen at times of ample power supply, but they can also operate in the reverse direction to deliver electricity during times when power is relatively scarce and therefore more expensive. A key advantage of such reversible systems is that they can achieve a high capacity utilization. This allows operators to charge only small markups on the price of hydrogen used to generate electricity. And in turn, this could make such systems more competitive than gas power plants based on hydrogen or carbon capture in a future energy system. Well, it's certainly going to be interesting to watch as these market technology and policy dynamics all play out in the coming decades. Dr. Glenk, that's all the time we have for today.

I'm Siddhesh Mainkar, senior reporter at Ion Group's North America coverage. I would be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to invite our guest today. He's Jose Antonio Moran, principal at Baker McKenzie in Chicago. He focuses on financing on energy and infrastructure projects. Welcome to the show, Jose. Thank you so much, Siddhesh. It's a pleasure being here. I look forward to our conversation this morning. Today we're going to talk about various important and interesting topics, such as the impact of President Biden's signature legislations, IRA, post the US elections, and other regulations concerning ESG and tax equity. Do you anticipate IRA being repealed or FERC key policies changing in the next year, given the current climate in Washington? That's a great way to start. I think it's a question that a lot of people have been posing to their lawyers, advisors. My personal opinion, frankly, Siddhesh, is that it would be difficult to repeal the IRA as it is being enacted right now in the US. There has been a lot of growth with respect to renewable energy and renewable projects in many states where the governments governing the states are Republican. So there's a significant stakeholder interest right now with respect to the investments made. For example, this past year in 2023, Texas was the state with the most new solar and wind capacity installations and the second with respect to battery storage. So the way I see this is that the IRA basically will stay for a while. Yeah, interesting. Could you tell me a bit more about the ESG and energy trusts, you know, have been the sticky points as far as the M&E landscape is concerned? What is the likely future of, you know, uniform federal ESG standards or reporting requirements? That's a great question. I mean, I think that you move to the ESG standards to date, basically there has not been a concerted push in the US to codify any ESG standards or reporting requirements through legislation by Congress. However, on March 6th, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, approved disclosure requirements for certain publicly traded companies regarding their carbon emissions and other climate change risks. And the way that the SEC came about this regulation is by requiring more rules and their different type of regulations. And those were scope one, scope two. Scope one relates to direct emissions that are owned or controlled by a company. So a company that creates the emissions and controls the emissions has to provide disclosure schedules at what the SEC described as scope one. And then scope two, it's more indirect emissions that come from where the energy is being produced. So if a company that is publicly traded basically purchases energy from a third party, which is normally the case, then they need to look at how is that energy being produced. There were also some further sets of rules that were even more indirect, and that was the scope three. However, those requirements basically, which mainly related to supply chain. So creditors, the providers, the individuals that were providing basically equipment or raw material to that company that is publicly traded had to report on the actual emissions from those providers. Right now, scope three is out of the question for now. But again, together with the US federal regulation, which is the SEC regulation, companies also need to focus on what California has enacted. In California, the enactments of ESG regulation have been broader than basically what the SEC provided, and they include scope three. So they go more to the indirect. So that has been basically, or that is right now, the forecast or the plan going forward. Stricter SEC oversight, CDESH, over ESG reporting is likely to protect investor rights and ensure uniformity of disclosures. Obviously, the SEC since 2021 has also focused on prosecuting ESG-related misconduct, so-called greenwashing, and bringing enforcement actions and levying fines. So that, in my opinion, is how the landscape with respect to federal ESG standards and reporting requirements looks like. Yeah, sure. Let's dive a little bit deeper into this ESG, which is my favorite topic for the benefit of our listeners. Talking about ESG and other major M&A deals that have happened in the recent past, what sort of impact these deals would have on the renewable space? Well, this is a great question, CDESH, and obviously this is in the forefront of every transaction and I think at every board level, at least within energy companies, and I know that it goes beyond energy companies. In the energy space, obviously we have seen a trend of big institutional investors acquiring platforms to invest in energy transition, renewables infrastructure. At the same time, some oil mayors seem to be retrenching somewhat with their investments in renewables. And again, these types of transactions may allow new participants to enter the market or existing participants to further strengthen their position. I believe that if we look at what has happened in the last few years, there has been a consolidation trend in the renewables industry over the last few years, and what is really interesting is that instead of single asset deals for projects that have achieved notice to proceed or commercial operation transactions involving portfolios of multiple renewable energy projects have dominated the market due to the economies of scale, efficiency with respect to transaction costs, and obviously with a variety of technologies. So when you look at these transactions, they're not just focusing on solar or wind, they're doing basically both and obviously bringing in also battery storage, bringing in also other types of investors. The typical tax of investors in the US will be tax equity, but also cash equity. The cash equity investors are generally a layer up in the capitalization structure of the company. So I think that the time basically in the US for Wild West post notice to proceed and operating solar, wind, and battery storage projects is likely over and only major industry players will be able to secure competitive financings and tax equity. Also when we look at supply chain and relationships with large providers, those large investors are able to manage their global supply chain in a way that helps them satisfy sometimes certain bottlenecks. And in some cases, they're able to delay projects in some regions of the world and accelerate the supply in others. That's how I see the ESG with respect to recent major M&A deals and how sprinkled the ESG concept becomes. Yeah, definitely. Thanks for that, Hussein. And another aspect that has been the talk of the town has been the tax equity. How are developers and investors taking advantage of tax equity financing? And how big is this really the market of tax equity and how big it will become? It's a very interesting market and a very interesting incentive, especially when you look at other regimes, who would have thought that the biggest investors in renewable energy in the US are the largest taxpayers. And the reason for that obviously is that they can accumulate tax credits provided under the Internal Revenue Code to lower their tax liability. The Inflation Reduction Act, what it did basically in a way is supercharge the tax equity market by providing more predictability for the availability of the tax credits. In past years, tax credits were approved, but they were always approved almost on New Year's Eve. So that was very hard for the actual investors and developers because they were always approved in the last minute. Now there's more predictability because now the investors know that they are available for the next few years. And in many cases, they will be running through 2034. And also the other big element of the IRA is that they are providing these new tax credits are providing more flexibility and opportunities for other individuals to participate in the market or to benefit basically from the tax credits through what it's called the transferability. Now tax credits could be transferred once to third parties. Those third parties can purchase those at a small discount. And the most interesting piece of that is that the purchasers that may buy the tax credits obviously could apply those in their tax return, do not need to be involved with an actual energy project. They don't need to be a shareholder together with a developer like the traditional tax equity holder used to be. So that's, in my opinion, has been one of the most interesting characteristics. So the transferability of tax credits basically unlocked basically a huge market bottleneck and allowed basically more people to come in into this market. What I think also is quite important right now when you look at the legislation, the IRA is that it provides tax credits obviously for production. There are also other mechanisms such as the direct pay, which allows tax exempt entities, tribal and native entities, rural energy cooperatives, and governmental entities to receive a payment equal to the full value of the tax credits for basically developing qualifying clean energy projects. Also the other thing that a lot of people is talking about, and there are already projects taking place, is that there are additional now incentives for hydrogen production. The production of electricity through hydrogen has a tax credit and also for carbon capture and storage projects under the IRA. It's basically focused on trying to transition, frankly, from fossil fuels to renewable energy and in some cases, doing the carbon capture if you're still operating under fossil fuel technologies. So again, the plan is here to basically transition and be able to replace the capacity installed in the US into a more diverse pool of electricity. That's fantastic, Jose. There has been the talk of town in terms of the tax equity. How are developers and investors taking advantage of this tax equity financing structure and how big is this market of tax equity and how would it become? In my opinion, the IRA has supercharged the tax equity market by that. What do I mean? I mean that one, it has provided more predictability for the availability of tax credits over the next few years, with many running through 2034. In the past, tax credits were generally approved in the last sessions of Congress and those were almost approved at the end of the year, so there was not much of a horizon for the investors and the developers. But now also, this supercharging includes providing more flexibility and opportunities for new market participants. What do we mean by that? We really mean transferring the tax credits to potential investors and in this case, individuals that basically will be applying the tax credits in their consolidated tax returns without being shareholders or without becoming involved with the actual development, operation or maintenance of the project. So you can have any big corporate that needs to pay taxes, can be offered tax credits, they can buy those tax credits. There's currently a slight discount on the purchase price, it's $1 for $1 and basically that's what we have seen. There are different ways obviously to monetize the tax credits on the IRA and it will depend obviously on the investor's tax appetite and also some of the accounting rules with respect to depreciation and the step-up basis. But basically today, in today's world, thanks to the IRA, tax credits are directly bought and sold by a purchaser and seller and there's a market for that. That market did not exist before the IRA. Again, there are new opportunities for other types of projects including that do not include tax credits and that's the direct pay. So I wanted just to share some thoughts on that. Direct pay allows for basically receive direct funds equivalent to the amount of tax credits and that it's open for tax exempt entities, tribal and native entities, rural energy cooperatives and governmental entities so they can receive the full value of the tax credits for building qualifying clean energy projects. That means basically projects that have been described in the regulations and in addition obviously there are additional tax credits for hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage projects. We have these ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. What's the impact these events would have on US power markets and M&A activity here? So here in the US and obviously with respect to M&A activity, as a result basically of these geopolitical issues and tensions, there has been a greater sensitivity with respect to electricity supply and also fuel price volatility as well as maintaining access to fuel supply. The US hasn't been directly affected by obviously the gas or the shortage of gas coming from Russia. The US has developed over the last few years, you know, the shale gas industry that has permitted the US to become an exporter of gas. So and obviously we've also relied on our good friend neighbors, the Canadians and Canadian gas that has always been transported and brought into the US. At the same time, I think there's a question whether more local energy production from renewable energies, renewable resources could provide more insulation from these price shocks. I think that, and this is my personal view, I mean, the gas market is going to stay with us together with the growth of energy, of renewable energy. But obviously there are countries that depend heavily on the import of fossil fuels, primarily natural gas for power generation. We see that obviously in Latin America. We also see that in countries in Europe that decided basically to perhaps concentrate most of their supply chain with respect to fossil fuels. But on the other hand, I think that in the US, what we're seeing is that there will be more investments in renewables that will obviously help to accelerate the M&A activity. And at the end of the day, also consolidation within that market. So as I mentioned before, I think that bigger players will consolidate. There will still be some developers, smaller developers, but I think that perhaps in five years from now, the market is going to look much different. Not sure there will be the developers that we're seeing now bringing projects to fruition. I think there will be large multi-utilities doing this kind of work. Another question that I wanted to ask you is about Biden's recent pause on energy exports. How do you think it will impact the investment in the downstream sector? In today's market, I think that that is something that was expected. I mean, when we look at the FERC composition right now, the nomination of three new FERC commissioners could reshape the dynamics, I think, on a number of topics, including obviously the exportation of gas. But the reality is that the exports of gas from the US have been a success. Many foreign multi-utilities and sometimes their gas trading arms have bought billions of cubic meters of American gas produced basically in the different areas in the US. That industry, again, has developed an entire backbone from pipelines to transportation to liquefaction terminals, export terminals. So I think that the Biden administration nominated two Democratic commissioners, one Republican commissioners, all of whom have different experiences in the energy sector. But the reality is that there's an industry behind that. And I don't expect for that to, again, to decrease. Why? Because, again, not every country is at the same level, Sidesh, of development with respect to energy transition and fossil fuels and natural gas will still be considered as a necessary source. And therefore, the US will have the ability to basically provide those licenses to export the gas that is produced in the US. That was insightful, as I'd expected. Thanks for coming in, Jose. Thank you so much, Sidesh, for spending the time with me this morning. It's been a pleasure. Please support our podcast with a like, subscribe, repost or share. This is your host signing off. Bye for now.

I'm Matt O'Brien, a reporter and senior editor for InfraLogic's North American coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today, someone who's going to give us his view on some of the particular issues around digital infrastructure space we've been watching closely here at InfraLogic. Our regular readers have seen day in and day out. I have with me GI Partners Managing Director and Co-Head of the firm's Data Infrastructure Strategy, Mark Privatok. Mark, welcome. How are you doing today? Thank you, Matt. It's great to be with you. Likewise. Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. So data centers, fiber optics, right up there with renewable energy and energy transition opportunities accounting for most M&A and capital raise volume. We're about a year or two among all infra subsectors, according to our data. And it's no secret, if you're a reader of InfraLogic, that GI Partners has been extremely busy buying and doing partial sell downs of assets lately. So I really wanted to get your take on a few things that I've been thinking about lately and all of us have internally. I think the best way to get the conversation going, I wanted to open it up with development constraints. For a little while now, I've been listening to various digital infra operators, investors talk about a variety of constraints that are posing issues for greenfield development, whether it's power transmission lines or supply chain challenges, whatever have you. Can you, Mark, can you give me your take on this issue more broadly and how certain players are dealing with these issues? Sure, Matt. I think the first thing to think about is the fact that in a number of areas across data infrastructure, we're in an environment of rapid expansion. The demand for capacity, not just data centers, which I know we're going to talk about, but also broadband connectivity to homes. We're seeing trends of growth and development and construction that are really unparalleled in our history. And so the strains that that pace of development puts on supply chains, on organizational infrastructures to manage these processes is something that we're all in the industry, a bit learning as we go. And we're seeing rapid growth, but also not unexpectedly bumps in the road along the way. I think the most dramatic piece of this to talk about is in the data center side. And over the past decade plus, we've been engaged in a massive build cycle around the development of public cloud. And then over the past 18 months or so, really since the rollout of chat GPT, we've seen a tremendous amount of growth, particularly around generative AI, and in particular generative AI training models. And we are in an environment where we've gone from a relative surplus of data center capacity going back to 2019, 2020, 2021, to an environment where we are now pretty significantly constrained in terms of supply to meet the coming demand. And that has created a dynamic where the constraints really depend, depending on the market that we're talking about, but everything from availability of mechanical, electrical, componentry equipment to sit in data centers, to breakers to sit in substations, to the availability of transmission to bring power generation to the locations where data center capacity is needed most. I appreciate that. Thanks. Speaking of constraints, just getting a little bit more specific here, everyone has been following the challenges around procuring power for data center development, issues with Dominion, Northern Virginia, highlight that. And let's keep in mind what AI and advanced compute means for power demand. I was at the MetroConnect conference last week, I heard one of your peers, Marconzi, said the industry is less than 15 or 16 years away, where 80% of all data center power will be consumed by AI, whereas today, AI represents less than 10% of power consumed by data center. Can you talk to me what your expectations are for power demand for data center facilities and what that will look like going forward? Yeah, so the numbers that we're looking at, Matt, suggest that we're going to have an aggregate increase of roughly 15 gigawatts of demand for data centers over the next 10 years. Sorry, not even 10 years, next five or six years, you know, three through 2030. That's roughly a doubling from where we are today. So if you think about all the data center capacity that's been constructed over the past, call it 25, 30 years, and now over the next five years, we're going to double that. It necessarily is putting strains on the system. And the reality is, you know, data centers are located in fairly significant clusters. So you know, while we may have sufficient power generation, sufficient power supply across the country, what matters is, do you have sufficient power supply and the means by which to get that power to the relevant data center locations within a particular cluster or close enough to that cluster for the relevant applications to run? And so that's really what we're seeing here in Northern Virginia, for instance, and increasingly in other markets as well in Dallas, the area surrounding Dallas, surrounding Atlanta, you know, Columbus, Ohio, markets that you would never have thought about being constrained all of a sudden on the basis of all the demand flowing primarily from generative AI at this point are causing some significant questions about where that is going to come from. Interesting. Yeah. I guess we'll see how that pans out. Hey, listen, on the A side of things, artificial intelligence, can you give me some use cases driven by AI that will help our listeners how to think about how that technology will shape the digital infrastructure in the years ahead? What we're seeing use cases from AI today and in our own investments within GI data infrastructure, we're seeing AI have significant impacts in customer care. For instance, within our fiber businesses, AI is performing diagnostics on Wi-Fi routers inside customers' homes and identifying those routers that are likely to break down in a reasonable period of time, and then sending technicians that are on the road to say, hey, if you're doing a customer call that happens to be within a few blocks of a customer that today, their system's working fine, but we think within the next few weeks, it's likely to break down, drop off a new router today, rather than rolling another truck a few weeks from now. That's a pretty incredible improvement, number one, in the customer experience, right? They never have to go a day without an operable home internet. But from the standpoint of the company and the cost structure, those truck rolls are expensive. It's the time for a technician, it's fuel for the truck, and going back to what we said at the top of the podcast, in an environment where there's a tremendous amount of growth around new build, new installations, if we can keep those technicians focused on installing new customers, rather than doing repairs for existing customers, that's a big win. Another area where we see a lot of real benefit today from AI is around what we typically would call the internet of things, and we refer to it as tech-enabled infrastructure. So businesses that take sensors, meters, cameras, collections of connected devices, collecting millions if not billions of data points every day, and pulling that data, aggregating it, and using AI to identify patterns in that behavior are enabling businesses to generate real return on investment in those IoT deployments. For instance, one of our portfolio companies which provides sensors that are used on transport and logistics assets, the customer was able to recognize a 45% reduction in fuel costs by optimizing delivery routes, utilizing the data provided from the sensors on their fleet of vehicles. So not only are we able to use all that data to identify patterns of behavior, recommend specific fixes or decisions to optimize business operations, but also to calculate very clear returns on investment to those companies. And that really creates a virtuous circle where those companies are then more inclined to make those investments because they can very clearly demonstrate in an environment where capital costs are higher, you've got an attractive return on investment there. It's incredible. Very, very interesting stuff. I'd say that is what we refer to as machine learning. The two examples I just described, when we talk about generative AI, we're just starting to scratch the surface. But the numbers that we see suggest trillions of dollars of economic value created in the business space, significant opportunities that we're starting to see around the medical industry, in terms of development of pharmaceuticals, significant opportunities that we're seeing. And we're starting to see this roll out in terms of marketing and sales efforts, utilizing generative AI to create better sales scripts that are tailored specifically to the psychometrics that appeal to different customer bases. So this is all very, very much in the early days, but the applicability across a range of industries is immense. Thanks for that. Yeah. All very interesting stuff. We'll be keeping tabs on, certainly. I want to talk to you about Fiber the Home. So we're just going to pivot here slightly. We've been seeing a number of incumbents pull back on pro forma passings for 24, given the cost environment and probably some other factors. Look, it's an industry that's capex intensive, still needing massive investment to broaden fiber's reach across North America, North American market, and U.S., another 55% of the country still doesn't have fiber access. Can you give me your outlook on the industry against this backdrop? We still think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity here. We're very happy with the businesses that we've invested in that are providing residential broadband to customers, various regions across the U.S. I think it's important to distinguish between competitive, highly competitive markets, which tend to be more urban or near suburban markets, and markets that are still fundamentally underserved, which tend to be smaller communities, sometimes more rural, less population density. I think where we've seen cuts in the forecast from some of the strategics are largely in places where, number one, they've done the work to assess the cost to build, and that cost to build is high relative to the competitive intensity of a given market. And so it's not unexpected that where you have a number of, or maybe not a number, but multiple competing announcements of build in a particular community, it is a, what we sometimes refer to as a land grab. And the first one to put the backhoe in the ground is the one who's going to win that customer. And in many cases, it's no longer economic for player number two to start their build. So you would expect to see some reductions in the announced passings, just driven by that competitive dynamic. And that's good, right? That's rational behavior by market participants not to overbuild, where you're less likely to achieve an economic return. We applaud that. We're also seeing the dynamics of increased cost, right? Inflation has had a meaningful impact on this industry. And that's everything from increasing labor rates to increasing the cost of componentry. And while inflation is slowing, those costs are still fundamentally meaningfully higher than they were when a lot of those original build forecasts were being put out, call it two, three years ago. Yeah, right. And others have told me similar talk about overbuilding a couple of months ago, we put out maybe more than that, but we put out a story on fiber optic players, attacking the beginning to tap the ABS market, right? And overbill was, was one of the concerns if you see that could impact ABS cash flows. So that's one trend I want to bring up with you and get you on the record here, what your outlook is fiber executives looking to tap this financing mechanism. So what are some of the opportunities and risks that you see? The reason you see companies tapping that market is that, you know, and it goes back to again, what we were talking about at the very beginning, we're in this period of unprecedented expansion. And that expansion is highly capital intensive. There are limits to what can be accommodated within the traditional commercial bank markets. And therefore, you know, it's very logical to ask, okay, where do we go once we've aggregated a base of operations, that's sufficiently diverse and sufficiently stable to support a long-term financing solution like the ABS market. And so, you know, we've had success within GI accessing the ABS market for, for some of our businesses. I do think it's, it's not a one size fits all solution. These markets work best when we're talking about businesses that are very, very predictable that are benefiting from, you know, from, from contracted cash flows, or, you know, again, a highly diverse customer base where you've got a very reliable dream of cash flows over a very long period of time. We've seen the expansion of this market into, you know, certainly retail fiber to the home. Some of the markets that are best or some of the revenue models that are best positioned to take advantage are revenue models that rely on contracted streams of cash flow through, for instance, sales to homeowner associations or condo associations, where the revenue stream is actually built into the residence annual dues, as opposed to a competitive retail environment. And you know, I think we'll be interested to watch how that market continues to evolve for more traditional retail. The number of players that have tapped it for that purpose, pretty limited today. We do expect that to grow, but again, that really is dependent on achieving significant scale. And there are, you know, I think a smaller number of, at least the sponsor back providers today that have a requisite scale for that. Let's keep the focus on financing. There's a lot of talk about the data center and even fiber optic industries using project finance. You know, this is an area where the reporters and research analysts are pretty comfortable with project finance. We were pretty much founded as a project finance trade news publication many, many years ago. Project finance is usually costlier than the loan or bond market to fund build outs in this case. You know, and I thought it was interesting, you know, when you and I were talking about doing this, you told me you started your career out in project finance. So now I'm very interested to see how you answer this, but talk to me about why the digital infrastructure is pursuing this type of financing. It's pretty simple. And the reason that parties utilize project finance is when the risk associated with a particular project, not going well, right. A risk of failure puts at risk the financial wherewithal of the entire enterprise. And so if you're an owner of a business, you never want to make a kind of franchise bet, right. So when we're in an environment now, we're particularly in the data center space. The scale of the developments, the scale of the data center campuses being requested by the hyperscalers, the Amazons, Google's, Microsoft's, we're now talking about hundreds of megawatts. We're talking about projects that, you know, on an individual project basis can be in the billions of dollars. And when you're at that scale, the risk of a failure or the risk from the standpoint of a lender or the standpoint of a developer can put an entire company at risk. And so when you're in that position, you can utilize project finance to allocate the risks to those parties that are best able to handle those, right. And to finance on a non-recourse basis where, you know, you're looking directly at the lessee, for instance, for the revenue stream rather than the credit of the developer. And in this case, that makes sense because those lessees, again, the Amazons, the Microsoft's, the Google's are some of the largest and most credit worthy companies in the entire world. And as high quality of businesses, even some of the largest data center, you know, developers and operators are, they're nowhere near the scale or credit worthiness of those customers. So in that case, project finance becomes a very attractive means of raising money. The other dynamic here is just the sheer amount of money that needs to be raised. And you know, that is a relatively large market where, you know, you're seeing borrowers access funding, not just from the big, you know, traditional project finance banks that are used to funding, you know, roads and airports and power generation projects, but you're also seeing them approach traditional real estate markets for financing. Right. Gotcha. So we've mentioned ABS, project finance. I'm pretty sure conventional bank lenders and private credit funds won't sit idle. How do you see these competitive dynamics playing out for both sides, borrower and lender? We operate in the mid market. GI's investment strategy is really focused on investing in businesses that are measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars rather than the billions of dollars. For us, the commercial bank markets are still quite robust. But again, you know, as we think, sort of pull the lens back and look industry wide, there is a very significant need to continue expanding the pool of available capital resources. And I think that looking at the bond markets, you know, the private placement markets, which support multiples of financing capacity year in, year out, as compared to what we see, let's say, in the ABS market is a very logical place to go. So, you know, I think if we look at the overall, the total volume of ABS that's been done, over the past few years around data centers, fiber, tower businesses, obviously, tower space has been accessing this market for many, many years. But we're talking about $10 billion a year, maybe $12 billion a year. That pales in comparison to the overall scale of the private market, the private placement market. And so, you know, it'll be interesting to see how this continues to evolve. But without a doubt, in order to meet the needs of the construction and expansion, you know, boom that we're in, and that will continue over the next several years, we need those new sources of capital to show up. Gotcha. Yeah, thanks for that. Go back to a little bit, we're talking about the risk sharing component behind project finance. You know, when I was listening to operators, investors talk about project finance for their respective projects, I also hear them talk, discuss risk transfer. This is a big theme at our USP3 conference. Always hear it on multiple panels throughout the course of the two-day event. Risk transfer, which is to say, it means, you know, the project partners sharing various risks among partners, counterparties, offtakers. When I was at the MetroConnect conference, you know, and this topic kept coming up, I mean, the panelists, it was like being back at USP3 again, the conversations were very similar. Again, at InfraLogic, like I said, we've been listening to these discussions for years among core Infra investors and public procurement officials. What can you expand on that risk sharing, that risk transfer mechanism for project done as project finance? What's this going to look like within the digital infrastructure? I don't think it looks fundamentally different from the way project finance looks for any other, you know, sector. Essentially, what you're doing is you're taking the risks associated with a project, whether that's procurement of critical equipment, construction, offtake, right, or in the context of a data center, the lease counterparty, and the operations, and assigning those risks to the parties that are best able to handle that particular risk. And it goes back to what I was saying earlier about the sheer size of these projects. And, you know, even though risk of failure is very low on any one given risk factor, the impact of a failure when you're talking about a billion-dollar project on any given company is immense, right? So, it's only by dividing those risks and apportioning them to the parties that are best able to handle them contractually that you're able to achieve successful project financing. In that regard, you know, data centers are no different from the asset classes that have been project financed for the past 40 or 50 years now, you know, whether that's pipelines, or roads, or, you know, or airports, or renewable energy projects. Last question for you. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about M&A. So, M&A generally, last year and a half, maybe even two years, has been slow for well-advertised reasons. What's your predictions for 2024 and 2025 and some of the drivers of that activity? We're looking forward to a pretty robust 2024 and onward, you know, a couple of factors at play. Number one, and again, I mean, you know, not to repeat myself, but the sheer capital intensity of the cycle that we're in and we will continue to be in for the next many years, and whether that's driven by the need for broadband connectivity in homes and businesses, or the the growth of generative AI, or the mass adoption of IoT solutions, that requirement of capital is a catalyst for transaction activity. And so, you know, companies, even if they don't like where valuations are, or owners of companies, I should say, even if they don't like where valuations are today relative to maybe high watermarks that we saw in terms of multiples in two years ago, at some point, that need for capital is the overwhelming driver and, you know, creates a dynamic where, you know, where people will come to the market. The other thing is we're just in a fundamentally more stable economic environment, it feels like today, than we were 12 or 18 months ago. Inflation has moderated, right? Interest rates have stabilized, you know, we'll see if they come down or not. But an environment of, you know, greater stability allows a greater likelihood that buyers and sellers can, you know, can come to agreement on valuations. So we're feeling pretty good about the market upcoming. Got it. Yeah, I think we are too. I look forward to covering a lot more deals that are coming for sure. Well, hey, listen, that's all I got for you, Mark. That takes care of it. All right. Thanks for having me, Matt. You got it. I want to thank our guests and our listeners for tuning in. Don't forget to like and subscribe to Crossroads Podcast and we'll see you next time.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter and senior editor for InfoLogic's North American coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today, someone who's going to go over the ever-changing landscape of fund managers and unlimited partners, leading over some surprise asset targets this year, and some other things that are going on in the infra-investing universe. I have with me Managing Director and Global Co-Head, Business Development Infrastructure, Partner Groups, Irene Bavarianas. Irene, welcome. How are you? Thank you, Matt. Great to be here and to participate in this podcast, and of course, to talk about my favorite subject, infrastructure. Happy to hear that. Well, I got the right person on then. Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. And so, like usual, there's a lot going on with InfraFunds themselves, capital formation, what they're targeting and the like. I'm hoping to get some of your unique perspective on the latest that we've been tracking here at InfoLogic that daily readers are more than familiar with, some of the issues and themes that we tackle. Let's just jump in. Now, it seems like the big keep getting bigger, especially in light of recent GP level M&A, we'll call it that. I want you to talk to me about why some GPs over the last few years have shifted their strategy of focusing more on the mega capitalization space. Sure. Great question. You know, in our view, it's largely attributable to a couple of factors. The first is that infrastructure is a young asset class. It really started taking off in the last 10 to 15 years. In 2000, there were seven fund managers who raised over a billion dollars. In 2022, there were 156 funds that raised $176 billion. So as investors have been appreciating and begun to appreciate the benefits of the asset class, namely the inflation protection, stable returns, exposure to essential assets, they've been allocating more capital to the space. And as allocations to the asset class have grown, a small number of well-known manager, primarily the early entrance into infrastructure, have grown their fund sizes alongside the LPs to take advantage of growing appetite for the strategy. As you correctly noted, you know, the recent M&A activity in the infraspace, BlackRock, Corning, GIP, General Atlantic, and Actis have reinforced the shift towards larger fund sizes. Coming back to mega cap, mid cap, there really is no standard definition of mega cap, just like there is no standard definition of what is infrastructure. But from our perspective, you need to look under the hood of the size of the fund at the size of the equity check to give you a backup envelope indication of whether it's a mid market or a mega fund. Equity checks north of about a billion dollars, in our view, would qualify or could easily be considered as a mega fund. Thank you for that. Yeah, certainly look, the Blackstone GIP news, that story so far for 24 has received the most clicks on our end. It's definitely captured the attention, not surprisingly, of funds and LPs and everybody else, advisors, everybody else involved. So something we're keeping a close eye on for future tie ups. Let me ask you this, what are your findings on how that has impacted GP performance and how raising such funds is going in this, let's call it a difficult environment, fundraising? Another great question. I'd say as a general observation, we've seen an inverse correlation between the size of the fund and the performance of the fund. And this relates to the former mid market funds that have migrated into the mega space. Some of these have not continued to perform as previously. There could be a number of reasons for that fact, including difficulty in adapting a mid market strategy and skill set to a dramatically different investing landscape because the size of the sandbox in which the manager plays affects the breadth of the opportunity set. Mid market transactions, for example, typically lend themselves to proprietary acquisitions with scale up opportunities, whereas larger transactions may have a greater focus on corporate carve outs or take privates given the size of the equity check to be deployed. And there's also a difference in the optionality on exits. You know, mid markets typically will have more optionality on exits because the size of the ultimate equity check can be absorbed by a strategic, another larger fund or a corporate. When you're playing at the mega end of the scale, that optionality is somewhat limited, often to the IPO market, which I think we'll talk about later. On the fundraising aspect, namely whether strategy drift has negatively impacted some of these mega funds' ability to raise capital in this environment. It has, but quite frankly, the difficult environment has probably affected all of the fund managers, equally. However, with the growing appetite for the asset class, new investors are continuing to come into the space and they naturally have sought to deploy capital with the more established GPs. So this has actually reinforced the growth of the largest GPs and migration of fund sizes. Fundraising numbers tend to prove this out. About half of the total capital from 2020 to 2022 was raised by only 15% of the number of funds that were raised, which really means that LPs have portfolios that are concentrated with a small number of larger GPs. So ultimately, in this initial phase, the mega fund managers continue to do relatively well from a capital raising perspective, but this may change over time if they're unable to deliver on returns and as the private infrastructure and asset class continues to grow and mature. Those are interesting figures you threw out. And like I said, it feels like we're in a new world where the big just keep getting bigger. It's incredible. I just want to switch gears slightly here. What assets are typically not associated with infrastructure yet display those infrastructures could serve as targets by GPs this year. Often, when we look at this issue and we've looked at it over the last few years, we usually use EQT's 2015 acquisition of Wash Multifamily Laundry Systems. Again, that was that company that provides, as the name would suggest, laundry systems for multifamily properties in the U.S. and Canada. I know there's been others since, but that's usually one we just cite often. So what is 2024's version of Wash? I won't talk about Wash specifically because I guess the focus I would take is on assets that are displaying infrastructure traits. So I would pivot slightly towards where do we see future demand for infrastructure that is consistent with assets that have infrastructure traits. So I think areas where you're going to see continued, if not greater expansion, obviously decarbonization is one area. And what's interesting is we expect to see more investments in decarbonization, but in energy efficiency, which is not typically appreciated as an infrastructure opportunity in the clean power space, which typically will focus on new sources of energy. So if you think about hydrogen, solar, wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, historically, it represents about a third of the solution towards achieving the Paris Accord decarbonization objectives. And yet you'll see most clean power or renewable focused on the traditional wind, battery storage, some electric vehicle charging, which is further off into the future. We, for example, made an investment in a company in the U.S. called Butterfly. It's a leading energy as a service platform. And what it does is it focuses on providing energy efficient solutions to small franchises because these businesses use 10 times more energy than commercial office buildings. If you think about the HVAC, you think about the fridge, the ovens of a McDonald's, a Wendy's, or even of a Dunkin' Donuts, then the implications and the opportunity set for investments in infrastructure in this space, which is very scalable, are pretty exponential. Other areas that you wouldn't typically think of as infrastructure, but that have infrastructure traits are in the social assets. If you think about health care and you think about education, given global structural trends of an aging population, increased urbanization and constrained public resources, I think we should expect to see more investment in assets that have a social aspect to them in light of the factors that I just described. So for example, we invested in radiology clinics in Germany, really a buy and build strategy focused on roll-ups and operational improvements, but these are assets that have an essential component of health care delivery, regulated market, regulated cash flows with built-in inflation protection. So not intuitively assets one would associate with infrastructure, but then again, infrastructure is not defined. It's really more defined by characteristics as opposed to any of the other private markets asset classes. Interesting. All right. That's a great insight. Thank you for that. You know, talking about service companies like Butterfly Radiology Company that you were citing before, can you talk to me about how executives are adapting infrastructure to shifting consumer needs? Sure. And again, you know, from our perspective, in order to be a successful infrastructure investor, it's critical to invest in infrastructure opportunities that are consistent with essential consumer needs, both near and long-term, because infrastructure is a long-term play. But as the infrastructure supporting consumer needs is typically driven by long-term structural trends, for example, you know, the increased need for social infrastructure that I just described, you know, growing urbanization, digitization, new living standards associated with e-commerce and working from home. It's important to take a long-term view on where these needs will go and focus on investment opportunities in related high growth sectors. For example, we made an investment in a U.S. trailer leasing business called Milestone, second largest lesser of trailers, fifth largest lesser of chassis in the U.S. The underlying thematic, so shifting consumer need, is the tremendous growth in marketplace as e-commerce drives the need for tech-enabled distribution and the importance for increasing efficiency and new living standard logistics to be closer to home, same-day delivery, reverse logistics. So that's really an underlying driver of consumer need. And then the intersection with how is this infrastructure, and that's how managers evolve the asset class, it's an essential product. Mission critical equipment, solutions to customers, has a very high and stable market share, very asset heavy. So these are the conundrums. This is the puzzle that managers are trying to solve. Where is that intersection between long-term consumer need and how does that fit into an evolving world and lifestyle standards? Gotcha. Interesting. Yeah. One of the things you pointed out, moving services and infra closer to the consumer, I feel like that's been a trend in various industries. Something we're definitely keeping a close eye on. I want to mention something about diversification. Many funds tout diversification, but can you talk to me about which assets might be a little bit more risky with the recession looming possibly? We are very wary on that subject as we are with others, because especially with infrastructure expectation of the asset class is to deliver long-term stable returns. Investments that have high GDP exposure, we see this typically in stretched definitions of infrastructure or in more traditional forms of infrastructure that are associated with elastic demand. So if you think about airports that primarily serve holiday consumers versus business travel and that derive a high component of their revenue from retail services, those types of investments will undergo more challenges in a market that is recessionary. Equally so, strategies that require or that rely actually on excessive leverage to support returns. These are other investments that would quite frankly fall into the same bucket in terms of increased risk against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. From a partner's group perspective, we wouldn't invest in these types of assets or take on that type of leverage because we adhere to a checklist of characteristics that for us if those checklists are not met, the asset is not deemed to be an investable infrastructure asset. Similarly, with a strategy of hands-on value creation as opposed to relying on financial structuring, engaging in excessive leverage for us is not the most prudent way to generate returns. Those are, I guess, two major buckets that investors should be wary of as in a very wobbly market. Right. Being highly leveraged is like the kiss of death when a recession hits. Again, another thing we're keeping an eye on, so interesting indeed. What can you share about the type of conversations you guys are having at a partner's group with LPs on targeted strategies that may appeal to LPs but that do carry risk in deploying capital and exiting? Sure. Happy to share on that. First of all, to be clear, every and all investment strategy involves risk, whether the manager is investing at the core end of the spectrum or any other risk return profile. There is no such thing as a riskless strategy in the private markets or the public markets unless we're looking at investing in treasuries or T-bills, and even those involve a different set of risks. Our strategy is primarily value creation through platform building, which involves commercialization and development risk. So a partner's group, we wear both of these risks, and we believe we've created a playbook for successfully executing the strategy while managing the risk, and we do that using several mechanisms. Firstly, we spend success-based CapEx to support organic growth, which goes back to my point on the financial leverage to generate returns or support returns. We build our platforms using equity and really take a modular approach to expansion. As I said, success-based CapEx to finance the expansion rather than adding risk by levering a development project. And secondly, our prudent use of leverage overall in terms of financing the project is a critical component. We apply leverage when the platform is at more of an operational stage, which again enables us to generate the most balanced risk return profile in the targeted strategy of platform building that we execute. Gotcha. Great. Thanks. Going back to exits, speaking of exits, I was talking to a banker the other day, mentioned that we should be on the lookout for IPOs this year, possibly, from info holdings. Usually when you talk about that type of exit, it's more associated with venture capital, right? So what can we expect to see here this year or even next? Conditions were tough for IPO exits last year. I think generally speaking, they were tough for exits as managers and LPs were grappling with where valuations should or should not be. So IPO exits were off the table for much of the year as investors adopted a risk-off approach. 2024, we should see this start to unwind as we're seeing interest rates begin to stabilize or should I even dare to say potentially fall as public market sentiment improves. I think the early part of 24 is going to still present challenges for the market as investors are really treading gently to see where the macroeconomic environment will go, including slower than, potentially slower than anticipated economic growth, OPEX inflation, and high interest costs. But we do expect the environment to normalize towards the second half of the year and the spigot for IPO exits to open. And certainly for assets that have a decarbonization thematic, there is a pretty strong market sentiment for those types of assets. So if we think sectorally, what types of assets are most likely to be successful in an IPO exit, it is probably assets within that sector. Let's go back to a limited partners issue. Through your experience, what are LPs looking for when they're searching for fun opportunities to deploy to infrastructure? They're typically looking for managers that have investment experience, particularly through the economic cycles. In a challenging economic environment, such as the one we're currently living in, the investors are prioritizing long-term stable returns and the ability to weather a downturn. So inevitably, turning to managers that have a proven track record, which really brings us back to your very first question, which is why has there been such a stickiness towards these former mid-market, now megafund managers of capital? It's because they have a longer track record. And that also brings us to your second question, which is how long will that track record continue to perform? We also believe that investors are looking for a differentiated approach to asset selection. From the partners group perspective, we have a thematic investing framework, which is unique in that it enables us to stay ahead of the curve in identifying higher growth niche investment opportunities. We also have an entrepreneurial governance model, which supports the execution of our strategies. But I think most importantly, having a long track record in the space and having been able to execute successfully throughout the cycles is what investors will look to when they're deploying their capital. Thank you. Let me ask you this. There was a lot written about, a lot of discussion around the denominator effect. Is the denominator effect still an effect? Yes. I mean, the denominator effect is still an effect, but we think there is light at the end of the tunnel and expect gradual improvement in 2024. As we were discussing before, the asset class infrastructure continues to attract capital on a disproportionate basis compared to some of the other private markets asset classes because of its attractive attributes and particularly because of its resilient returns in a challenging macroeconomic environment, which is incredibly important given where we have been in the last couple of years. Because it's also a relatively new asset class, we think there's been less pullback than in other private market asset classes as a result of the denominator effect. Our belief is there will be a gradual easing of the denominator effect on a relative and absolute basis, more likely to play out in the second half of the year as investors continue to evaluate and assess now that we're almost done with Q1 and continue that into Q2. So bright light at the end of the tunnel. All right. Noted. Sounds good. Last question for you. A little bit separate from everything else. Just real quick, real brief. Talk about Partner Group's approach to building value. It's going to be a theme for 24, I've been told. Building value for a platform portfolio company through recreative M&A. Sure. A major part of our playbook for value creation is platform building. And the reason we do that is we believe that we're able to capture the value differential between building a leading business and buying a fully scaled operating platform. So this typically entails identifying a business with a strong management team, a core of operating assets and a development pipeline that we can develop conviction around and then building those businesses through a creative M&A, but also through organic expansion. It comes back to what I was describing previously, growing the business organically using success-based CapEx and then making a creative add-on acquisitions at lower multiples to drive the whole multiples down. And that's where we're able to arbitrage the difference between buying a fully scaled operating business and building it. So for example, we made an acquisition in a hyperscale developer and operator of data centers in the United States a couple of years ago named EdgeCore. It had an advanced commercialization of development pipeline, had $4 billion of total contract value of long-term leases. We grew the portfolio both through efficiently designing the architecture and additional acquisitions so that we could expand its offering. And then ultimately that means that the favorable entry valuation combined with the campuses that we developed at low double-digit multiples allows new investors to buy down their multiple over time. This is the approach that we've taken consistently. It's a major part of our playbook and we'll continue to execute on it on a go-forward basis in our platform. Well, listen, this has been great, insightful as I was expecting. That's it for now. So I just want to thank our guests, our listeners for tuning in. And please, for those of you listening, don't forget to like and subscribe to Russ Rhodes Podcast and we'll see you next time.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, the news editor of Energy in the Americas for Infralogic. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest on today's program is Oscar Perez, a partner at Madrid-based Qualitas Energy. Oscar, thank you for joining the program today. Thank you very much, Andrew, for inviting me to the podcast. So Qualitas was an early entrant into the U.S. renewable space, but sold its previous investment vehicle, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, roughly a decade ago. But now Qualitas is back in the U.S. with its acquisition of Heelstone earlier this year. And I'm really looking forward to hearing about the firm's experience in and views of the U.S. renewable space. But first, Oscar, can you give our listeners a little bit of info about Qualitas, where your focus is? Sure. Qualitas Energy, it's an investment firm founded back in 2006. We have been focused on investing into the renewable energy and energy transition space since inception. We are focused in a midpoint between private equity and infrastructure investment. So we look for companies with underlying infrastructure assets in which we may apply classical private equity game plan. So buy and build growth equity or strategies to grow the company into the private equity strategies. Very interesting. And what about you, Oscar? How long have you been at Qualitas and what is your background before joining the firm? I'm founding partner of the Qualitas Energy team back in 2006. Before that, I was part of the broader Qualitas private equity team in which we spin out. We start investing in the renewable energy in 2006 and we completely independent spin out back in 2012 with the second vehicle, Vela Energy. So you've been there since the very beginning. Sure. I used to say I'm a founding analyst of Qualitas Energy. Very true. So now turning to Qualitas Energy's activities in the United States, your firm was pretty early on one of the first entrants into U.S. renewables. I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, as early as 2008, Qualitas was active in the U.S. renewable space. Can you tell me a little bit about this first round of activities in U.S. renewables? Sure. Our first entry on investment in the U.S. was back in 2008 in which we acquired subsidiary of Muni MAE, one of the MAEs in 2008 that was focused on financing and incipient a new asset class, solar distributed energy. Since the acquisition of the company, we grow and pivot the whole strategy into the creation of at that point, one of the leaders in the utility scale solar development markets. And we finally grow the company, built the first projects and sold back in 2012 to SunEdison, creating at that point the clear solar leader in the U.S. So very interesting. I'm guessing the U.S. renewable space looked very different than it does today during that first go-around. Sure. So as I pointed in the beginning, we try to find value-add spaces or companies with a specific equity game plan and underlying infrastructure. So we used to be opportunistic in the cycle and in the geographies that we enter. Back in 2008, we find that the solar industry was more advanced in Europe. We had at that point also platforms in Spain, in Italy, in different countries, and we find a very good opportunity to enter into an incipient industry in the U.S. In 2012, when we find that the value creation was in one of the big moments, we decided to exit and give entry into FRV, our U.S. platform, to a more industrial partner in order to keep on the growth during the next years. And you were, I'd say, pretty much absent from the U.S. renewables market after that for a decade. I mean, were you looking for opportunities or was the market just not interesting to you in that time frame? Because I know by around 2022 is when you really started looking again for another investment opportunity. Correct, Andrew. So since 2012 that we exit from FRV, we have been investing in different geographies and different technologies and companies. We have now 12 offices around the globe, including Germany, Spain, UK, Italy, Chile, and hopefully U.S. new coming. We find during these last years that the U.S. market was quite competitive and we do not find the correct platform and company and business model in order to apply our strategy. Back in 22nd, with the IURA approval, we find a new wave of potential growth into the U.S. market. And we were analyzing and selecting the proper platform in order to apply our investment approach. After looking at the different business models, we find in Houston all the ingredients that has been key success drivers for us in other platforms. So it was the passage of the IRA or Inflation Reduction Act, which was really a bill that mostly incentivized renewables through enhanced and added tax credits that made you give the United States market a second look? Sure. So the IRA, Inflation Reduction Act, was a regulation that really increased the potential upside and upscale of the U.S. market. The financial markets in the U.S. are quite competitive. So in general terms, it's difficult for us to find a value at niche point or blind spots in order to apply our strategies. But with the increase of the potential market in the U.S. during the next years, led by the IRA and the supportive regulation during the next years, we find that it could be a good moment in order to apply our strategies into a platform and to get advantage of these potential growth wave of the next years. So that was 2022. And I know the M&A market, especially for platform deals, was moving from very much a seller's market where these platforms were commanding huge multiples towards what I would call a little bit of disequilibrium, where there was a mismatch of expectations between sellers and potential buyers. How did you find the market when you started looking for an opportunity to invest and to return to the U.S.? I'm guessing you found some challenges since it took a year and change to find the right opportunity. Sure, Andrew. So we see a differential market environment from beginning 2022 to the moment in which we find Hillstone in the beginning of the approval of the IRA. The growth expectations was driven for a seller's market and quite competitive environment in order to be able to acquire a platform during the last months with the combination of the increase in the interest rates and the cost of capital of the operating assets combined with the uncertainties on the development process and the cues that were increasing the periods of development of the different projects. Find that was a more challenging market in which we find more comfortable to find the correct platform and find the overall combination between growth opportunities and underlying infrastructure or assets in construction or operation that we find in Hillstone. So what made Hillstone that perfect fit when you finally did find that opportunity? Yeah, Hillstone have all the ingredients that we look for a platform. So first and probably the most important, it's an excellent and first year management team with a strong track record and experience working together. Second, it's a very good combination between good infrastructure underlying assets and the growth prospects. As I told you, we try to focus on this midpoint between private equity and infrastructure investor. So we need to find our perfect match with opportunities that has meaningful infrastructure base. So need to be look under the view of an infrastructure investor, but also we are able to value the growth opportunities and the management team and the value add that may exist in the good will of a company. So the combination or the perfect combination in Hillstone of outstanding management team, a good asset base of our projects in construction and operation and a very permanent growth prospects. It's in the sweet spot of our strategy. That's very interesting and it'll be exciting to watch that develop in the coming years. What are your plans for growth through this platform? Our strategy in Hillstone is a game plan that we have followed in other platforms in other countries that it's acquiring or entering into a company that came from a developer business model. So I'll be ready to develop or acquire projects in development phase, structuring the PPA and then construction and looking for a quick flip or quick exit of the assets, pivoting into a strategy of more IPP like. So growth, the pipeline and build the projects and structuring, but with the purpose of maintain and balance it and create a company with a good underlying operating base and growth that it's an strategy or a pivotal strategy that has been success in other platforms that we invested in the last years. Well, very interesting, Oscar. Now, Hillstone is focused, from what I understand, on solar and storage, and obviously these are two exciting parts of the U.S. renewable sector, but I'm curious whether there are other renewable subsectors that are interesting to Qualitas that you might try to invest in either through this platform or separately in the future. We have different platforms in different countries of the world. Now we have a live platform in renewable natural gas in the U.K. We have a preeminent leading platform of repowering wind turbines in Germany, in the U.S. and with Hillstone. The main strategy is keep on deploying the ability and the skills that the company has shown during the last years. So focus on mid-size solar projects and batteries in both hybridization and standalone. But it's true that Qualitas Energy have a preeminent experience in different technologies that once we have a first platform in the U.S., we are going to have an eye on the different opportunities that may pop up in the interest in the U.S. market. And that was one of the main focuses of the IRA, was incentivizing some of these more nascent technologies. I'm thinking of carbon capture, of hydrogen, even of offshore wind, battery storage, of course, which is a little bit further along. Are any of these technologies particularly interesting to you from where you sit in looking for that balance between a private equity type return and infrastructure type investment? Yes, Andrew. So this kind of what we call pre-asset class, it's the kind of technologies that we always have an eye on. These technologies into the energy transition in which still are unknown by or less known by the mainstream investors and financial community are the sectors that we used to have an eye on, specifically on battery storage and flexibility assets. We have a platform in the U.K. that allow us to have experience in both development, construction and operation of the assets. And it's the kind of experience or lesson learned that we may apply also into our U.S. venture. Beyond that, new technologies such as hydrogen, renewable natural gas and carbon capture are technologies that are in our agenda of investment. And we try to find the sweet spot between the opportunities or platform geographies and support from the regulation and the technology and financial risk and return profile to find the outstanding investments that match with our investment approach. OK, good to know. And I'm definitely looking forward to keeping track of that as we move along. Now, over the last few years, the renewable industry has seen both opportunities such as the passage of the IRA and the growth that that's entailed, but also challenges. And I'm thinking here specifically not only of interest rates, but also supply chain issues and the threat of tariffs, the threat of regulatory intervention in some cases, transmission issues, other types of constraints. I'm curious, Oscar, how you view the challenges versus the opportunities that right now face the sector. How do you see that balancing out? How difficult is it going to be to build out this pipeline that Heelstone has? Now we consider it's quite an interesting moment to enter into the U.S. market on specific business models. One of the things that I also like about the Heelstone strategy, it's that they have quite an interesting approach into the different markets. So probably more focused on the mid and west and east part of the U.S. that are markets that are less intensive compared with Kaiso or AirCode market, are more classical for solar projects. So we find quite interesting the geographic or the regional spread of Heelstone. The other point that also we consider positively in Heelstone strategy is that the portfolio of projects they have developed historically, it's in line with their growth expectations or portfolio of projects that have been in development. And these projects are in the mid-size range. The portfolio, it have not a binary risks with large projects that may impact dramatically into the performance of the project, of the company, but quite diversified portfolio of projects of mid-size that give to us more interesting risk profile as a company to grow. So for you, Heelstone is really in the sweet spot when it comes to a lot of these questions. Of course. So we've been for more than two years looking for the correct and the proper investment opportunity into the U.S. market. And after deep analysis and effort, scrutinizing the different opportunities that have been in the market, we are quite happy to have pursued Heelstone and to have selected Heelstone as our platform to come again into the always challenging U.S. market. Now, Oscar, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act as one of the main drivers for you to reenter this market. And obviously when it comes to renewables and energy overall, policy support is a big question. right now that is very supportive, that pushed for the Inflation Reduction Act that has made a priority of building out the renewable sector. The polls are showing that if the election was held today, Donald Trump or another Republican would very likely be the next president and would be expected to not be as supportive of the renewable sector, although it's probably unlikely they'd be able to repeal the IRA. How they applied it might look very different. How worried are you about a change in the politics of the U.S. affecting your investment thesis? Always, the energy transition and renewable energy has a quite important component of regulatory assessment. Heelstone acquisition, it's in a moment of time that we came from an IRA or quite supportive administration into a potential change of the political environment. It's true that it's a challenge. For us, it's quite an interesting moment to reenter into the U.S. market because the challenge that may be facing during the next years is going to make the industry or the renewable energy opportunities more challenging. So on the value add and the differential of having strong and robust growth opportunities in combination with expertise and a very good management team made differential in a changing environment. So that's why also one of the points that make us to decide to enter in this specific moment with this specific challenge that make that an investor like us may provide additional value or differential value compared with, let's say, more simple periods or more simple environment that we may be facing in other moments. Well, Oscar, thank you for that. And I look forward to having you back on in a few years to see how this has played out and how the investment is going. But very exciting times both for your firm and for the for the renewable sector here in the U.S. Oscar, thank you for joining the program. I'm afraid this is all the time we have, but it was great having this conversation. And thank you again. Thank you very much, Andrew. I take note of your invitation as we evolve in our investment in Hillstone and maybe, you know, investments that we may be executing in the U.S. So let's see in a period of time.

I'm your host, Chuck Stanley, Senior Energy Policy Reporter for Infologic. I'm joined today by Alex Lung, Head of Infrastructure Research and Strategy for UBS Global. Alex is the author of the 2024 Infrastructure Outlook recently released by UBS, which finds reasons for optimism in the infrastructure sector after a lackluster 2023 that saw weak fundraising and low volumes compared to recent years due to a number of macroeconomic headwinds. Alex, thanks so much for joining us and welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to join us. If I had to sum up the recent infrastructure outlook from UBS in two words, I would go with measured optimism. I wonder if you could start off and give us an overview of the most important trends you'll be watching for in 2024. What's likely to have the biggest impact on how infrastructure markets behave in the coming year? My answer will probably surprise you because the most important trend in 2024 that I want to see, it's actually not interest rates or inflation, and it's not even elections. These are certainly important things which we can talk about later. But the most important thing I'm looking for is whether we'll see a return of what I call the animal spirits in infrastructure, which of course you're thinking that sounds pretty abstract. But what I mean by animal spirits is the positive sentiment and excitement around the asset class. Just having that healthy buzz that was really missing the last 12 months. The reason why I think that's the most important trend is because recently, we have seen this dislocation between what people are saying about infrastructure and what people are actually doing in infrastructure. Of course, there are many people in the industry like myself, who've been going around talking about the resilience of the asset class, the strong fundamentals, pricing power, inflation pass-through. I'm sure you've heard of a lot of those things. Most people don't actually disagree with us. Even if you look at all these recent investor surveys, a lot of investors seem to want to deploy capital into infrastructure. Yet clearly that isn't happening from the weak fundraising and from the lower deal flow. So that's what I mean by the dislocation, because I truly think that the sentiment has turned a little bit too cautious or even bearish with everyone just sitting on the sidelines with a wait and see attitude, despite saying they like infrastructure. And obviously with the macro environment stabilizing, I am optimistic that we're going to see that buzz return to the infrastructure markets, which translates into a healthy amount of risk-taking, making bolder decisions and the willingness to act. And of course, that also means better fundraising and more deals being done, because at the end of the day, we are in the business of taking risks and deploying capital. So that's the number one thing I want to see this year, that the conviction around the asset class actually translates into action. And we're talking about the 2024 outlook, we're obviously a few weeks into the year now. Have you seen anything so far that supports or contradicts your view or gives an indication of whether those animal spirits are coming back? Yeah, I know it's been less than two months, but I do feel like they are coming back. And obviously it's a little bit too early to get concrete fundraising or deal data. But we have seen some announcements of big tickets being raised by some funds and also some multi-billion dollar deals being announced that were closed or recently launched. And even all the headlines around M&A across the fund managers is actually a part of those animal spirits that I mentioned, right? And so I think you're feeling a little bit of a positive inflection and sentiment right now. And I think that's all very interesting, this focus on the importance of animal spirits, enthusiasm in the market, sentiment. I can see how that tracks with what the report says about long-term macro trends being much more important to the infrastructure sector than some of the short-term volatility that we've seen. I should note that we're talking on a Tuesday afternoon just after the inflation report from the labor department came in a bit higher than expected. But with that said, we do appear to be coming down from a period of significant turbulence with regard to inflation and interest rates. Would you expect to see a significant impact on deal volumes and fundraising from those trends? You're right. Since infrastructure investors have long investment horizons and even the underlying assets have very long asset lives, we do try to focus a little bit more on the long-term trends and the long-term thesis of each investment. But with that said, short-term volatility does impact us as well because like other investors, we always prefer stability and visibility. But the important thing to focus on is that we have to watch out for the second derivative or the rate of change of rate hikes that matters much more than the absolute value and also the rate of change of inflation. Again, it really matters more than the absolute value. And as long as we don't see another 500 basis points rate hike in the next 18 months, which is what we previously saw, I think we'll do just fine. So for example, as you mentioned, the inflation data today is running a little bit hot. And a lot of people in the market often like to debate about whether we're going to see three rate cuts or two or one or which month the rate cuts are going to start happening. But for me, none of those things really matter because directionally, we are already heading towards the right way. And we've had one to two years to adjust to this new normal. Earnings have adjusted upwards to the higher costs. And the big picture is that infrastructure fundamentals are still very strong because they provide essential services and they have strong pricing power. So I'm definitely not as worried as I was one to two years ago. That's why earlier I also mentioned that I'm not even that focused on inflation and interest rates right now, even though a lot of people are focused on that. And just with the relatively stable macro environment, and even with public markets being pretty strong in the last 12 months, the denominator is actually behind us and the asset class is holding up pretty well. So I do think we'll see a recovery in deals and fundraising. And in our industry, more fundraising leads to more deals, and more deals lead to more fundraising. And all the activity will only reaffirm everyone's conviction in the asset class. Again, going back to what I said about the animal spirits. And so the converse of that is if we do see less positive trends in inflation or interest rates in the coming months, would you expect that to impact that building momentum you described? Yes, going back to what I said about the rate of change of these macroeconomic indicators being more important than the absolute values. Again, we're not really seeing any big shock one way or the others. I don't think that's too much to worry about. And I think just given how the asset class has performed the last few years, I think we've been stress tested enough under different crazy economic environments that the track record alone should give investors some comfort. And perhaps specifically answering your question about whether these indicators are worse than expected. For example, one concern that a lot of people have raised is that what if inflation actually does fall and fall faster than expected? And since infrastructure performs well, when there's inflation, there's an argument that a slowdown in inflation actually hurts us because interest costs are still high. And the way I think about it is that as long as inflation is still positive, it shouldn't matter. Let's say inflation is 10% and your revenues are perfectly linked to inflation. So if you get $100 in revenues, 10% inflation means you'll get $110 in revenues. And just because inflation slows from, let's say, 10% to 2%, doesn't mean your revenues will suddenly drop from 110 to 102. It actually goes up to 112 because, again, it's still positive while your financing cost is still the same. So I'm not really that worried about it. I'm not really that worried that a slowdown in inflation is actually going to hurt infrastructure. Of course, the question is, what if inflation goes negative and it becomes deflation, then infrastructure revenues for certain will actually fall, right? And that's going to be pretty bad. And obviously, there's a question I do get sometimes too. But I think if the world does see deflation, I think we probably have bigger problems to worry about because that probably means that we're in a global recession. And interest rates will probably have to fall significantly from that. And every single asset class is going to be impacted. But at the end of the day, infrastructure is arguably still considered pretty defensive compared to a lot of the other asset classes. So again, that's where I find comfort in it. And so it does sound like what you're describing is an infrastructure sector that's already insulated to a degree from some of these trends, and that has also had a couple of years to build in some ability to absorb uncertainty and turbulence going forward. That's right. And I think the last few years, for example, a lot of people were obviously focused on inflation. And we've shown that infrastructure does perform well in an environment with high inflation. But stepping back three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, people liked infrastructure, not just because of the inflationary pass-through mechanism. It's just that infrastructure pretty much performs reasonably well in all economic environments. And again, that I think is the bigger takeaway for most investors, rather than just focusing on one single variable like inflation, which everyone was focused on the last few years. And one thing I found really interesting in the report is that, you know, you seem to suggest that there are these secular trends that really tend to support the infrastructure sector going forward. I do really encourage everyone listening to pick up this UBS report. You talk a good bit about digital trends and decarbonization really sort of being tailwinds for the sector. Are there other subsectors beyond digital and beyond sort of the decarbonization and climate sector that you expect to be particularly active in 2024? Actually, even though there are other interesting trends as well, I do want to talk a little bit more about decarbonization and even digital, because I think there's going to be a lot more interesting activity happening in sectors adjacent to these themes or less obvious sectors within these old investment themes. Just as an example, in decarbonization, what a lot of people are looking for is what's next after renewable energy, right? Because renewable energy is pretty well understood. In the last few years, it was energy storage that's become pretty hot. But what are the next areas for investments? Because we still need to decarbonize transportation. We still need to decarbonize industrials, real estate, technical futures of emissions. So I think in 2024, especially with policies like the IRA having been around for almost two years now, it's really time for all these different business models and new clean energy technologies to move away from the proof of concept stage and show that they are economically feasible and scalable. There's things like hydrogen, carbon capture, energy efficiency, sustainable fuels, virtual power plants. There's a pretty long list of things that we can watch out for. And even sectors that were previously mainstream investments that are now having a tough time, something like offshore wind, it'll be interesting to see investors are ready to step back into a subsector like that. And similarly, on the digitalization side, there was obviously a bit of hysteria and a little bit of gold rush mentality, I think, in the beginning of COVID because everyone wanted high speed internet. But the sector has faced some headwinds in the last two years. And I think there are more and more stories about overinvestments and a little bit of financial distress. And obviously, the high rates didn't help because it impacted a lot of the growth capex of these really growthy companies. So now it's really about going back to the fundamental business basics, having good and reasonable and achievable business plans and targeting attractive markets with limited competition and high barriers to entry. Again, really going back to business basics. And it will be interesting to see whether money is going to go back into these areas that are a little bit out of favor right now. And by the way, this also ties back to the animal spirits, right? Because if we have high conviction on an industry, we should see increased risk appetite. And I'm not talking about taking risks for the sake of taking risks, but just the natural evolution of infrastructure investments, kind of like how renewables became mainstream 10 years ago, how digital infrastructure became mainstream five years ago, and recently energy storage and RNG and so on. So what's next? What's the next leg of development for the industry? Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how things play out, especially in both digital and offshore wind is something we've been covering closely at Infralogic. And I'm looking forward to seeing how things play out in the coming year. I think it's going to be exciting. Another sort of tale when you talk about in the report is deglobalization. I wonder if you could speak just a little bit about how that comes into the mix in the coming year. Yeah, sure. In our report, we highlighted that there are hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of manufacturing investments that have been announced in the US and Europe. So it really is happening really quickly right now. And a lot of people think that onshoring is just about supply chain. And the instinct is to think that it's positive for local transportation networks and logistics, which is true to a certain degree. But the theme is actually much broader than that. Because remember, a lot of these new factories are being built in pretty remote areas. So I think it's actually positive for all infrastructure because a big semiconductor company isn't going to spend tens and tens of billions of dollars to build a plant without knowing that they have energy available, without knowing that the transportation network is there, and without knowing that they have high speed internet and other utility services, and essentially all the infrastructure that is needed to support the general economic growth in these regions, as well as bringing in new workforce. The whole deglobalization and onshoring trend is actually a broad sector agnostic tale when that benefits all of infrastructure. Another thing to watch out for is that a lot of these big companies that are building these multi-billion dollar facilities like the semiconductor companies, like the tech companies like Intel or TSMC, they've all made net zero commitments. So you know that they will really care about sustainability when they're building these plants. So that's another angle that infrastructure investors can focus on. And I think you can't really talk about onshoring, friendshoring, nearshoring, or any of those sort of deglobalization drivers without looking at policy. 2024 is going to be an interesting year when it comes to policy because of some major elections in the United States and the EU. I think those have a significant potential to impact the infrastructure sector. Are there some areas where investors will want to get more visibility on what the politics of 2025 are likely to look like before making major commitments? Yeah, generally I think trying to predict politics is usually a bad idea. And I think the most important thing is just really having the right contingencies in place and just seeing where the potential big policy changes can come from. And oftentimes, it really just depends on how you underwrite investments and around the assumptions that you make. And broadly speaking, though, just like you pointed out, a lot of politicians are very supportive of infrastructure, especially around onshoring or reshoring. So I think those tailwinds are still pretty strong. And at the end of the day, politics are a pendulum, always swings back and forth. And so if everyone waits for the results of every election or every midterm election before making a move, then it will become very hard to deploy any capital. Right. Well, one area specifically that you discuss in the report where we're seeing potentially a backswing is having to do with the clean energy sector. You discuss an increased political risk related to pushback against renewable energy. I wonder if you could speak to how that's going to impact the outlook for the sector going forward. Yeah, that's right. And we've definitely seen a lot more negative headlines. And certainly it doesn't help when Donald Trump goes around saying that he's going to repeal the IRA if he becomes president. But even in Europe, you're seeing the UK talk about rolling back its climate pledges. And even Germany is backing off from some of the energy efficiency targets. And as I mentioned before, there are also a lot of negative stories around offshore wind projects facing cost overruns and delays. So it is getting people pretty nervous. But in my mind, political uncertainty and policy uncertainty is not new to the clean energy industry because I've been covering the industry for almost 15 years now. And what I've learned is that we should never underestimate how resilient the clean energy industry is. Just as an example, a couple of years ago, there was a lot of doom and gloom when the US put tariffs on Chinese renewable components. And a few years before that, people were very bearish in Europe because some of the countries started getting rid of renewable subsidies. Yet time after time, the industry only kept growing and growing. And I think that's because the demand is there. Citizens are demanding cleaner energy. Large corporates are demanding cleaner energy. And so are governments. And so there is some squabbling once in a while. There's some disagreements across the industry. But for the most part, we have thousands and thousands of extremely smart people, whether they're engineers, entrepreneurs, bankers, accountants, lawyers, and even politicians who are constantly trying to figure out solutions to these new problems because the world actually wants them to solve these problems. And I think it might sound a little bit cheesy, but I think there's that famous quote that when you want something, the universe conspires to help you achieve it. And that seems to be the case for the clean energy industry because every time it takes a step back, it then moves three steps forward just simply because most of the people in the world want to see these projects being built. I don't think I'm being irrationally optimistic. It's just a track record of the industry. And so it sounds like, again, for a broader application of those animal spirits with the enthusiasm for the sector all around is kind of propelling it forward despite some headwinds here and there. Yeah, that's right. Well, Alex, unfortunately, I think that is all the time we have today. I really appreciate you taking the time to join us. And I hope you will come back and speak with us soon as we see some of these situations play out in the coming year. Thanks, Chuck. I really enjoyed that.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli, the news editor of the Energy in the Americas for InfraLogic. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest today is Will Smales, a partner and the chief investment officer for the global infrastructure manager Morrison, which is headquartered in New Zealand. Will, thank you for joining the program today. Thanks for having me, Andrew. I would imagine most of our listeners are familiar with Morrison, but just for those who aren't, can you talk a little bit about the firm's history and where its focus is in the market today? Morrison is a global infrastructure manager, and we have a team of 180 professionals across seven offices around the world. I'm based in New York. We have teams in Europe and in the Asia Pacific as well, and we just focus on infrastructure. We're deploying capital every day of the week into infrastructure assets across a number of sectors. For Morrison, our purpose is to invest wisely in ideas that matter, and that guides our investment decisions. What about you? What's your background? How did you end up working in the infrastructure space and joining Morrison? Andrew, you might detect from my accent that I grew up in New Zealand and spent many, many years in Australia. I was going to say New Jersey. The other New. For Morrison, that's interesting as well, because Morrison actually originated from New Zealand, and New Zealand is not well known for infrastructure money managers or financial managers in general. I think it's more famous for its scenery and sheep, but Morrison has grown up over 30 years, and over that 30 years, it participated very early on in the government privatization of infrastructure assets. If you go back 30 years, the assets that were being privatized by governments in many parts of the world, but particularly in Australia and New Zealand, were things like electricity networks, water networks, ports, airports, and Morrison really learned its trade by participating very early on in those industries. Sort of fast forward today, we're now spending a lot of time not only in those industries, but really thinking about the themes that drive the next wave of infrastructure investment. Unsurprisingly, two of those themes are energy transition and decarbonization, and digitization and connectivity. They're two major themes that we think about a lot, and we're investing behind. We've spoken about these themes before, and I know you think, and Morrison as an institution, feels that there's more than ever a convergence between those two, between the energy transition and the digital world today. How are those two related? How are they synergistic? How are these two sectors or these two areas converging now? To give you an example, some of the largest energy loads on the grid today are data centers. Whilst the global energy demand from data centers is only around 2%, but to put that in context, that's 460 terawatt hours, which is equivalent to the total consumption in Germany or France, to put it in perspective. Whilst energy globally for data centers is running at that level, our prediction is that it's going to accelerate dramatically. What we believe is that the world of digital investment, i.e. investing to build data centers, all of a sudden becomes closely coupled with where you're deploying your capital to build new energy generation. As we know, the lowest cost energy generation capacity to build is utility-scale solar and, in some cases, wind. How does that work on an investment basis? Instead of investing in a wind farm on the one hand and then a data center on the other, are you investing in projects that comprise both these technologies? It's really being driven by the customers. If you think the biggest customers in the world today of data center capacity are the hyperscalers. This is Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Meta, Google being the key customers in the sector. These customers have very public sustainability goals. Most of these customers have said that by 2030, they will be 100% renewable energy for every hour of every day, in fact, of every minute or every hour in each of the grids that they have facilities running. When you think about these customers saying, look, that's what we demand. As an energy developer, thinking about where you're funding new development projects, you need to be thinking about where that demand is going to be. The demand is going to be where these hyperscalers are choosing to build their data centers. That demand, as I was referencing before, we think will start increasing exponentially. Is the question more thinking about how digitization and energy are going to relate as you are looking at individual investments in each space or on a single investment basis, there has to be each of these components for a really successful investment? It's looking at both of the components. As an energy developer today, you're looking to find counterparties to purchase your power. You're looking to write power purchase agreements in the market. Increasingly, a significant portion of those power purchase agreements have been taken up by corporates. Actually, of those corporates, about 50% are the hyperscalers today. You know that if you're going to have a successful project and you want to write a contract which will allow you to secure financing to build, you need to be dealing with these hyperscalers. Actually, that's always been the case as an energy developer. To get your project up to be viable, you needed to find a counterparty for your power. I think what's changing, certainly on the digital side, is that the hyperscalers are now having regard for where their energy comes from before they make decisions about where to locate their data centers. This is because the data center demand is so significant on the grid. So if you go back 10 years ago, the level of data center demand, your hyperscaler customers might have been writing a contract for 5 megawatts. Fast forward today, these hyperscaler customers are writing contracts for 100 megawatts, sometimes more than 100 megawatts. So all of a sudden, given the amount of energy they're needing to run these data centers, they're actually having consideration for whether the grid can support that, and then ultimately where that generation capacity is going to come from becomes super important for them. So it's almost like these customers are stepping down and into the affairs of the energy developer because they want to be sure that they can get their renewable energy supply. Now, can you give any examples of investments that Morrison has made or deals that you've transacted in the recent years that really exemplify this trend, that really exemplify this convergence? We're invested on behalf of our capital, our underlying clients, which, just to recap, so Morrison manages money on behalf of large pension plans, superannuation funds, sovereign wealth, and high net worth individuals. We're entrusted with that money, and then we deploy it into investments. And some of those investments over the years have been data center providers. So we have one of the largest data center providers in the world that we are invested in and we manage. At the same time, we have renewable energy platforms around the world. Here in the US, Morrison invested capital on behalf of its clients into a business called Long Road Energy, and Long Road today is one of the largest developers of utility scale wind and solar in the United States. We have similar platforms in Europe, we have a similar platform in Asia, as well as Australia. So when we look at those investments, we're privileged to see what's happening on the data center side, and we're seeing these incredible trends of customers wanting to write larger and larger contracts for many megawatts. And we're also looking from a developer side saying, actually, where do we deploy our capital to build the next utility scale solar plant, and being able to match the two together. And increasingly, the conversations with the large hyperscale customers mean that you come to the table with both those elements. So you come to the table with the ability to build data centers, you come to the ability to give them confidence around the network capacity in the region, and also the underlying renewable generation. So it's all coming together. And the acceleration of digital infrastructure, obviously, that's not a new trend. That's something that's been happening for a while. So why now is energy playing a bigger role? Is it just because the scale of what's needed is all of a sudden, so much more dramatic? There's two really interesting trends that have been playing out for data centers. So one is if you go back 10 years ago, most corporations had their computers running in the basement. If you went to visit a corporate, you would find them locked away in the basement. And those computers were running in your in-house data centers that were incredibly inefficient. So for example, the unit of efficiency measure is this power usage effectiveness, which basically is a measure that says for every unit of energy you need to run your computers, how much extra energy do you need to keep a core or other ancillary services? And if you go back 10 years ago in an in-house data center, the power usage effectiveness could have been over two. So basically, for every unit of energy you need to run your computer, you need a whole other unit of energy to actually keep a core. And what we saw in the early phases of the transition on digital was that many of these facilities moved out of corporate data centers into centrally located data centers. And that immediately gave a power usage effectiveness improvement. So all of a sudden, instead of having a PUE of two, you might have 1.5 and now the industry is pretty much trending to 1.2 as the standard. So what that allowed the industry to do was whilst the demand for compute was increasing, actually through shifting to more efficient facilities, you found that the total usage of electricity broadly grew at the rate of GDP. As we know that energy consumption is very closely related to GDP. You found that data center consumption was broadly stable around 1.5 to 2% total load. But that gain is done. You cannot get PUEs going negative one and the rate of improvement from 1.2 towards one clearly slows dramatically if you look forward. So that win has been taken. We can't get that anymore. So if you look forward, the absolute increase in compute power cannot be compensated by PUE efficiency improvement. So we will see, therefore, a more closely correlated demand increase for power. The other trend that's really interesting is that in the computer industry, there's this famous law called Moore's law. The idea that the number of transistors you can fit on a chip will double in every two years, which basically means that the amount of compute you can get in a circuit keeps improving. What's less known is that there's another law called Cooley's law, which basically said that whilst that transistor capacity was improving, actually the energy efficiency was improving. And actually at the same time, and quite dramatically. So the amount of energy used to run a particular unit of compute was halving almost every two years, similar in the way that Moore's law was increasing the density of these computer chips. So you had a wonderful trend that allowed us to continue to increase our compute without increasing energy usage. Now that too is slowing. So Cooley's law is no longer meaning we get doubling efficiency every two years or even less than two years. And that will have a major impact on how much power we need to run these facilities. So those two trends, so the win on power usage effectiveness being done and Cooley's law slowing mean that we're about to enter a phase where we will see a rapid acceleration of energy use and energy use at the same time when renewable developers need to be thinking about these new end customers, which are the hyperscalers. So from an investment standpoint, how do you use that information to determine what makes a good investment? What makes an appropriate investment? It's really about location. So as a developer, you need to be thinking, where are you going to develop your capacity and in which grids you're going to deliver that capacity and who you can contract with to make sure that your project is viable. Similarly, the hyperscalers are thinking really hard about where they can get grid capacity and ultimately renewable energy. It's obvious that those two have to come together. So as an energy developer, you need to be understanding what the hyperscale, where the hyperscales are wanting to deploy their capacity. And as a hyperscaler, you need to be talking really closely to the renewable energy development community about where they can develop. And it's absolutely symbiotic because a large hyperscale customer providing a commitment for energy consumption can automatically trigger a bunch of renewable development around that facility because they now have the certainty and the contracting party to make those projects viable. The bit that's missing in the middle is the network, and that's probably a subject for a whole nother discussion, but the network will be key to making sure you can connect the two. Very interesting. So turning the focus to the renewable energy portion of it, I know Morrison's focused very much on the energy transition, and it's been an interesting couple of years for renewable energy. I think you saw a lot of headwinds that we hadn't seen in a long time, both from rising interest rates, which obviously affected investment across sectors, but then really dramatic supply chain issues, trade issues specifically around renewable energy. But then on the positive side, you had some tailwinds, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and some other legislative help heading into 2024, an election year with the IRA now starting to really be implemented. What's your view of the state of the US renewable energy market? Investors love certainty. In fact, investors can almost deal with any environment as long as they know what that environment is likely to be so that we can price it properly. The Inflation Reduction Act was incredibly helpful for investors in terms of giving certainty around ITC and PTCs, and that has allowed a lot of projects to be planned properly and to make progress in the market, which is incredibly important because we need more energy generation in the US market. We need to ensure we're continuing down this transition path. Certainly, if I look back to 2023 and 2022, supply chain disruption was incredibly difficult to deal with. In many cases, it meant that customers for the electricity and developers were having to sit down and work out what the new price of that electricity was. My observation as an investor watching that process, it took a while to work through, but actually a lot of those conversations were had and projects are now up and running and getting developed. You mentioned an election year, clearly policy change is difficult for folks, so you may see some investors pausing for a while to have certainty. But I think the overriding theme around energy security, energy transmission is unstoppable. So there will be many projects developed this year because they are financed and secured, irrespective of what happens on the political side. And within the renewable energy space, what opportunities excite you the most looking into 2024? We're big believers that this energy transition isn't done. So utility scale solar with storage, we're seeing through our renewable platforms globally, there continues to be huge demand for that development. So we will be continuing to put capital into our platforms to develop those large projects. At the same time, we're really interested in what's happening with alternative energies, whether that's hydrogen or other forms of energy. We have a keen interest in understanding how the aviation sector will over time decarbonize. And that means we spend a lot of time thinking about sustainable aviation fuels and how they might be able to play a role in that. But by and large, our focus is on development of utility scale. projects, as well as the acquisition of already existing operating projects. So you mentioned that the it being an election year, some folks might slow down their investment. Is it giving you any pause? We've got a very large pipeline in our development platforms. Much of that is outside of the US. So somewhat, you know, operating an environment largely independent from how policy settings here might might impact. So we will see no slowdown then. Having said that, you know, we've been investors in renewable energy in the US through the Trump administration, through a Biden administration, and we will continue to be investors through the next administration. Well, thank you for that. And then to take a step back, looking broadly at infrastructure as an asset class, obviously, you've been in the space for a long time. Morrison has been focused on infrastructure for about 35 years, if I have that right. Yeah, Morrison has been investing in infrastructure for over 35 years. So the last few years have challenged the infrastructure sector in a way that it hasn't been challenged in a long time with high interest rates. How do you think the asset class has performed? And how do you think that's going to impact how investors, how pension funds, how other limited partners are going to look at the attractiveness of infrastructure? It's really been infrastructure's moment to shine. We've been in an environment of relatively high inflation, which means we've had the response from the central banks to raise rates. You know, from an infrastructure perspective, they're great assets to own in a rising rate environment because you often have very good inflation protection. So whilst rates might be rising, your cash flows are also increasing because your revenue line protects you from the inflationary impact. We look across our portfolio. It's been an incredible performance and resilience in what otherwise is quite difficult macro environment. So I think investors should look at this period of time and say, actually, their infrastructure portfolios have performed very well when other asset classes have been incredibly volatile and really think about actually how much they want to allocate to the sector going forward. And our view, and obviously we're biased as an infrastructure investor, is actually the proportion of your total portfolio infrastructure can play an even more important role going forward. The other point to note on infrastructure, as opposed to private equity, typically the level of leverage, so the amount of debt used to acquire these assets is lower. So you haven't seen the stress on these assets due to rising rates, as you might see in other very highly levered private equity investments. Very interesting. It's definitely a trend we're going to be watching in 2024, as will a lot of these things that we've discussed today. Will, thank you so much for joining. I wish we had more time, but really appreciate you coming on and think we had a great discussion. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks for having me.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is Bill Green, the co-founder and managing director at Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, a California-based fund manager focused on the energy transition. Bill, thank you for joining the pod. Andrew, thank you for having me today. Now, we have a lot to talk about today on the climate transition, the renewables industry and what it means for an investment to be climate friendly. But first, Bill, can you give our listeners a little bit of an introduction to CAI and why you launched the firm? We were founded four years ago with a specific purpose in mind. We wanted to begin with a blank sheet of paper to address the risks and the opportunities that face the infrastructure industry as a result of the triple threat risks of the climate crisis. You see, we believe that infrastructure is the single most vulnerable asset class when faced with the climate crisis for the very reasons people enjoy and benefit from infrastructure investments. It's permanent. It's long dated. It not only has long term contracts, but these are the same features that put it at such risk in the face of the triple threat of the climate crisis. And in fact, when we began the firm, we had to invent the term triple threat risk to really define the scope of the problem more accurately. When I speak about the climate crisis, most people will think of physical risk, fires, flooding, hailstorms, of course, all real. But we believe there is more. There is policy risk and political risk. And all of this must be taken into account, which is what we do here at the firm when we consider investments in what we call climate adaptive infrastructure. We invest in three sectors in the energy, water and urban infrastructure sectors. And we can talk a little more about this later. But we believe that these sectors actually overlap much more dramatically than people realize. Well, thank you for that introduction, Bill. We're recording this today on November 27th. And in front of me, I have the newest edition of The Economist. And the lead story is the climate report card. And I'm looking at the at the headline right now, and it says some progress must do better. I thought that was kind of apt for the state of the renewable sector in the US, where for years we've seen these cross currents where you have efforts like the Inflation Reduction Act. But at the same time, we're seeing offshore wind face some real challenges. We've seen some struggles from companies like NextEra. And then we have the elections next year, where it's possible that there could be a new administration, a new Congress, and there could be the IRA could be repealed or adjusted. So Bill, overall, what do you think the trajectory is of the US renewable sector? And should we be a little bit worried? Andrew, I can tell you and your listeners unequivocally that the trend line into deeper decarbonization is well underway and is irreversible, period. You mentioned a couple of, I would call them, red herring events of late. Let me quickly contextualize those for you and take those apart. In terms of the drama with Orsted and the US offshore wind industry in New Jersey, New York, as those close to this would understand, the power purchase agreements, the contracts for the sale of that power, were agreed largely pre-pandemic with the states that wanted to develop the offshore wind. Well, pandemic, supply chain crisis, dramatic spike in interest rates. What a mess. When the wind companies went back to the states to say, what a mess, the state said, sounds like your problem, not ours. Wrong answer, in my opinion. I am predicting you will see that soon reversed. And that led to what the media has picked up on as the failure of the offshore wind industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Regarding Nextera, specifically, while they are a very large stock in the renewable indexes, they are also nothing more than a single business model that has gotten itself in trouble for failing to see around the corner of interest rate increases in supply chain. To put it simply, Nextera is a company that develops solar and wind. When the projects are developed, they, quote, drop them down into a yield entity, which is sold on the stock market. Investors by and large who bought that stock expected a stable return. Maybe they knew what they were doing, maybe they didn't. But when the interest spikes and supply chain crunch impacted the value of the projects, the top co-Nextera could no longer drop them down into the yield co-at the same price. Yield co-lowered its dividends. Stock market investors freaked out. And now you have the headlines. The point in both of these cases is we raise interest rates to slow markets down. That's the whole point of the interest rate rises. And they have impacted every business pretty much across the board. The two that have become the click bait for the pace of decarbonization that we've just spoken about are short term victims. I predict both will recover and continue to do as well as they did before the rises. But those events are based solely on their unique business model. And I'll say one more thing. The stock market is a lousy indicator of forward trends. The stock market is backwards looking, largely is quarterly results driven. And the stock market is not where we look to determine the pace and trend of decarbonization. So it sounds like a lot of these headlines that have been in the news, negative headlines, you're not too concerned about overall. How would you say that the first year, I guess, almost a year and a half now of the Inflation Reduction Act has gone? Has it spurred the increase in activity that policymakers and the industry hoped for? Absolutely, yes. Having lived through 30 years of this industry, I can tell you that nothing is as good as it sounds and nothing is as bad as it sounds. And I've seen all of the ups and downs. In terms of the IRA, very, very effective, but very selective, meaning that while casual observers might think of the IRA as a grant program, as a handout, as a subsidy, it really is nothing more than an extension of a series of tax credits, which can only be earned when your project is complete. So the catch, if you will, is you have to be a company, a developer, who can actually fill a supply chain, build a project, and then claim the credit. As a result, while everyone in the industry thought this would be a package of rainbows and unicorns, it's turned out to be extremely beneficial for those companies mature and skilled enough to use it well, and perhaps less beneficial to others who were more aspirational. There have been some implementation glitches, but perhaps the most interesting thing for us is that, according to the Financial Times and other analysts, over 80% of the money that's been deployed or allocated has gone into red states. And I would argue that this is, at least in part by design, on the part of the administration, to lock the program in place. In spite of Republican rhetoric, this is a program that is extremely well distributed in red states, and we have personally met with governors of red states who have basically said things like, my state, and I won't name names more specifically today, is going to be the hydrogen hub of this part of America, et cetera, et cetera. These are unexpected and I think quite welcome trends, notably because I think this administration knows that, you know, you win an election, you get four years, you better make sure programs like this can endure beyond that period of time. I think this one will. So, are you worried at all that a change in administration could affect the IRA, or do you think that it's built into the cake enough and has brought enough support because of that red state focus that there's not a huge reason for concern? Given what I've seen in my professional lifetime, I'm always worried. I'm worried that we're not meeting our decarbonization targets quickly enough, and I'm worried that all kinds of crazy and unpredictable things could happen, dot, dot, dot, again, right? So, I come from a position of worried, but I will also repeat what I said earlier. When Obama was elected, I sat on my couch on election night and cried tears of joy thinking that my work here in combating the climate crisis would be done. When Trump was elected, I sat on that same couch and cried tears of sadness thinking my work on the climate crisis would never be done. And you know what? Trump vowed to bring back coal and some 40-odd coal companies went bankrupt or out of business during his term. My point here is that Obama did not solve the problem as much as he was positioned to do so. Remember, we had a Democratic House and Senate and President, and Trump didn't throw us into climate hell as much as he tried. I would much prefer a tailwind than a headwind to do the work that is so critical to CAI and all of us, but I do think that some of the hand-wringing is a bit overrated because some of these things are inexorable. Let me just give you one quick example. Many of your listeners will know that there was just a strike, the United Auto Workers went on strike. Better pay, we've heard it before, same sort of thing. If you look under the covers, what you will see is that a big part of the UAW action was based on ensuring that the battery and electric vehicle factories being built largely, if not exclusively, in right-to-work states with no unions would come under the UAW union banner. These auto workers know, better than any of us, that when a combustion engine plant is shut down, there is no chance that that plant starts up again. My point is that the EV revolution and all that it will pull forward with it is inexorably underway, will not be reversed. Yes, it will have fits and starts and high interest rates, will slow car sales and blah, blah, blah, but we are not going back to combustion engines, period. When you digest that, when you think about that, you realize again why we would say directionally, we are on a journey that may not be going quickly enough and that will have fits and starts but is moving in a certain direction that will not be reversed. I guess if you've been in the industry for a long time, you're going to see changes in politics, changes in administration, and it's going to be about sticking it out through that, so that makes sense. Another big question is what role oil and gas investments can continue to play during the energy transition. We've seen a lot of traditional energy giants who are now investing in renewables, have a renewables platform, and are putting forward something of an all of the above strategy. Do you think that's a viable solution? Can we continue to build out our renewable generation while at the same time also moving forward with new oil and gas investments? Well, I'll take all the help I can get as a starting point, so certainly any honest broker who enters the conversation and attempts to advance the things that we work on, the energy transition, the water transition, urban infrastructure, data centers, and the like is welcome. I think the complexity, perhaps the challenge, is when you dig a little deeper, who is doing this because they really have leaned in and are doing it seriously, and who is doing this so that they can put something up on the website or on the television that says, X, Y, Z, we are part of the solution, not the problem. And I think you will find that there is a wide range of truth when you look more deeply into this. I read a statement from an oil executive the other day who had announced quite publicly their commitment to carbon capture and sequestration, and who was then recorded privately saying something to the effect of, hey, federal government's going to put a bunch of tax credits out there, and I'm going to be the first to get them. Not that I believe in carbon capture and sequestration, I believe in money. So it does make one wonder what lies behind the rhetoric. I will say that at our firm, we do not engage in opportunities that are adjacent to the oil and gas industry. We've been approached to make investments in what is called blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture, allegedly. We have not and likely won't do anything like that. We believe that there are ample opportunities that steer clear of the risks of being caught in the fossil fuel trap. We believe that fossil fuels are inherently challenged around profit, and while we understand that people will invest where they see fit. So in closing on this point, our firm has elected not to invest in the adjacencies of oil and gas and the transition. We believe there are plenty of opportunities to continue to work in what I would call more of a pure play fashion to ensure that the transition continues. So Bill, you do have in your portfolio one peaker plant, the Sentinel Energy Center, that some would see as more of a traditional asset. How did you find that that fit into your firm's outlook and your firm's focus on the energy transition? Perfect question. So there's an example of a pure play transition investment in which we studied the CAISO system, the California ISO system, made a determination that peaker plants currently, as you say correctly, run on natural gas, are an indispensable part of the system. You see, batteries can be charged and discharged for four hours. Four hours may not cover the intermittency that is created by the massive infusion of wind and solar into the CAISO system. So the peaker plants are and will always be an integral part of the system. So it's a question, if they run on natural gas and we want to move away from that, what to do? So we, along with our partners, identified the Sentinel Energy Center as one of the most critical peakers in California because it sits in Palm Springs and it backstops at this point 12 gigawatts of intermittent wind and solar. We purchased it and we are converting it to run on green hydrogen. So this is a great example of an asset transition strategy. The purchase was made from day one based on the introduction of green hydrogen. We are beginning that work today. It will come in in tube trucks as opposed to through the pipeline. But our gas supplier, Southern California Gas, has announced that it is on a trajectory as well to be supplying green hydrogen to its key customers, one of which would be Sentinel. So you see, we didn't buy it to operate it as a gas peaker. We bought it to operate it as one of the first peakers to be on a full pathway to renewable energy using green hydrogen. And what timeline do you expect that to take place? We've already designed the test protocols. We're working with the Air Resources Board to make sure that when we do introduce green hydrogen, we'll be compliant with all of our permits. So this work is imminent. All right, great. Well, thank you for that, Bill. And I wanted to go back to something you said earlier. You mentioned the case of one energy CEO investing in carbon capture and then later saying privately, well, I don't care about the green benefits. I just want to take advantage of these incentives. But is that a bad thing? I mean, if policy is correctly designed, shouldn't we be focusing on an alignment where the best financial interest of investors is going to align with what's good for the energy transition? Isn't that in the end going to be more effective than counting on people really just caring intrinsically about the environmental benefits of their projects? The problem is a math problem. If all of the oil companies that exist today take their identified reserves out of the ground, temperature on the planet Earth will rise well beyond any safe limit. So the dilemma, you see, is how to manage the remaining reserves of oil and gas held by for-profit companies when each of them says, I have a right to do what I need to do for my shareholders. This is in a way, and I don't want to get too philosophical in the short time we have, this is a problem of the commons. You see, each company, while privately owned, can do what it wishes to do for its shareholders. But taken in the aggregate, it is a non-sustainable path. So in the short time we have left, I would simply say that the more quickly we can transition into a sustainable, low-carbon energy, water, and urban infrastructure ecosystem, the better off we will be. Well, thank you, Bill. We've spent a lot of time on the energy side of your business, which is fitting since I think a lot of our listeners come from that part of the sector. But I wanted to spend a little bit of time, of the remaining time we have left, on data centers because that's also a really interesting investment when it comes to how it affects the climate and the energy transition. Data centers are obviously a huge part of our lives moving forward as there's more and more data to store. At the same time, they use a lot of energy, which isn't ideal. You're involved in data center businesses. How do you make sure that these aren't having a negative contribution when it comes to the energy transition and how do you position those investments? Yeah, it's a fascinating subject, right? With the Internet of Things and AI becoming ubiquitous, we will inevitably use more and more energy data centers. So for a long time, and a little bit of background on this, data centers were considered by the investors who invested in them to be sort of a real estate investment. Yeah, it was a building with four walls and you had a tenant, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and you collected rent. I'm oversimplifying. When we looked at this, we said, wrong. If a data center sells 80% of its product being electrons, if 80% of the money moving through a data center, whether it's a pass-through to the customer or supplied, irrelevant, is an electron, you are in the climate-adaptive infrastructure business. And by the way, of the remaining 20%, 10% or 15% of that can be water used for cooling. So we began this conversation with some of the largest owners of data center infrastructure, and they, surprisingly, were on a similar path and began to understand that not only capacity constraints to obtain power in certain geographies, but the client demand would drive them to become more and more renewably powered and sustainable. Now, what's interesting about that is a lot of what's going on in the trend towards deep decarbonization, as we've spoken about earlier, is demand-driven, is client-driven. That could be me, as a resident of California, switching to a CCA, which is a community choice aggregator or, in effect, a private utility that offers to sell me more green power. There are a lot of those in California, including in Marin County, where I live. Or it could be Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, demanding of their data center hosts that they provide 100% green power with additionality. And I'll come back to that in just a moment. We had a meeting of the minds with some of the largest data center owners and operators. Our investment is in one of the most sophisticated data centers on the planet, which is 100% renewably powered today, but is also growing very rapidly. Therefore, their need to continue to source green power is growing exponentially. That's where our firm comes in, by helping them obtain that green power, whether it's through our hydro resources or through our solar and wind resources or through our storage resources. The sector has pivoted, and I think not a moment too soon. I think you will see, in the next year or two, a virtual sea change towards 100% renewably powered data centers. I mentioned additionality. This is the complexity. It is possible today to green your business, any business, data centers included, by buying a green credit, a renewable energy credit or green credit of some sort generated by someone else. What more and more sophisticated customers are demanding is not that you purchase a credit that has already been created and exists on the market, but that you use your dollars to directly create additional renewable energy. Hence the term additionality. This is actually excellent for our industry because it's creating more and more demand for new products, new projects that are purpose-built to serve these massive energy and water consumers. Something to watch. Well, thank you, Bill. That is very interesting. A lot more we could cover, but I think we're just about out of time. So, Bill, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I'll have to have you back on someday to cover water investments too. Well, let's not make it too long. I look forward to it. Andrew, you're an excellent host and thank you for your time. Well, thank you again, Bill. And thank you for tuning in to Crossroads.

Welcome to the latest edition of the InfraLogic Crossroads podcast, where I, Emma Pigram, will be speaking to some of the most influential women in the infrastructure and energy space about their views on market trends in a new crossroad segment, Women in Infrastructure. I'm honored to be joined today by two powerhouses in Brazil's oil and gas sector, Daniele Valois and Gabriela Bezerra-Fisher from law firm Trench Rossi. Thank you so much for joining me today. And I would just love for you both to give a brief introduction into yourselves, into the women behind the lawyers. Hello, Emma. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I'm Daniele Valois. I have been practicing in the energy market, mostly in the oil and gas market for the last 24 years. Since the opening of the Brazilian upstream market. And since then, I have been actively working on key projects for the development of our country together with multinationals and also our national oil company Petrobras. And it has been a rich experience for me and for our firm to take part of this important moment of a developing country as Brazil in such an important area, which is energy. So our experience grew as Brazil grew for the past years. And I'm really proud of being part of our history and have always been contributing not only to the projects that our clients have been engaged locally and internationally, but also the policymaking, which makes quite a lot of difference in the projects that we have been working in the past two decades. So I'll pass the word to Gabi Bezerra, who has been also working in this area for many, many years. Thank you, Dani. Thank you, Emma, so much for the invitation. It's an honor to be here today. So my name is Gabriela. As Dani mentioned, I have been working on the energy sector for over 10 years now and also historically more focused on the oil and gas sector. But nowadays also as we all are looking at the energy transition as well. So I have been focusing a lot on hydrogen, on carbon capture, on the carbon market. So we have been assisting our clients to navigate on this energy transition landscape as well. We are a law firm based in Brazil, we're also in cooperation with Teco McKenzie, present in several jurisdictions around the world. So we have a very complete experience in terms of projects and policymaking around the world in this area. So it's a pleasure to be here today talking to you and discussing this very interesting topic for us. About the woman behind the brand that we're referring to, I'm married for over 20 years. I am 45 years old. I have three boys. One is 19, who is studying at Wake Forest, North Carolina in the US. The other one is 15 and the other one is 13. And I have two Rottweilers and dogs and a lot of entertainment at home as well and challenges in addition to the highly challenging world that we live in the professional aspects of our lives. So I just wanted to add a personal piece of our talk. For myself, I'm also married for eight years now. I have two kids, small kids, a boy who's three years old and a girl who is one and a half and also two step sons. So I have teenagers, babies and the very, very full house. So this is also the woman behind the lawyer here. Wow, amazing. Well, thank you. Congratulations on surviving firstly three teenage boys for one and for surviving 20 or eight years of marriage. That's amazing. So now moving on to our first topic. So I'll start quite broad. So with countries moving into greener energy, do you see the oil and gas market slowing down in Brazil? I think the answer is no. I think that the production is increasing. We have pre-salt, which are gigantic reserves that are now producing full speed and already represent over 70% of the production in Brazil. But we usually see the oil and gas and the fossil fuels as a window. So a window that is obviously closing. So there is a shift in how fossil fuels are being considered around the world and how we are treating these in the energy transition landscape. But it's not something that will end tomorrow and it's not something that is supposed to be necessarily a full shift from one to the other. The idea is of a transition. So the idea is that the fossil fuels and the oil and gas sector will live together with the renewables and complement so that in the long shot, we have a transition from being dependent on these fossil fuels to have it complement where it is strictly necessary. So Brazil is a very big country. We have a lot of reservoirs. We have a lot of natural resources and the production is ongoing and increasing. But we do see that not only the investors are taking decisions to move, even the oil and gas companies, to move from being an oil and gas company to an energy company and also environmental concerns. We have a discussion here in Brazil around the equatorial margin where there were big discoveries in Guyana, which is very close to Brazil, but the authorities have not granted the environmental licenses for that area here in Brazil. So I think things are moving. I don't see the operations and the activities slowing down right now, but it's a trend for the future for us to be able to complete this transition. And just to add, I think it's not exclusive to Brazil. I think the world won't stop using fossil fuel for the long term or even the midterm. All the infrastructure that is in place counts with fossil fuel. We know that although R&D investments are being made to cheapen or to lower the cost for the production of cleaner sources of energy, they are still high. And there is a petrochemical industry that we cannot forget. And I think when we look into energy transition, we always look, knowing more deeply the market, we always look into a complementary role of energy transition as opposed to an immediate or midterm or even long term replacement of fossil fuel. And especially, Emma, considering that we in Brazil, and this is the case of LATAM, we are a new region. We are a region that is under development, different from countries who have benefited from the impact of industrialization for a longer time. Brazil is a new country, like all LATAM countries are new. So we are still building our country and energy and fossil fuel, cheaper energy will always be required for the development of a new country. So not only from the perspective of supplying to the world the fossil fuel, which is our potential because of the magnitude of our reserves, but also because we need that for our industrialization process. Some specialists talk about new industrialization, meaning that Brazil will take advantage that it is implementing its industrialization process in the middle of the energy transition, and we could potentially use clean energy for this process. But we know that a lot of R&D investment must be done, especially to use cleaner energy in scale, and this might take a while. And just on that, with these transitions happening at the same time, I know you said that it's not going to be in the short term or the mid term, it will be in the long term. What is this long term? How long do you think that will be before we do start to really move away from fossil fuels? Yeah, this is a one million dollar question. I think my generation won't be seeing a clean energy world. I think at least for the next 40, 50 years, I don't imagine a world totally clean. In parallel, I see a technology developing. Technology is magic. So we never know what can happen and what disruptive technology could be implemented in one year from now or in the near future. The factor that makes me consider that this will take a while is the fact that the world has developed an infrastructure consider fossil fuel and the changing of it might be burdensome. Of course, that if we consider hydrogen, for instance, it's possible to mix hydrogen to gas and use the existing pipelines. And this is a debate that we'll be having on a case by case basis. But this is a difficult question to be answered. I think that at least for the next 30 or 40 years, this won't be totally replaced. I think complementarily, the world will be using cleaner energy. Companies will be positioning themselves more and more towards clean energy. I see already some institutional investors deciding not because of business reasons, but because of political and reputational reasons not to invest even in natural gas unless there is a combination of the investment of natural gas with biomethane or cleaner gases or hydrogen. So I see a lot of debate about political versus business decisions. And when we indeed look into the business scenario, I think the replacement, the full replacement will take a while. I don't know if Gabi totally disagrees, but I think at least for the next 30 years, we will still have fossil fuel around us. The part that I mostly agree with is the fact that it's the one million dollar question. I think that that's the point. Of course, we are all looking at net zero. And it's important that we have all these commitments from the countries and the companies and that we see that they are serious about it and that actions are being taken. But as Danny mentioned, there are infrastructure costs, challenges that still need to be overcome. And also, as I mentioned, it is a transition, so it's not something that is going to happen out of the blue. But I think I like to think that we are progressing and and that we will achieve these goals. Yeah, we also need to think a lot on the petrochemical industry because we talk about no fossil fuel. But if we have no fossil fuel, we have no tire as well. There is no plastic. There is no everything that we do in our day to day nowadays. I know bioproducts are being developed even in the universities of Brazil. And this is a involvement that we see as well. But even asphalt, I was talking to a client who is trying to develop asphalt from the remaining parts of of rice. But this is still under technological development. But today we do use fossil fuel for pretty much everything that we do. I think there are R&D and the government, the Brazilian government and the various governments around the world are encouraging companies to invest in R&D for the decarbonisation of their activities and the greening of their supply chain. But this is a process. I think we are in the early stage of this process. There will be companies who will be the protagonists of this debate. And my personal bet would be that the national oil companies, the NOCs that explore and produce crude oil, natural gas in certain jurisdictions, are the companies with the natural driver for investing in projects that benefit the planet because they have this dual role of security, dividends and profitability over their projects, but also because of the state status. They also need to look into the social environmental aspects of the nations where they have been incorporated. So Petrobras, I think, should and will be one of the protagonists, at least in Latin America. I see Ecopetrol already investing in the energy transition in hydrogen, for instance, because they have the legal duty to secure that as well, in addition to securing dividends and also profitability in its projects. And they have the incentives of development banks and the governments to invest in R&D as well, considering the risks involved, because their ultimate goal is to benefit the common interest, the society where they have been incorporated. That's really interesting. And it's very creative as well. I mean, using something like rights sounds very, very creative. And I think staying on a more on the political side, we're obviously almost a year now into Lula's government. And do you believe that green energy is one of Lula's main focuses? Yes, definitely. We have been seeing a clear shift in this scenario from the previous government to the current government. So the Lula government has taken a very strong position that energy transition is a priority of the government. Lula even said that Brazil could become the Middle East of the energy transition if we compare it to oil. So the government has launched several programs towards the energy transition. So Fuel for the Future, for instance, which is a project that is focused on biofuels, on sustainable aviation fuels, and also on e-fuels as well, synthetic fuels. We see an acceleration program that will invest in terms of public and private investments over R$1 trillion, which is the PACI, the new PACI, so the new acceleration program of the government. And the energy transition projects have a very big portion of these projects, including hydrogen projects. The government has created internally an energy transition arm that is 100% focused on this. So this has definitely been in the agenda. And also in Congress, we have recently debated the carbon framework, the hydrogen framework, the carbon market regulated framework is also being discussed. So this is a clear shift. And we have been seeing very clear signals that the government will go in this direction and invest in the country's potential in this area. I think this is also true for Petrobras, as Danny was mentioning, that now has an area that is focused on energy transition. So the trend of the oil companies around the world shifting from an oil company to an energy company. I think in Brazil, we have all possible resources, we have pre-salt, high quality oil, associated gas in volume now, especially with the pre-salt production. We are a green country, meaning that we have land, meaning that we also have a good portfolio of areas where the agroenergy projects can be implemented. Hydrogen is also a huge potential, even natural hydrogen. There are now debates in Brazil that there is a big potential for natural hydrogen in our country. So if we look into the various solar, wind, nuclear, if we look into the various sources of fossil fuel, intermediate natural gas and green energy, Brazil has it all. I think the challenge is that we are a developing country. We are regulating the various areas that are important to the world as we speak. We are nowadays, later on in the process, while compared to Europe and other parts of the world, we are only nowadays regulating and opening the Brazilian gas market. We have a new law that is being regulated now. We hope that the government takes the advantage that we are regulating the new gas law and also include into the agenda or considers while regulating the new energy so that we won't lose the window of this regulatory process. But we are changing the wheel while the car is running. So it's a process, I think, natural for developing countries, but all the resources are there. So I think with the Lula government, there is now a clear message that Petrobras will be investing in all these new energies that we are debating. Petrobras is one of the most important companies in Brazil and in the world in terms of energy. They are operating not only in Brazil, but also in other countries. And they can be a standard center because they have a technological center that is internationally known. And we are really proud of Petrobras. And we believe that we could make the change in the old world scenario of energy transition. Petrobras now is starting to look to green hydrogen as well. And I know that you mentioned hydrogen as well in terms of it's now in debate for legislation and for guidelines and that kind of thing. And I think based on the policymaking and advocacy work that you have been conducting in the past years in the energy transition landscape, especially hydrogen, do you see Brazil becoming a leader in Latin America for hydrogen? There's a study from Roland Berger that says that Brazil could reach $600 billion in investments in green hydrogen by 2050. And do you think that could be feasible? Yeah, I think so. Definitely. In Brazil, we have a law, which is the economic freedom law that states that whenever technology is not yet mature enough to be converted into a law that regulates its development, even though you are not forbidden to conduct pilot projects and implement projects involving that technology just because of the mere fact that that technology has not yet been regulated. So companies can implement green energy projects, including hydrogen projects by the fact that we do not have nowadays a regulatory framework that specifies or certifies and regulates more in detail hydrogen. So there are various views of laws in the discussion. We are actually contributing quite active in all those discussions via our clients, via sectorial associations. I am today because of the engagement of Trento Rossi and Baker McKenzie in the policymaking debate of hydrogen around the world. I have been designated as the new Director of Institutional Relations of the Brazilian Association of Hydrogen. And Gabi's working together with me in all the activities that we do there. And we have been actively contributing to the various views of laws in the discussion. One important point is that the governments, they need to be conscious that the legislation of the green energies nowadays, and not only the green energies, but the carbon credit market or all the legislation of issues that benefits the planet, they need to be harmonized. And this is a challenge that we see when we evaluate the legislation that are emerging in each country, because we could have European companies investing in the development of hydrogen projects in Brazil, which would be then converted into ammonia and exported to Europe. And the specifications of what the low carbon hydrogen is to be considered must be harmonized. Otherwise, the world would not be trading globally those new potentially new commodities that will come up after the energy transition becomes more mature. So we are really conscious about that. And in all contributions that we do, we have these in the back of our minds, not only the hydrogen sector, but carbon capture, we together with our sustainability team have always also been contributing a lot with the views of law on the regulated carbon credit market as well, which follows the same rationale. And I think if Brazil manages to not invent something completely apart from the world, which we as a firm and many important players are trying to secure, I think will play an important role and create a sustainable energy transition economy out of Brazil, potentially contributing to other nations which do not have the green landscape that we do in Brazil. Yeah, and kind of following from from that, as you mentioned, possibly harmonizing legislation and what is clean hydrogen globally, and Europe is currently really, really looking for imports of green hydrogen. And so they would be a big market. But since the war broke out in Ukraine, and Europe has really quickly been looking to move away from Russian oil and gas, what kind of impact has that had on the Brazilian market? I think in Brazil, we do see an increase in the exportation, the exports of oil trying to flow into Europe, because of course, of the of the of the war and the sanctions against Russian oil and Russian oil products. We also in internally, we also had an increase in imports of Russian diesel in Brazil, because all the Russian products are either under severe sanctions or under price cap limitations. So they are becoming interesting for importation as well under these cheaper prices. But I think that in general, the war has brought the world's attention to what we call the energy trilemma, so that we should be looking, of course, as sustainability at cost, but also at security, energy security. So it's, it's not something that we should be focusing on only shifting to renewables and, and reducing the carbon footprint, but we're still talking about the world's energy supply so that it has become very clear to Europe that relying on the on the Russian gas is dangerous. And so we have been seeing all this movement with repowering you and etc, to move away from this dependency. And of course, this creates opportunities for other countries that as it happens with Brazil have the national national resources and the infrastructure to be the supplier of these alternatives to the Russian gas. So I think that for Brazil, this represents an opportunity. And we have been seeing in the hydrogen scenario, the in Brazil, we have reports being focused on developing these hydrogen hubs, so the PSEN port, the SUAPI port, the ASU port. And although there are a lot of projects being announced, a lot of MOUs, and these are still projects that are in initial phases, study phases, but we do think that these are probably the port projects are probably the ones that will move faster, because they can, they have more possibility of accessing these international funding alternatives as Germany has released, for instance, funding for hydrogen projects outside Germany. So we do see these as a potential trend, at least to kick off the market, although Brazil also has a very big internal market that would be would benefit from the hydrogen being produced here as well, or fertilizers, for instance, for mining sector, for the mining sector as well. So yeah, I think that hydrogen is definitely promising. We still have challenges to overcome, but I think that Brazil can benefit from this reality, this new reality that Europe is worried about energy security as well. And just to add one interesting piece of information, since in Brazil, we don't have the full capacity of production of byproducts, and considering the sanctions that the world is imposing to, for instance, the Russian diesel, and the price caps that have been implemented, we import diesel, and nowadays, at least until a few weeks ago, I think the circumstance changed recently, but we were importing great percentage of the diesel that we are consuming in Brazil, we were importing from Russia, because of the price that the diesel was available in the market, and the fact that we do not have entirely the capacity to refine the crude that we have in our country. That's the point of being a developing country, you have the resources, but you don't have entirely the infrastructure, and some interesting situation come up because of these dual scenarios, I would say, because we make jokes here in Brazil that we are first world, second world, third world, developing world in the same country, although we have this huge potential for exporting all the products we can have. From time to time, we have a shortage on important products that we need in our country, that's the challenges of a country in development, just like Brazil, so I just wanted to make this comment as well. I really love the way that you phrase it as well, I really like the way that you describe Brazil as, you know, it's in the developed world, it's developing, and I think that's so interesting, and that's such a great way to look at a country like Brazil, which is a, it's huge, and has an abundance of resources, an abundance of intelligence, but is still developing in that way, and I think that's quite a nice way, really, to start to wrap up this podcast, but just before the end, and there's one thing that I would definitely kind of like to touch on with you, because this is our first Women in Infrastructure podcast, and there is something very, very interesting that I think about the firm that you work for, which is that Trench Rossi is a 58% female law firm, and has won awards for its gender equality and majority female leadership, and I was just wondering, is that something that you've really seen grown in the firm from your time there, and have you seen a change with that in the firm, and how do you like working in a firm like that, that is majority female? It's amazing. We are like that because we had inspirational women who were in leadership positions since I was a junior associate, a law clerk, Gabi had the same experience. It's really challenging to be a woman, especially in the oil and gas sector, which historically has been composed predominantly by men over 40, white men, so this has been challenging over the past years. We see, with the energy transition, a change, a diversification of the people who are now working. We see more female leadership in the energy transition, which makes us really happy to see, but I think the important point for us was looking into people who were in leadership position and knowing that they made it, and they were successful, and this brought us the strength to overcome the challenges and know that at the end of the day, we would become stronger, and I think this is my trajectory. I'm really proud of it because there were moments when I thought I wouldn't be able to make it, especially when I had my first child, and I had to return to work, suffering, leaving him at home. When I had my second child, when I had my third child, when I had to travel for meetings abroad when they were so small, and there wasn't the technology that we have today where we could look into their faces by video and talking to them, we didn't have much knowledge as well on how to deal with this absence because we are a new group of women. I think my generation is probably one of the first generations of women whose wage are equal to men's wage and the performance levels are equal to men's performance level, and this was a challenge. There was a lot of suffering, but I think the main topic is that we look for women who were there in the leadership positions and they inspired us, so I think that's what made me go and not to stop and rethink my career. Yes, I agree with Dani, and I can say that she inspired me as well. Well, thank you so much Daniele and Gabriela for wrapping up on such a positive note, all about inspiration. Thank you so much again for joining me today and for a really insightful discussion on the oil and gas sector in Brazil. Please join us again soon for the next episode of Infralogic's Crossroads podcast. This is me, Emma Pigrim, Senior Analyst for Infralogic, signing off.

Today, I welcome our guest, Chris Stott. He's the CEO and founder of Lone Star Data Holdings, a company which is investigating the possibilities of deploying cislunar services. We're talking about space technology today in the telecom sector. Chris, thanks for joining the podcast. Oh, Jonathan, thank you very much for having me. Pleasure to be with you today. I don't think I've covered in my role in the nine years with the company, data centers which are based in space. We don't cover a lot of space infrastructure, but it's certainly very interesting. And I can see that there's a lot of movement in that direction. Perhaps you could start off by telling us a little bit about what is Lone Star Data Holdings, and what does the company aim to do? No, well, thank you. Excellent question. So we think of ourselves as Lone Star. Well, let's take a step back. What we do is we look at the two most important things today, being us, humanity, you and I, our friends, our families, our colleagues, our societies, and as a close second, the data that we create as a species. And we look at the importance of that data to our technological civilization. And then we look at the threats to that data. And it's our goal is to save humanity's data one byte at a time from the ultimate backup location, which we see as Earth's largest satellite, the moon, and do so leveraging satellite communications technology, information technology, and bringing the best of Silicon Valley and the space sector together to do this, to accomplish this. It's a very interesting concept, Chris. We've talked about this previously, but tell our listeners a little bit about why the moon is an appropriate place to situate data centers. Yeah, absolutely. Because, look, I understand it sounds like lunacy when you first hear about this data centers on the moon. But of course, we're doing backup, premium product, to secure storage, to complement backup down here on our planet. So we were approached back in 2018 by a series of customers who came to us with a very unique problem set. They said, we must secure and store our premium data. It's regulated data. We operate internationally. We are facing questions on data sovereignty. We're also at the same time facing questions on the security of our networks. We're facing network intrusion. We're facing natural disaster, climate change, human error. And we need somewhere to protect our data. We need to store it in a safe, accessible, and sovereign manner. That's the problem set that we went off to solve for them. So this is demand to pull as opposed to technology push, because we're using existing technologies to do this. So we looked underwater at data centers. We looked at jungles, deserts, underneath mountains, on top of mountains, everywhere. But of course, anywhere on our planet is subject to all of these problems. Network intrusion, malware, ransomware, natural disaster, climate change, and worse, and nation state actors and more. So we started to look outside of the planet. We looked at satellites in low Earth orbit. And by the way, data centers exist in space. Starlink is an incredible program out of SpaceX, where every Starlink satellite has 40 Linux servers on board. Starlink is, in essence, a distributed data center in the sky for satellite transport and data transport layers. Same thing with OneWeb. Same thing with Project Kuiper, which is the Amazon competitor to Starlink. And Lightspeed, too, from Telesat that was announced last week in Paris. Data centers and pushing data around in space has been around for a long time. But storing data in space, away from the natural disasters and human-made disasters on the planet. So we started looking at low Earth orbit. We looked at geo. We could go through a raft of reasons why, yes, no, costs, et cetera. And then we started to look at Earth's largest satellite, the Moon. And we started to look at the orbital mechanics, the viewpoints, the use of solar energy so we could actually generate carbon credits. We're incredibly clean in what we're doing. The use of natural cooling to cool down our devices is tremendous. It's pretty cold in space. It's a wonderful thing. So when we look at the classic cost of a data center, the cost of powering it, cooling it and communicating with it, when you apply satellite technology to that and the environment of space and the incredibly unique environment on, above and below the Moon, it's tremendous. The Moon is so good for this, Jonathan. If it wasn't there, we'd have to build it. It's really fascinating, Chris. And you've mentioned several different aspects there that we can talk about a little bit further. But essentially what you're saying is that the location for clients is often an issue for data security purposes. The location of a data center is also important in terms of how expensive it would be to cool it and to produce electricity for it. So this is really a kind of technology and an initiative that looks to solve many different problems at the same time. Tell us a little bit more about some of those data restrictions in terms of where people can locate data. No, well, thank you. It goes down to data sovereignty laws. Over 104 nations have that now. And even states within those countries have that. So you think of a data localization, data residency. It's where regulated data cannot legally be stored outside the boundaries or outside the border of your country. For example, American data can't be stored outside of America, no matter how good the data center overseas is. So you must do this within terms of your sovereignty. Now, high seas, maybe, but space, absolutely. We have, gosh, 30 years of precedent and satellite law, space regulation, spectrum regulation, where you can actually do data sovereignty. You can have one satellite owned and flagged and licensed by one nation flying articles and equipment for a third nation under their law. So data sovereignty works in space. And up and around the moon, it works even better. Under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, all the way through the Liability and Registration Conventions and the Artemis Accords today, the moon is not sovereign. So when you land on the moon, say you land an American lander on the moon, which is about to happen, by the way, in November, the first one, Intuitive Machines, is leading the charge back for the United States. Fantastic company, tremendous people. India landed on the moon about three weeks ago. The Japanese are about to land another mission on the moon as we speak, Jonathan. So the moon is getting a very busy place. So you land an American lander on the moon, that's like landing Washington DC on the moon, literally. You don't own the moon, but where you land, you have jurisdiction and continuing regulation and supervision of. And if you have, say, a Japanese rover on that American lander, it's like the Japanese embassy on that lander. If you have a box of electronics from us, it's like having whatever country we license it through. And so the case, the legal case for doing this is the first question we ask, can we legally do this? The hardest thing about getting to space is getting permission by far. And it's, you know, people think of the rocket science, which is legit, and they think of the science behind the satellites and the storage devices, which is also legitimate. But the hardest thing is getting permission. So you must legally be able to do this. And we've checked those boxes. More so, we've worked that through with regulators, we've worked that through with major law firms on both sides of the Atlantic, and it works. 30 years of case precedent. So that's how we handle the sovereignty issue. But it's a never growing one. California just passed in GDPR. I believe the state of Florida is about to pass its own. So you've got states within states now having these questions of data sovereignty. It's a huge thing as we go forward for anyone involved in the industry. Fantastic. Talk about the clients and why they would need to store their data somewhere like this as well. I know you probably can't say too much about who the clients are specifically, but what kind of needs do they have? And what kind of data of theirs are you planning to store in these lunar data centers? No, well, thank you. And this is all demand pull, as opposed to technology push. So we're acting on behalf of the market. And this is a premium market. This isn't available to everyone just yet. So the clients we have on both of our test flights, we have a test flight in November with Intuitive Machines, and we're on their second mission in February as well with Intuitive Machines. We're the world's first ever data center off planet. And both of those missions are sold out. The capacity is booked. And we're now looking at a series of missions in 2025 in orbit around the moon. And those missions are starting to fill up too. We have hit something in the market where we're hitting these unique paying point. And a lot of the customers are under non-disclosure. So please forgive me if I don't delve into who they are and what they do, because that's their business. And think of us like a banker in that regards. That's their business, not ours. I can though, and one public customer that we have who has been tremendous, very avant-garde, looking at the future, looking at their future needs, and looking at how they protect the data of their clients. And that's the state of Florida. They have been tremendous as a client. We're the first of 50 states to look at something like this. And you think, well, why would Florida want to do this? Well, how many hurricanes hit Florida? It's a pretty huge state. It's about the size of Great Britain, if not bigger. And we have how many million of people living here? And the state of Florida are excellent custodians of that data. And they see the risks. They see what's happened in Louisiana with hurricanes and damage to data centers and data loss. So they are looking at the future. They're saying, right, we need to do this. We need to protect our data going forward. Jonathan, here's the other element. We kind of gloss over this in our industry in a good way, right? How much data is created, new data, every day by the human race? We now have figures. It's 2.5 quintillion bytes of information a day. That's about 1,000 petabytes a day, new, every day. That's 365, well, 3.6 million. See, that's why I have a CFO on the math. That's a lot of data created every year. And more than half of that is regulated data. And that data, that labeled data, is doubling every two years. It's an exponential growth in the data that we create as a species. And it's the most valuable thing that we have, more valuable than oil, more valuable than gold. And yet, it's incredibly fragile and agile. And then how do we back that up? And by backing it up off planet, we do something that dinosaurs could never do. As Larry Niven said, the dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program. We've never had this opportunity before. We've never been able to do this. It's only because of the Artemis missions and this huge return to the moon by America and its allies, by Russia and China and their allies, sadly, Team Tyranny, we call them. But Team Freedom is quite the package going forward. $93 billion worth of investment in infrastructure. At Lone Star, we see ourselves as a customer, a user of all of that infrastructure. You know, we're like an airline. We don't build the plane, but we buy it. We don't build the engines, but we use them. And we lease seats on board. We lease capacity. Same thing like a satellite operator. We don't build the satellites, but we buy them. We don't build the rockets, but we buy them. And the space market is now at that stage for lunar services. It's incredible. But it's a great backup. Imagine it. You look up in the sky every night and you see the moon, and you know that your data is safe up there and you can physically see it like a satellite. You touched there on a few of the technological aspects of it, the satellites and the launch missions and things like that. Talk us a little bit through the technology that you'll be utilising. I think on your press release that you put out back in March regarding the recent funding round, you had an image that looked something like a refrigerator on stilts standing on the moon. So what does a lunar data centre look like? How big is it? What kind of infrastructure does it need to survive on the moon? Oh, Jonathan, shame on you. That is the beautiful Nova C lander from Intuitive Machines, granted with their permission. And that's an incredible lunar lander in itself. Yeah, so we attach as a hosted payload to the lunar lander. And these landers provide power and communications and thermal management. Our payload itself has thermal management. So in data centre terms, think of the lunar lander as the grey space, or think of the satellites that we're getting ready to procure to go in lunar orbit as the grey space of a data centre that handles power, thermal management, communications. And then the white space is our payload. Those are racks, for want of a better word. And so, you know, we're using SSDs, no moving parts, high capacity SSDs, space qualified. I see SSDs in space. Well, don't forget the Mars helicopter, as we speak, is flying around in a tremendous radiation environment on the surface of Mars using a Phison SSD, I think about a terabyte on that one. And we're running on a Snapdragon chip running Ubuntu Linux. And this is the most amazing thing. We start to take all of the advances in information technology, in data centres, in IT, in software and equipment, and we start applying that for use in space. Wow. It is an exponential leap forward. It's actually highly disruptive because normally in space, we're very conservative. And we're conservative too, don't get me wrong. But the idea being that, you know, oftentimes like the Mars rover that's at the moment is running on a 2003 MacBook chip, an old Intel chip, right? And so that's quite advanced. The advances in information technology haven't quite made it to space yet. And we are riding that wave of innovation. And it's tremendous for us because it means, for example, our flight in February, this is the first ever data centre off planet. We are operating a micro semi polar fire chip now made by microchip. It's an FPGA field programmable gate array. And we've got that running eight terabytes of storage from Pfizer. That's our payload with motherboards and everything else built for us by a company called Skycorp. We've done a tremendous job for us. That will be more than 10 times the capacity that NASA has ever flown in its history. What about the energy source for these data centres once they're on the moon, once they've landed safely and they're in position? I would assume it's solar energy. Yeah, it's that massive ball of fusion in the sky, which cracks me up. People go, fusion power is impossible. I'm like, have you looked at that big orange thing in the sky? That's fusion. And that's where we get our energy from. As does every single satellite and space station in space for the last 60 years, bar a couple of nuclear things from the Russians, right? I mean, so we're solar powered and solar power and battery. It is actually technically a tier four for the Uptime Institute. We have two sources of independent power. And as we go forward in the future and NASA and others are repeating what was done during the Apollo era and putting radio thermal electric generators, RTGs up there, which will work through the lunar night. The Chinese have an RTG running at the moment. They've been on active on the south lunar far side for 1,760 days continuously now. People forget that they landed in January, 2019. The little rovers and doing stuff and doing great science, but they're there. And that was Chang'e 4 mission. They've got Chang'e 5 actually brought things back from the moon. So it's a very active place because what we're realizing is, is the earth moon system, our entire economy on our planet reaches out into space. It's connected via satellite and it's now reaching out to the moon as a natural extension of the global economy because we can provide services to the global economy, leveraging the unique advances of our largest satellite, the moon. So you mentioned the energy part there, and, you know, I'm thinking again about the physical device that you've got situated on the moon at this point. Talk to us a little bit about the connectivity with earth. You know, some of our listeners might not be too familiar with, you know, the speed to transfer data from satellites to earth, and then from the earth to satellites to the moon. What's the, what's the kind of data connection like with the moon and how is that going to work with the data? I would assume that this is probably going to take a little bit longer than your edge data center around the corner. So you're not going to be storing your TikTok videos and your YouTube videos there. Oh, absolutely. No, we're not, we're not doing hot data. So no one's doing microsurgery or playing video games with all we have. This, this is premium storage, what we call bright data versus dark data. This is accessible storage 24 seven, and it is 400,000 kilometers away. So it's an 800,000 kilometer round trip. And so latency is actually our friend. We love latency because it helps us with encryption. It means we're not using TCP IP. And now look, so Jonathan, listeners, let's send a signal to the moon, have it processed and returned to us. Okay. You ready? Okay. Got the stopwatch going. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to hit send and here we go. Send one, two, three. Boom. We're done. We've sent a signal to the moon. It's been processed and it's come back in less time than it takes Netflix to turn on the movie for you. Yeah. It's 1.4 seconds each way. That's the propagation of a radio wave in a vacuum. That's the latency. It's very quick, right? And it's so a long way away, but very quick, but it means that we were more secure. And we're using radio spectrum for the first ones. These first missions with intuitive machines, and there's other providers going back to the moon. There's Firefly, there's Astrobotic, there's Draper Labs working with iSpace. There's a whole bunch of these people as part of NASA's commercial lunar payload services, CLPS program. It's a small program, 2.8 billion, billion here, a billion there, right? We're soon talking real money, but it's a fantastic program that NASA has to commercially take things to the moon. Same way SpaceX commercially takes people to space station. And by the way, SpaceX and Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos's company, won contracts to build lunar landers. And this week, SpaceX successfully tested the engines of their lunar lander, which is much bigger and involving Starship and incredible things as they go forward. So everything's changing. So radio spectrum to the moon. These first missions, these test missions that we're doing, we're part of, we're just one of many payloads on board these incredible missions that intuitive machines and others are flying for NASA. And they're using some S-bands. So it's a thin pipe backwards and forwards to the moon. Similar to what they had during Apollo, maybe slightly better. But as we go forward with our work, we have our own ITU filings, International Telecommunications Union, the most powerful organization that Dan Brown has yet to actually write a book about. They look after all global telecoms, an incredible organization of findings and standards and priority of nation states working there to make sure there's no interference and signals and a fantastic group of people at Geneva. We have a filing for K-band, X-band and S-band. So as we go forwards in our 2025 missions or 2026, when we do this, we're looking at about eight to 12 gigabits per second continuously each way, 24 hours a day. And as we start to build up capacity and we go into optical communications, we're then looking at terabytes per second each way. But we'll never match a cable fiber on the ground, but that's not what we're trying to do. We are just providing a unique network that has no connection to the public switching network or regular cable fiber. So to prevent against network intrusion, a complete unique network to the moon and back, like a little golden thread of data continuously going 24 hours a day. It's a thing of wonder. But look, we fly helicopters on Mars routinely. The moon is, I'm going to regret saying this, but the moon is actually not that hard when it comes to RF and comms. We've been running the deep space network for years and years and years. And that was part of my past when I was at Lockheed. So there are incredible people doing incredible things in both space and IT. And all we're doing at Lone Star is bringing them together and buying services from them. Yeah, well, it's certainly very interesting technology, Chris. And we look forward to hearing about your future success with this. Tell us a little bit more about where you are in the development of this technology and possibly the situation of some of these data center landers. I think you said you had two test flights coming up. What are the next steps for Lone Star going forward? Thank you. We got a test flight in November with Intuitive Machines. This is America's first return to the moon since Apollo. To the surface of the moon, that is. America's got a lot of orbiters flying around the moon at the moment, as have the Japanese and the Koreans and the Europeans and others who are doing incredible science and mapping and more. But this is the first time we've intentionally gone back to the surface. And so we're on that mission with Intuitive Machines. The state of Florida is our customer there. We're testing our concept of operations. We will be transmitting the first ever document in human history off planet for storage on the moon and pulling back a different document as well. So refresh, restore. We've got onboard storage on the lander itself. We then take it a step further in February where we've actually got the first physical. It's about a kilogram. I said the eight terabytes in the FPGA chip. And that's both missions sold out. And there we are doing a full data center test. Disaster recovery as a service, DRAS. We're doing a full test there. We're doing edge processing as well. I mean, we are at the ultimate edge, which is fantastic. And we're doing that. And then from there, we take those results and we go further. In late 25, 26, we are looking at a series of lunar orbiters, satellites around the moon full of petabyte level storage. And here's the unique thing, Jonathan, too. With a great partner like Intuitive Machines, a great provider like Intuitive Machines, we're able to test our data as we go to the moon, in orbit around the moon, and then when we're on the surface of the moon. So as we grow as a company and buy more services, we're able to test every facet with these test missions. And we've been blessed having Skycorp build the payload for us, fantastic set of people there, and then having Intuitive Machines as really quite an outstanding partner because we trust them to build the lunar lander. They're an incredible team of people drawn from all parts of the industry and from NASA itself working there at just outside the Johnson Space Center in Houston. They have their Nova C lander. They've got two of them ready to go, and they are tremendous. Great team of people to work with. So we've got people who have flown things in space their entire lives. Our team at LoneStar have flown things in space their entire lives and also built data centers their entire lives. And it's exciting. It's fun. We have to keep our head down and stay focused on the goal, otherwise we get too excited. And we have to try and make it as mundane as possible to make sure we've covered everything. Test, test, test, test again. Not just software loads and everything else, but more. Ubuntu, canonical, have been tremendous with us. We did the first ever software-defined data center up on Space Station back in late 2021. We did a generative art network, and we did that working with RedWire. We took over their 3D printer and partitioned the drive, and Ubuntu created a data center load for us of less than, with a kernel of 178 megs, and it worked flawlessly, flawlessly, Jonathan. So, you know, test our software, test our team, and we did machine learning, storage, like I said, a generative art network, and more. Been great fun. Some of the things that our listeners find fun are finance and money. So, you started this company about four years ago, Chris, put out the press release in March, which talked about a seed funding round for the company. How much do these data centers cost eventually, and how is the business financing these developments and every step of the way? And will you be looking for future financing? Oh, always. Jonathan, please name a business in the growth stage that doesn't need financing, so we were, again, very fortunate. Scout Ventures led our seed round for us, and we went to raise 5 million. We were oversubscribed and raised 5.225, and that was tremendous. Scout Ventures were joined by Zeldor, 2Future, Iron Gate, a typical Kitty Hawk, and then a series of individuals, remarkable individuals, who took a look at what we were doing. And by the way, VCs only invest in business cases that close. And so, they took a look at us, and as Chris Wake said, from Atypical, he said, look, this looks like it's outlandish, but he said in his words, the most stone cold, sober business case he'd ever seen. And Brad Harrison of Scout Ventures, within minutes of us talking to him and his team, he was like, I see it, I get it, this is incredible. Because we're taking an existing market with existing pain points and applying a new location that has never before been able to do using existing equipment, just to solve pain points of existing customers. And the customers love it. And that's why we're pushing these missions forward. So, we did that, we just finished a pre-series A, we won a Shark Tank at CEO.org, part of the YPO organization, and thanked them. I mean, it was remarkable. And we had a bunch of family funds approach us and said, please, we like what you're doing, we'd like to invest. So, we just finished our seed and we were oversubscribed. So, we did a pre-series A, that is since itself been oversubscribed. We went to raise 500 and we raised 825,000. And we're just heading into our series A, a 30 million series A, starting at the end of September. Already getting sincere interest there as well. And what about the cost of the data centers themselves? How big are these things? And what does it cost to put one together and then ship it to the moon? If you look at a classic data center on earth, and you were thinking, oh my gosh, I've got a building and I've got all this equipment and all this stuff. That's not what we're doing, right? So, for us, a data center is the storage, the compute, and then the infrastructure around that of power, thermal management, and communications. And so, we're looking at a classic satellite deployment, a classic lunar lander deployment. And what you'll find is that when we go big, when we get up to the exabyte level stage and more, we have different set of costs because we're looking at launch vehicles, we're looking at landers, we're looking at antennas, robotics, and equipment. No moving parts, by the way, and no people. This is lights out data centers, right? This is no people at all. This is 24-hour control from the mission control, which is manned 24 hours a day. But when you start getting to those larger stages of exabyte and even yottabyte up, our costs of building and deploying are roughly approximate to the cost of a terrestrial equivalent. However, actually slightly cheaper, ironically, but however, our operational costs, if we've got our numbers right, and the experts looking at this for us are down 93 to 97% lower because we have free power, free communications, and free cooling. It's a totally different way of doing it. That's a significant saving. It's a massive saving, isn't it? No, it really is. Dr. Mark Matosian is our chief operating officer, and he came out of Google where he'd done, he was a global architect for their data centers and built data centers around the world before. He also has a PhD in orbital mechanics, an amazing guy who also did a whole bunch of space companies too, so a unique combination. And so he's taken, before joining us, he took a long, hard look at this, as did our investors. And they looked at our numbers and our clients and customers and sales channels, partners in the data center industry. They all took a look at this and they went, oh my gosh, this works. I'm like, yeah, it works. And the moon is no longer out of reach. The moon is no longer something we did in the 1960s and 70s. You know, it's firmly within reach. I mean, we have the Indians there today. We have everyone else around the moon today. It's fantastic, right? 130 missions going in the next 10 years alone, not including our one. Look, we are living in the third decade of the 21st century and things have changed remarkably. And the thing is they've changed remarkably during COVID. An incredible amount of progress was made then on all sides of different, you know, as I said, team freedom and team tyranny, sadly, but everyone is going back. And this time it's not about flags and footprints or national pride. It's about resources, energy, and applications. And for us, it's an application. The moon just happens to be the best location for us to store data with a constant line of sight to the earth 24 hours a day. And we can meet data sovereignty for any client from any country and do so legally with case precedent. It's a wonderful solution. So it sounds like you've got a wide team of experts there, Chris, designing the technology and implementing the solutions. Who's handling the finance for you and what does that look like? Oh, excellent question, Jonathan. Thank you. As Buzz Aldrin said, no bucks, no Buck Rogers. And again, we're incredibly fortunate to have a consummate professional heading that up for us. That's Carol Goldstein. She was the person who founded the Satellite Finance Unit at Morgan Stanley. She ran global satellite finance at ING, ran global telecoms investing from cellular to cable to satellite at ABN AMRO. And so her entire career has been focused on space, satellite financing, taking companies from seed all the way through to IPO. And she's based up in New York and is a sort of a leading light on Wall Street for this kind of finance. And we are so lucky to have her. She keeps us firmly in line. But it also means that every conversation we have, we think like a banker, we think like an investor. And that coupled, as you kindly said, with the space tech and the data center tech that we have on board, it's a fantastic trifecta of a team. It's all very impressive, Chris. And thank you so much for sharing with me and with our listeners today, everything about Lone Star and your plans for these CIS Luna services that you're going to provide. It's very exciting. I found the conversation very interesting. And we look forward to hearing more about it as you carry out those first test flights and as the company grows and the application for these services increases. Chris, thanks again for joining us. Thanks for your very clear and very passionate explanations of the technology. Jonathan, thank you for having me. Thank you everybody for listening today. I hope you find this podcast interesting. We look forward to welcoming you to the next episode of Crossroads here at InfoLogic. For now, this is Jonathan Carmody, Americas Editor, signing off.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest on today's program is Corey Lewis, a managing director at Aon, a professional services firm that places tax insurance for participants in the renewable energy industry. Today we're going to talk about the tax insurance industry and its role in the renewable energy sector, and then we're going to discuss how transferability or the ability for investors to transfer tax credits that was created by the Inflation Reduction Act is going to change the renewable sector and where tax insurance fits into the picture. Corey, thank you for joining the pod. Thanks Andrew. It's great to be here. So now before we jump into these topics, I'm sure a lot of those listeners that are active in the renewable sector know all about Aon and the services it provides. But for the rest of our audience, can you give a brief explanation of Aon and what your firm does? Sure. Thanks, Andrew. So as mentioned, Aon is a global professional services firm. I work as part of the broader transaction solutions team. We place tax insurance, rep and warranty insurance, and litigation insurance on behalf of our clients, private equity firms, corporates, participants in the renewable energy industry. Myself, I've been with Aon for over eight years. Former practicing tax attorney before Aon, I was at PWC in the International Tax Department, focusing mostly on outbound real estate investing. I'm the co-head of the North American Tax Insurance Practice, and I really lead our tax credit insurance efforts. And how did you get into the tax insurance business? Yeah, thanks, Andrew. Great question. So I was always been looking for the type of position where I could work in both a legal and sort of business position or background. Tax insurance has been a great fit where I get to structure insurance programs in terms of how the capacity comes into play to get the best possible terms, conditions, and pricing for our clients, as well as negotiate the policies themselves. So it's something that I kind of fell into since I joined back in June 2015. I haven't looked back, so I've had a great experience in the tax insurance space. Well, thank you for that, Corey. And again, so for those of our listeners who aren't as familiar, can you explain a little bit what the tax insurance industry does and what role it has in the historic US renewable energy sector? Sure, definitely. So some listeners may be more familiar with our sister product, Rep and Warranty Insurance. There, we see Rep and Warranty Insurance being used in M&A transactions. And with Rep and Warranty Insurance, you're insuring unknown risks, that there was a breach of a rep at signing or at closing. With tax insurance, you're insuring known identifiable tax issues or tax risks. And we really see tax insurance used in three key areas. First, in an M&A context, buyer and seller can't agree on whether there is a tax issue or they agree that there's a tax issue, but they can't agree on the amount. Rather than having to escrow, let's say $100 million for seven years, you can instead obtain $100 million tax insurance policy for, let's say, two and a half to three and a half cents on the dollar, allow for the transaction to go through, allow for a cleaner exit from the seller's perspective. The second area where we see tax insurance used, corporate balance sheet risk mitigation. So tax positions taken on tax returns, no M&A activity, no transaction needed. Clients and their advisors think that they are probably right. But if they're wrong, they could be wrong in a big way. So shifting that risk off their balance sheet into the tax insurance markets, and just as a brief aside, we can insure under audit tax issues depending upon the facts and circumstances. And then the third and final area, the one most relevant to our conversation today is the tax credit space. While that can and does include all different types of tax credits, whether we're talking about R&D credits or historic tax credits, the vast majority of my time and effort is spent in the renewable energy tax credit space, ITC's investment tax credits, PTC's production tax credits, solar, wind, standalone battery storage, dynamic glass, anaerobic digester, geothermal, all different types of technologies. We've seen tax insurance used in the renewable space as long ago as the early 1990s, but it's really taken off probably around 2013, 2014. We're being brought to the table by sponsors, developers, as well as tax equity investors, funders, and now Post-Inflation Reduction Act, and I know we'll get into this in a little bit, tax credit sellers, and tax credit buyers. So different parties, part of the capital stack to renewable energy financing transaction, bringing tax insurance to the table to provide a solution to help deals get done, to help provide certainty in areas where there is some uncertainty. So if I understand correctly, your role would be when there is some uncertainty when it comes to whatever tax credit, you would step in and provide insurance? I mean, can you give an example of a role that you would play there? Yeah, sure. So the most common policy that we place ensures that the amount of the qualified basis or fair market value of a project will be respected by the tax authority. So as I'm sure you're aware, with the investment tax credit or ITC, the amount of the tax credit is a percentage of the fair market value. That fair market value is typically determined by a third party appraiser, and within that fair market value, you have a combination of hard costs, the amount that you're actually paying for equipment from third parties, and soft costs, the developer profit, the developer margin. Going back to the Section 1603 cash grant days, there's been some uncertainty around what is an appropriate developer margin or appropriate developer profit. So with that in mind, there are definitely entrants in the renewable energy space who are conservative and are unsure, uncertain around whether that developer margin or developer profit will be respected by the tax authority. So they may be hesitant about contributing capital to the project with that uncertainty in the transaction. With tax insurance, we can ensure this particular risk, and we can make the tax equity investor or the tax credit buyer whole for any losses of any taxes, potential interest, possible penalties, contest costs, or legal fees, and to gross up. So if the insurance proceeds themselves are deemed to be taxable, the insurance policy can pay any taxes on the proceeds themselves. In the event that the tax authority successfully challenges what the fair market value is honing in most likely on those soft costs, that developer profit, developer margin. So that's where we see the certainty being provided from a tax insurance perspective, and it's really being used to either help deals get done or improve pricing in deals. A lot of different reasons for folks to look to tax insurance from a financing perspective. So tax insurance really does play a big role in the renewable energy industry. Now, it's been about a year, I guess, a little bit more since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. And for across the renewable energy sector, that's been really a game changer. How has that affected what you do and the tax insurance market? At sort of a very high level, it's increased the amount of tax credit insurance opportunities that we're seeing, the amount of limits that we're placing deals that had been previously agreed upon by the various parties are now coming back to the table, finding out that they're now qualifying for some of the ITC adders that I know we'll get to in a bit. So seeing that the amount of credits that we're seeking to ensure increasing and just the amount of deals as well as some new technologies and some new and novel structures that are being contemplated. So some increased complexity, but also definitely a lot of more of the same of the type of risk or risk that we've been ensuring from even before the Inflation Reduction Act passing a year ago. One big change that the Inflation Reduction Act created was the creation of transferability or the ability of an investor to transfer tax credits rather than directly monetizing them. And that's that's been a focus of our coverage at InfraLogic recently, and also the our previous podcast, if you want to go back and listen to my podcast from July. Now there are a few reasons that investors and sponsors have tended to prefer tax equity rather than the transferability of tax credits. Now one of them is that with transferability, it is a little bit more difficult to monetize depreciation. And another is something you touched on before. It's more difficult to receive the fair market value of a project rather than simply the cost of constructing that project. And those are kind of two challenges in the transferability market really becoming the preference or the default go to in the renewable industry. Now how does tax insurance fit into this? Are you on the ground in terms of creating some of the structures that might make transferability more usable and more commonplace? Yeah, thanks, Andrew. That's another great question. So we're not necessarily creating the structures, but we are reacting to the structures or brainstorming with our clients around potential structures and whether tax insurance will be able to be an appropriate fit to help provide certainty in those areas where there are some uncertainty. So in its simplest construct with transferability, a third party seller, the sponsor developer of the project could then sell the credits to a third party buyer with a simple purchase and sale agreement. As you hinted at, some of the issues there become not being able to potentially monetize the depreciation. And then the question becomes whether you're able to take a step up so that you can take the credit off of the fair market value, not just necessarily the hard costs. What we are seeing are folks looking to actually form tax equity partnerships either to monetize the depreciation and or to take advantage of the step up to get that fair market value. That includes not just the cost, but what you're typically used to seeing from a third party appraiser and then having that partnership sell all or a portion of the credits to a third party transferee. So that's one of the creative ways that we're seeing the industry react to transferability. Now I know there was some thoughts by folks in the industry around with transferability, whether diligence would still need to be done in much the same way that we typically see it done from a tax equity investment perspective. The answer to that is yes, there definitely still needs to be diligence done around the risk or risks that we're asking the insurers to ensure, as well as the risk or risks that the buyer of the credit is going to be looking to the sell of the credit to potentially provide an indemnity for. So with these new structures, we're seeing the tax insurance market react very positively to them, providing terms and conditions as they have been previously, even before the Inflation Reduction Act at kind of the best in class pricing that we're typically used to seeing. So with that said, we're having a good reaction from the tax insurance markets with some of the new things that we are seeing post Inflation Reduction Act, post transferability. We're seeing tax insurance used in kind of two key ways. One is what we call a double trigger policy, and the other policy is what we call a single trigger policy. With a double trigger policy, the insurance basically needs to have two things need to happen before there's a payout. One, there needs to be a loss under the policy, two, the seller of the credit needs to fail to live up to its indemnity or guarantee obligations to the buyer of the credit. Then the insurance policy pays out, but the insurer has the ability to subrogate against the seller of the credit. From the seller of the credit's perspective, the benefit to a double trigger policy is but for the insurance, maybe the deal doesn't get done. The alternative is a single trigger policy, and with a single trigger policy, all that needs to happen is for there to be a loss under the policy, and then the insurer pays out. The idea there being that tax insurance in theory could be used in lieu of an indemnity or guarantee. As I'm sure listeners of this podcast know, tax equity investors, tax credit buyers like to have their cake and eat it too, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that there'll be tax insurance in place alongside an indemnity or guarantee. Tax insurance could mitigate or push down the chance that the indemnity or guarantee gets called upon, so there's a benefit there from the sponsor, developer, seller of the credit's perspective. The other alternative is that the buyer of the credit doesn't even necessarily need to know about the tax insurance. The seller of the credit could have the tax insurance in place behind the scenes, running back to back with any indemnity or guarantee that they're providing. With that, if their indemnity or guarantee gets called upon, they can look to the tax insurance policy to pay on their behalf. So is it too soon to say which structures, which types of tax insurance are becoming the preference of the industry in these kinds of deals? I think it's a little too soon to tell. I think it's a little bit like the wild, wild west right now. I think the industry itself is trying to figure out sort of what the norm is. We are definitely seeing an uptick in folks wanting to ensure the structural tax risks around these unique transfer structures, where there is a tax equity partnership that then transfers the credit. The idea being that the structural tax risks are risks that cannot be covered by the typical tax indemnity or guarantee that the sponsor developer or seller of the credit is providing. Typically we're seeing tax opinions obtained at a level of comfort or stronger, but folks are still wanting that additional certainty where someone will make them whole in the event of a loss. And that's where tax insurance is going to play a large role. So we're definitely seeing an uptick in that, but there are still a wide variety of requests or interests in terms of what type of risk or risks folks are looking to ensure. It really varies on a case by case or deal by deal basis, very much a risk appetite or risk profile perspective, as well as a commercial negotiation between the parties involved. So you mentioned earlier that historically tax insurance has played a role in ensuring that the fair market value of a project and the tax credits that are received as a basis of that are what the parties in the deal are expecting. And obviously that's become even more complicated now with transferability. How has the role of tax insurance changed there in ensuring that the fair market value is received? Yeah. I mean, I definitely think we have seen an uptick in requests for ensuring that particular risk. And it's definitely been very clear in the discussions to date in the years since the IRA was passed that that risk is not going away from the top of mind of most participants in this marketplace. For policies that we have previously placed, we are seeing some audits in this space. So that is something that is out there. We are seeing the tax authority move quite slow, but we're seeing the tax insurance policy really react very positively from a claims perspective where the insurer and the insured are really working together with the insurers being very deferential to our clients and our clients' advisors who they treat as the true experts in this space. So continuing to see the appraisals react to court cases and other items and just the economy in general, but really seeing the tax insurance markets react very positively to industry changes as we speak in different structures that we see being contemplated in real time. One of the questions that we've been exploring at InfraLogic and on this podcast is whether the tax transferability market is going to kind of emerge as the default for the industry or whether it's still going to be that investors and sponsors that are able to get traditional tax equity are going to prefer to do that and transferability is really going to be a backup or going to be when there's not enough traditional tax equity. That's kind of been a debate within the industry. As somebody who's been involved and with your ear to the ground, what's your sense of how that's going to shake out? Yeah, I mean, I think it's been very clear in these early days that tax equity investing is not going away. If anything, I think with some of the structures we've discussed, the transferability provides even sort of an additional option that makes economic sense where they can offload a portion or some of the credits that they would otherwise take on their balance sheet. So it's been very clear that for a lot of the large tax equity investor participants in this marketplace that they're going to continue to be providing capital contributions in return for tax credits via the tax equity investment market. Now with that said, I think we will continue to see a huge growth in the transferability space for some of the smaller projects that maybe wouldn't economically pencil out from a tax equity investor investment perspective. I think that you're going to see transferability really rule of day for a lot of those smaller type projects. But I think if anything, transferability just provides additional flexibility, it provides additional options. So I think it's really going to be to the renewable energy industry's advantage that they're going to be able to take a number of different options or items into account when determining what makes the most economic sense from the developer's perspective. But I definitely do not think that the tax equity investors, as we know them pre-inflation reduction act are going anywhere. And I think that will still be a very strong and robust market. Well thank you for that, Corey. And just a note to listeners, if you're interested in reading more on this topic and you're an Infralogix subscriber, me and my colleagues, Kyle Yonker and Chuck Stanley, did a two-piece series on transferability that you could find in our website under the analysis tab. And also, if you want to listen back to my last episode, I had Brian Alperin, a partner and managing director with Fossum Co. on to discuss a lot of these same themes. So if you have to listen to this podcast, you're looking for more on the topic, I recommend you check out those two sources. Now another question, Corey, when it comes to the Inflation Reduction Act, it created a lot of what have been called adders, where you get a bonus on top of the ITC or PTC if you either build your projects in certain, what are called energy communities or low-income communities or if you use domestic content, especially when it comes to domestic content, there's a lot of questions about what's going to qualify and a lot of projects that are building based on the expectation that they're going to receive these adders, I'm guessing that creates a new type of risk if it doesn't come through for whatever reason. Is tax insurance playing a role there in terms of protecting investors when there's uncertainty in terms of the adders? Definitely. That's been a key topic of discussion with all participants in the renewable energy industry around whether tax insurance will be available for any or all of the adders. You really hit the nail on the head in terms of the specific adders that we're seeing. We have already insured the energy community adder, we've replaced insurance in that policy before guidance had come out. Very confident that we'll be able to insure all of the adders, whether it's energy community or domestic content or low-income community and even the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirement itself. The key thing is going to be from the insurer's perspective, looking at the due diligence or understanding how are the participants in the transaction getting comfortable that the project or projects are in fact qualifying for the adder. It's becoming common as well in certain instances where folks are very comfortable with all of the other tax risks, some of which we've already talked about today, but it's just the specific adder that they want to insure. And so we're able to customize tax insurance to insure just that very narrow risk, size the limit of liability to reflect the specific difference in credit that would be lost if the adder wasn't respected and to insure that particular risk for a transaction, which can make a real economic difference in terms of what the capital contribution will be from a tax equity investing perspective or what the price per credit will be when you're talking about how many credits is the buyer going to actually purchase. There's definitely been an increase in terms of calls recently, especially as guidance has come out for each and any of the adders, but it is something where we've been very pleased to see the tax insurance market reacting positively. These are some of the new risks that the tax insurance markets are looking to insure as opposed to a lot of the old risks, which we've been insuring even before the Inflation Reduction Act. And so far, the tax insurance market has been reacting extremely positively to these risks and been able to wrap these risks at very attractive pricing. Well, thank you for that, Corey. And I'm afraid this is all the time we have today. Corey, this has been a really interesting look at the tax insurance market and the role that it plays across renewable energy. Finally, if people want to learn more about Aon, where can they find more information about you guys? Yeah, you can definitely just Google Aon and find things online about the Aon Transaction Services Team or Aon Tax Insurance. I'm happy to be reached at Corey.Lewis, C-O-R-E-Y.L-E-W-I-S at Aon.com for any and all questions related to tax credit insurance. And Aon, that's spelled A-O-N. Correct. Thanks, Andrew.

This is your host, Andrew Vitelli. Thank you for tuning in today. Our guest is Brian Alperin, who is a Partner and Managing Director with Foss&Co, a firm specializing in the tax credit industry, and he's a timely guest as investors are now beginning to try to make sense of the new rules around the Inflation Reduction Act. I spoke to Brian earlier this month, and he is quoted in Infralogic's two-part analysis piece on the tax credit transfer market. That story can be found on our website. Brian, thank you for joining the program today. Thank you, Andrew. Excited to be here. So we have a lot to get to today, but before we get started, can you tell our audience a little bit about Foss&Co? Sure, I'd be happy to. Foss&Co specializes in tax credits. We've been focused in this space for 40 years now. We're just celebrating our 40-year anniversary. And so really, we help large institutional investors like large banks, large insurance companies and other major corporations efficiently access the tax credit market. We've covered all types of different tax credits over our history. Today, we're primarily focused on renewable energy tax credits, historic tax credits, and various state credits around the country. But I think for this conversation, we'll be focused on the renewables. Well, thank you for that, Brian. And can you tell me a little bit about your background in this industry? Absolutely. So I started my career in banking, commercial lending primarily. And I actually initially joined Foss&Co on the real estate side. So I was working with them on historic tax credits. I was recruited to essentially underwrite those transactions on behalf of some of our large funds that we do for some of the big banks on the historic tax credit side. But in my past in banking, I did have some renewable energy experience with USDA REAP loans and others. And so as the firm was launching a renewable energy group out here in Denver, after about a year with the firm, I made the move over, left the Bay Area and came out to Denver. It was essentially the number two hire for renewables group out here. My former boss ended up departing. And so I doubled down and stuck it out with renewables and have built a team here in Denver since then. Well, that's good to hear. And it's definitely an exciting time in the renewables space, and especially when it comes to tax equity and tax credits. Yes, absolutely. We've been having a ton of growth on the renewables side. We already were growing at a pretty tremendous pace before the IRA. And the IRA has really just accelerated that growth rate. So at this point, although we launched the renewables group relatively recently in the last four or five years, we're over 60% of the firm's overall volume. And that's not because the other segments are shrinking. We've just been growing at a tremendous pace on the renewables side. And I think that will continue. So you mentioned the IRA, and it's been almost a year since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which really kind of upended and really revolutionized the way that renewables projects are going to be funded and financed, including the tax credit market. Now, how dramatic has that change been in the last year? And really, where is the industry in terms of this new world? Yeah, so when it first got passed, we had some immediate impact from even projects that we'd already closed that were expected to be 26% ITCs or investment tax credits, suddenly saw the tax credit amounts increased to 30%. And so we had a busy time reopening a bunch of closed transactions and working through that. And we actually, for some of those, well, all those that had already closed, we weren't necessarily contractually obligated to pay for those additional credits. We did anyway. And I think many investors in the space did just to be good partners for those transactions. And then we saw the pipeline of projects that we were either in closing on or had identified as potential opportunities for the following year grew substantially, not just because of the increase to the 30% credit, but also many of them qualified for adders up and above the 30%. And some of these portfolios of smaller projects saw additional windfalls, like being able to include interconnect property in their eligible basis. So overall, the amount of tax credits on some of these portfolios, in some cases doubled. And so we saw a huge influx of credits available in the market. We've worked through that for 2023. I think for 2024, we're seeing a similar situation where there's just a lot of credits out there. And so we're having to not only deploy funds with our existing investors, but work hard at bringing new investors into the space just to keep up with demand from our existing partners in the development community. We've seen the transferability provision hopefully will help alleviate some of that and even out the supply and demand, allow new investors to come into the space more easily. And we're seeing some of that activity pick up now that guidance is out. So we have previously spoken at length about transferability, but just in case some of our listeners might not be as familiar with tax equity versus the transferability market. Can you give a brief explanation of what the difference is between the transferability, between tax transferability and traditional tax equity? Yeah. So when we say traditional tax equity, we're referring to the structures that have been traditionally used to allocate tax credits to an investor. So in these transactions, typically that involved the investor actually having a partnership interest and actual ownership interest in the underlying projects that then allowed them to be allocated the tax credits. And we don't have to get into the details, but these are pretty complex structures that were set up to efficiently pass tax credits to these investors in the most tax-optimized manner. So you had to have a actual partnership interest, and it led to more complicated equity method accounting for those investors that were investing in these. It also, the IRS required you to have a certain amount of risk in the transaction to be considered a true equity partner. So when we were structuring these transactions, it was always a balance of mitigating risks in some areas, but making sure that we were taking enough risk that we would be treated as an equity partner and therefore able to claim the credits. This new transferability provision really was a new paradigm in how you could actually get the tax credits to the investors. So instead of having to be an equity partner, essentially in a project, you could now sell these credits the way that a certificated state credit might be sold. So you can take advantage of these transfer provisions to just sell the credits to a separate taxpayer, and they can pay, there's some rules around that, they have to pay in cash, and there's some other restrictions in the guidance, but they don't need to have ownership in the project. So it really simplifies the transaction, at least the accounting and sort of the legal structure of it. So you mentioned before that a lot of your clients are seeing a need for greater, more tax credit providers for more partners. Are these going to come mostly from more players in the traditional tax equity space, or is this going to come from people entering the space through transferability? You know, I think it's going to be some of both. Certainly traditional players that are already active in the market may increase their activity. There's more attention on renewable energy tax credits these days, and they may be able to get slightly higher yields because of the state of the market. So that might drive them to deploy more capital, get approval internally for a larger allocation to be deployed. So some of these existing players may increase the amount they're deploying. That said though, we're also seeing some existing players that have taken a step back, regional banks for example, that had issues with deposits and things like that, that may not be as active as they were before. Overall though, I think that the existing players will probably be increasing their activity somewhat, but I think a lot of the growth will have to come from new investors entering the market, and some of those will go the transferability route. We're also seeing some still choose to go the traditional tax equity route. So that's just a conversation we're having with new investors and as we're working through the education process to help them decide what the right path is for them. So I think traditionally the tax equity market has been in the range of $18 to $20 billion a year. There have been some major players like JP Morgan, Bank of America, and a handful of others. Projections I've read have said that in the coming years, there's going to need to be about $50 billion per year of some type of tax credits as the industry ramps up and takes advantage of all of the clauses of the Inflation Reduction Act. Is there any way that the traditional tax equity market can scale up that dramatically or is it mostly going to be transferability filling that gap? I think it'll be some of both. I do think there's room for the tax equity market to scale up. We have investors that we work with who have billions of dollars of tax liability per year and they may only be deploying $100 million, $200 million a year. So there's certainly room for them to increase the amount they're allocating. And for them, it's going to be dependent on how many projects they can find that are kind of the right risk profile and right return profile that are attractive for them. So if returns improve slightly and perhaps we have less competition among investors for some of the lowest risk projects, that will help some of these large institutional groups deploy more capital that they're comfortable with. Yields increase slightly potentially, that might bring some additional smaller tax equity players into the market as well. For the transferability, that's a new space. I think that will help fill the gap. It's still playing out in terms of exactly which segments that will fill. But for example, with the PTCs on wind projects or now solar projects can choose to generate PTCs and in some cases that may be favorable. Those credits, because they're not subject to recapture, seem really well suited for the transferability. So we're seeing a lot of investor interest in those. I think that's an area where we'll likely, at least for our activities, lean more towards the transferability. And you mentioned that when you're speaking with clients, you're having these discussions about, does it make sense to go the traditional tax equity route? Does it make sense to look at the transfer market? What are those conversations looking like? What are the pros and cons of transferability as compared to traditional tax equity? We are sort of a full service provider to these groups in that there's some initial education work, but once a fund is set up, really we're doing the heavy lifting and they're receiving a K-1 at the end of the year with their tax credits. There's some conversations along the way, but we're trying to do most of the heavy lifting on their behalf. So for them, the transferability, I think the primary benefit there is it does simplify the closing process a bit, but it also simplifies the accounting. So the gap accounting for these transactions can be fairly complicated in the traditional tax equity approach. And sometimes the results that they're getting from an accounting perspective can cause issues, such as volatility in their income statements, et cetera. So the transferability simplifies the accounting quite a bit. I think that's kind of the primary benefit. And then for groups that are coming in and are brand new to this, when they're trying to educate and get buy-in internally, I think there's a perception that the transferable credits may be an easier ask internally because they're just more similar to, for example, the certificate of state credits that some of these groups are already doing. There's a little bit less to wrap your head around with the complex structuring that goes into the tax equity. But I think when we kind of dive deep into those conversations, sometimes investors are disappointed to realize that even with the transferable credits, like on an ITC, you're still subject to recapture risk as the buyer. There's still a need for due diligence. So it's not as simple as just buying a certificate of state credit. You still have some risk and there's still a need for diligence. And so sometimes when they look at the diligence that's going to be necessary and the risk level and say, well, I might as well just do tax equity and just get a much higher return than I would get on the transferable credits. So you've mentioned recapture. And for some of our listeners who haven't read my article yet and haven't been following this discussion closely, that's something that has been a big topic since the IRS released its guidance last month. Can you explain what recapture is and when it takes effect? Yeah, sure. So there's various different types of tax credits within the Inflation Reduction Act and each of them might have slightly different recapture profiles. But I'll talk about the ITC, the Investment Tax Credit, which is kind of the most popular tax credit that has recapture associated with it. And this is the tax credit used in the solar space and used in some other renewable energy markets. So there's really three categories in my mind of recapture for the ITC or things that could cause recapture. And I guess just what is recapture, maybe to start. So recapture, you know, when the investor is allocated tax credits, what I'm referring to when I say recapture is something that would cause them to lose those tax credits that they had essentially paid for or they had invested in a project and been allocated credits, something that causes them to retroactively lose those credits. The ITC has a five-year compliance period, both for the transferable credit and the traditional tax equity, where during that five years, there's certain things that could cause you to lose some or all of your tax credits. So those obviously are tremendous risks if any of them were to occur. And so we spend a lot of time making sure that those risks are well mitigated. One thing that could cause recapture would be a change of ownership of the project that generated the tax credits. So the typical situation here would be if the project had project-level debt from a lender and that lender foreclosed on the project, therefore forcing a change of ownership. That could cause recapture of the tax credits. The IRS wants the ownership to stay the same for the five years. What we do in a traditional tax equity transaction is either just not have project debt, which is the most common situation. But in cases where there is project-level debt, there will be an inter-party agreement or forbearance agreement that's negotiated with the lender, whereby they agree during those five years not to take actions that would cause a recapture tax credit. So essentially they're saying, even if our loan was in default, we won't foreclose on the loan during those five years. That's the first one. In the transferability market, if we were structuring those transactions, we could still mitigate that risk. But I think for folks that are new coming into the space, less familiar, they may not think about, well, I just bought this tax credit. What happens if the sponsor adds debt to the project next year and then that debt gets foreclosed on in two years? They may not realize that they're subject to potentially losing some of their tax credits. So it's something that has to be thought about and structured around on these transactions. There's ways of doing that, but the point is, you got to work with a group that can diligence and structure in those protections. But it makes these deals a little bit more complicated than maybe the industry was hoping when the IRA was first signed into law. Yeah. There was a hope that perhaps the recapture risk for the transferable credits would remain with the seller. Therefore, the buyer could essentially buy these credits risk-free and not have to think too much about them. That's not the case. It seems to me that the IRS wants the buyers to do some diligence. And I think that's probably sort of a fraud mitigation tool where the IRS is having the buyers do some of their work for them and making sure that these projects are sound and that the amount of tax credits being claimed is real. Yeah. That's one of the three. The second thing that could cause recapture is a project no longer qualifying as energy property. So for example, if a storm came and destroyed the solar power plant and there was no plans to rebuild it and it was just abandoned, that could cause recapture. So we need to make sure there's appropriate insurance in place, et cetera, to rebuild. As long as you're rebuilding, there likely is not a recapture. And then the third, which isn't exactly recapture, but it kind of gets lumped into this conversation about recapture, is a partial disallowance of tax credits. So if the IRS came in in an audit after maybe a year or two down the road, they could look at this transaction and for some reason decide that you didn't qualify for as many tax credits as you claimed. So for example, they might disagree with your calculation of the eligible basis or they might disagree with you qualifying for a certain adder, et cetera. So the way to mitigate that is we have various third parties doing diligence to confirm that the project qualifies for all the credits it's claiming, get a legal opinion, and we'll often put tax credit insurance on top of all that as kind of an additional mitigant. All right. Well, thank you for that summary. So getting back to which deals look for tax transference versus traditional tax equity, I mean, can you give an example of a deal where you'd say, hey, this deal really can take advantage of the transfer market versus one where tax equity is much preferred? Yeah. I noted that the PTC's production tax credit seemed to lend themselves well to this transferability market. So if a wind project is claiming PTCs, it may be a good candidate. Or if now the solar can claim PTCs, so these solar projects that may claim PTCs could be good candidates for the transferable credits. In some cases, the ITC makes sense for transferability as well. It's a little bit more case by case, though. I think where we're seeing it apply most often is situations where for whatever reason it's difficult to get tax equity in the ITC market, then this transferability option can become a good backup option. We actually are working on a sort of interesting transaction right now where we are providing a sort of standby commitment to buy ITCs at a certain price. And the developer has an option to essentially terminate that purchase. So they're going to go out and look for tax equity and hopefully find tax equity at better terms. But they know they have this purchase as a backup option, and that gives their construction lenders comfort that there's some kind of buyer out there for these credits. So another big factor, it seems, is going to be who's able to get tax equity. Because even in cases where the preference might be for tax equity, where there might be advantages, some we've talked about and others that we haven't, there's a limited availability of tax equity. So tapping the transferability market might also become a backup for a lot of these players? Yeah. So some of the large investors in the market have fairly high minimum thresholds for their transaction size, $100 million or $50 million. And so if you are especially working on smaller transactions, it may be more difficult to find a tax equity investor, or if there's something about the project or the sponsor that maybe gives tax equity investors some concern. So for example, we saw a project in the Ercon market in Texas that had some issues with it, I guess I would say, that made traditional tax equity uncomfortable with that project. So they determined, though, that if they were to transfer the credits, the buyer wouldn't be as exposed to those risks. And so that was their plan was to seek transferable credits. So Brian, we're running out of time, but I like to end my conversations in a forward looking way. So we've had a really interesting year in the tax equity tax credit market, I'm sure. You look at where we were a year ago before the IRA had been signed, it was a very different world for you, for your industry. But looking forward, what is the main thing you're looking out for in the year to come? We're expecting, you know, continued growth in the solar and storage space that we've been very focused on. And we're also excited to see some of these newer technologies that are being supported by the IRA start to pick up steam. So we've been working a lot on things like carbon capture, green hydrogen, I think there's emerging players in the commercial electric vehicle and electric vehicle infrastructure space. There's a lot of exciting things, manufacturing, there's a long list of new credits that came out of the IRA. And so I think in 2024, we're going to see more of those starting to hit the market. And so that will create an interesting environment for, you know, tax investors that they'll have more options for types of projects and maybe some better opportunities. And then for developers, you know, I think there's still challenges with cost of debt, supply chain, etc. But hopefully, as we see, you know, them more able to take advantage of these adders that are coming to effect, you know, we'll hopefully get some good guidance on the low income adder, for example. And that'll help support a lot more projects being built. And, you know, we'll have the biggest year ever for renewables. So I'm pretty optimistic right now. I think, you know, there's there's some risk that, you know, for example, we had a big recession, maybe that eats up some of the tax appetite for these these investors and kind of further hurts the tax equity markets. But you know, right now, at least we're seeing a lot of investors still eager to pick up credits. We'll have to have you back on next year to discuss how some of these other trends develop. Yeah, absolutely. We'd love to. Brian, thank you so much for joining the program today. It's been a really interesting conversation. I think it'll be really useful for listeners.

My name is Robin Ganguly, and I'm the Global Executive Editor for InfraLogic, which is a combination of information and SparkSpread. Now, today's focus is on renewables, among the most popular sectors with both readers and users of InfraLogic's database. Now, to put things in perspective, more than $187 billion of deals closed in the five years through June this year. That's in the Asia-Pacific renewable sector. Now, globally, the figure was $1.1 trillion. Now, we will present some forward-looking data later on in this program as well. Now, one of the leaders of that massive push is BlackRock, whose assets pushed past $9 trillion in the first quarter of this year. Now, I have with me today Dr. Valerie Speth, Co-Lead APAC for the Climate Infrastructure Group, which invests and manages investments and portfolio companies of the $4.8 billion Global Renewable Power Fund III, as well as the $673 million Climate Finance Partnership. Now, she brings more than 15 years of experience in the renewable power sector, both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Now, Valerie, welcome to the program. I also have with me Celine Ge, who is the Greater China Editor at InfraLogic. Valerie, welcome once again. And to begin the program, if you could say a few words to introduce yourself to our global audience. Yeah, very happy to be here today. So as mentioned before, I'm one of these renewable energy pioneers starting in Europe 15 years ago when the industry was still very small, you know, and just a couple of people working there. And then I worked many years in a startup and grew from 300 to 3,000 people. I worked for big utilities in Europe and then also as the CEO for a renewable energy company here in Asia for five years before I joined two years ago BlackRock and did a move from the operational business into the financing sector. Now, that's quite the resume. I've been following you on LinkedIn for a while, and I know you wear many different hats. You also have 40 under 40 in Germany, am I right? Yes, correct. Correct. Three years in a row. So it's a great community, you know, also a lot of impact leaders. And I've seen even that crowd, you know, change over time, more and more people focusing on green energy and the transition to net zero. You know, Valerie, you know, you being based in Singapore, that gives you quite a very interesting perspective on the whole of the Asia Pacific market. Now, to start off the program, I'm going to ask you the first question of the day. One is particularly key for our listeners and viewers. Now, which sectors in power and energy do you think present the biggest opportunities? Now, this I'm talking about emerging Asian markets. I think at the moment, you know, we have the biggest investment opportunity ahead of us. I think the numbers are really big. The latest number was 4.7 trillion until 2040, which is a very big number, right? And it's difficult to understand what that really means. But I think that overall, the energy power sector has two really great pillars. The first one, it really adds diversification and it can mitigate risk, you know, when you add it into a portfolio. And even lately, the market has been stressed. We see that it shows kind of commonality with fixed income. And that means it allows for our investors to give them some downside risk protection. And then the second point is infrastructure really has an impact. So it has a positive impact by producing green energy. We also want to be mindful, you know, of inherently local in nature, and it allows jobs to be in rural areas as well. So I think overall, here in the region, we have seen a lot of opportunities along the entire value chain, and we see really good deal flow. So in the last two years, we have been investing more than $2.5 billion in climate infrastructure here in Asia. And that is in a platform in Korea, when we invested in wind and solar, in Japan, in solar power, in Taiwan, in solar, and also added to the portfolio, you are now EV charging and battery. In Australia, we have also EV charging and battery company and New Zealand solar. And these countries, you know, they're driven still at the moment by pretty strong government frameworks. Then when you venture a bit into the non-OECD countries, lately you have seen, you know, institutions that raised impact funds, more and more impact funds. And then on the other hand, you also saw that manufacturing has moved from other locations into Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines. So in giving the current volatility, these companies and the manufacturing, they require independent sources for electricity because they have been exposed to a lot of volatility lately on the electricity prices. That means in non-OECD countries, even though you might not have a very strong underlining government regulation, now it's pretty much market driven. And we are supporting that through one of our vehicles, it's called the Climate Finance Partnership and is a public-private planned finance instrument where we have already done our first investment, which was in the Philippines. And there will be a couple more deals coming this year. So very excited, you know, to do more in the non-OECD region. That's very exciting because, you know, we've seen, especially in Southeast Asia, a lot of potential in India, massive potential, especially in renewables, China, you know, people have been watching very, very carefully, but we haven't seen an explosion of investments as well. And interesting, you should bring up TPPs, you know, we're having the US P3 conference on the 13th and 14th of June, I'll be heading there, you know, we hope to have a lot of very interesting discussions. Now, Valerie, just putting your, just looking at what you said about massive opportunity investments. So, Celine and I were looking at, you know, data on our Entrologic platform that we saw, just looking at live deals in the Asia-Pacific region, not just the live deals in renewables. Now, it's a pipeline of about $290 billion. Now, many of these deal values have not yet, you know, come inside, we don't even have some of the dollar figures as yet, so that figure is likely to get substantially larger. And then we also saw the growth of emerging Asian markets in renewables with, for instance, renewables deals in both China and Vietnam increasing. Now, this is testament to just what you mentioned as well. Now, you know, staying with that particular theme of the emerging markets theme, you know, we've seen some developments over the past few years, few months, for instance, the Philippines has eased foreign ownership limits, and Vietnam has brought up this new power plant pushing renewables energy. Now, do you see this as creating opportunity all around, or do substantial challenges still remain? So, that's my question. And a follow-up would be, how about opportunities in, say, for instance, Indonesia? I think here in Southeast Asia, there has always been a very strong appetite for high-quality bankable projects. And there's also, you know, very competitive local capital available. Which shows, again, my first point, that even though we might have the current difficult market conditions, infrastructure has proven, again, resilience in the space. So, to invest in Southeast Asia, overall, if you compare to other countries, your setup costs are always a bit higher, and often you don't have, like, very strong government support. And that means you need to think about, you know, how you're going to make these deals scalable. And everybody has to get comfortable with the risk that we face, because this risk is a bit different. People might not be that familiar with it. And in my opinion, it's very important to have operational experience to de-risk these deals. So, what we have seen, you know, is that I think that one challenge for investors is to originate attractive, investable, renewable projects. And for sure, that's not easy, and that's not straightforward, because it needs a local network. And you also need to have experienced local developers that allow you to operate to the quality standards that you want to meet. And they are most often, you know, international standards that are required for investors. I think overall, it's great that, especially in the last years, and I think after COVID, Southeast Asia needed a bit to recover. But now we've seen that many countries have bledged, right, and committed to targets in the mid-to-long term. I think the Philippines, you know, one of the most liberalized markets here in Southeast Asia, allows a lot of different paths into the market. So there's auctions, right, and it took a while to set up this new system, which is also digital, which allows also to scale up different projects. It allows the development cycle to be shorter. You have other options to the market, just taking the merchant or contracting with a direct off-taker. So in my opinion, that different requirement now, not the 40% anymore, that will probably bring a really big push into the renewable sector in the Philippines. For Vietnam, I think many of us have been waiting for follow-up regulation, because there's such a big growth in the years where the feed-and-tariff scheme was active. So basically, entire Southeast Asia, you met in Vietnam, right, and it's amazing how many gigawatts per year they've built. So we're all happy that there's been now the new regulatory framework. And I think in the next couple of months, everyone will have to look at it and define, you know, what is the technology I think I want to invest in, and what is the path for us. It allows investors to have an opinion, you know, what should be a high-quality renewable power project, and what are the technologies that will be pushed in the mid to long term. So for Indonesia, Indonesia is also committed to net zero, right? And it has defined a five-plan step. How are they going to get there? I think they currently have a lot of thoughts around what to do with their coal plants and how to retire them early. And they are open for investment. So yesterday, I've been to a dinner where a minister just said, you know, we're ready, we really want to do it. And we invite everybody to come with very good solutions. And also, it was outlined, it's not only the renewable piece, it's also a nature-based solution to absorb emissions, because it's the third largest country after Brazil and China that can actually absorb most of the CO2 with forest rehabilitation. I think everybody, you know, doesn't matter which industry, which country, policy, we all have to work together to get this done, because probably it's not going to be an easy path. But I think as long as people want to solve problems, with steps, we're going to get there. So this is actually a very interesting opportunity for us to segue into the question that Celine is going to ask you. But I just wanted to quickly follow up on that. You mentioned scalability, scalability, many of the investors I've spoken with over the past year, year and a half, they have mentioned that there is quite the challenge as far as Southeast Asia concerning scalability as compared to other places such as India, for instance, South Asia, for instance. Do you see that to be true or things getting better in Southeast Asia? I think overall, it's true. I also think, you know, you can make things scalable if you bring an operational lens, right? Because if you start a company, you have different business model. If you diversify into different countries, you allow a company to tap into opportunities, windows of opportunities that open up because of regulation or because of a different movement in electricity prices. So in my opinion, you can create scalability. It can either come from diversifying in different regions, it can come from diversifying in different business models, and it can come from operational experience and excellence because you need to mainstream your processes as you have to do it in any industry to create scale and reduce cost per kilowatt that you build in a renewable space. That's super, super interesting, Valerie, and thanks for giving us such a frank and honest assessment of the situation. Now, just bringing in Selene, Selene, you had a question for Valerie. Go ahead. Hi, Valerie. So BlackRock, as we have seen, has opted to invest in local platforms such as in Taiwan and South Korea. So would you consider a similar approach for emerging Asian markets? Yeah, thanks a lot, Selene. So I think here I want to go back a bit into the strategy that is behind this, right? So like for us, we also like scalability, but we feel comfortable with taking development risk because we know how to de-risk it. And that's the reason why we invest in platforms to have the ability to step in and then do follow-ups, because at one point, these infrastructure players, they will require a lot of capital. And then once it comes, you know, it allows us to deploy either more of our capital or it also allows us to bring co-investors in and build even a bigger platform. So I think the approach of investing into platforms has also a de-risking factor because you diversify it. You can aggregate below one platform, different business models, and you could even let different platforms with different skills work together. And we've seen that in the OECD markets where we see different cycles of the business model. So let's take just one example, right? There might be one company that is really good in building batteries, but then in another country, that business model is not that mature. So it's actually not the technical skill to do that. What it allows us is to connect these two and let the technical skill help, you know, in another country to ramp up that business model as well. And I think this approach works also really well for Southeast Asia. And it could even work, you know, across a portfolio where you have OECD and non-OECD companies together. Because in this case, you would also de-risk different currencies, different business models, and you could learn from each other because you might be in different points in your life cycle. I wanted to just touch on the, you know, Celine brought this up as well, and you brought it up previously as well, local partnerships with local developers, right? So how important is it in a region like Southeast Asia, or is there any particular region in the whole of Asia-Pacific that you think is more key than in others to have local partners? Yeah, I think like creating a successful business has always two main pillars. The first one is being very local, right? The things are in a local language and you have different culture. So in my opinion, a successful developer is fully embedded in the network of that local country. And then you match this with international experience. And I think for us as international investors, it's our responsibility to help with that piece, right? Because if you, let's say, take an example, we have a small local developer and maybe the volume they buy for equipment is not that high. That means for every time they buy, they don't get an ideal price, right? But if we pool a lot of these companies together, we can get a better price for each of them, which is the benefit for all of their businesses. Same point is with terms like negotiation, different terms, because like equipment is not only about the price, right? It also needs to come with quality and other elements. So even there, your negotiation power is different if you're a local small company versus if you have like a couple of them combined and a bigger voice. Then I think the third part of being international, which is also important, is like optimizing all your financing solutions, right? Because these projects run on 70% leverage. That means like the bigger the volume you can negotiate, the better financing terms you will get as well. And then the third one, currently, you know, all our funds are Article 9 funds. And in our blended finance instrument, we have a very, very strong ESG framework. And that's what is our responsibility is to bring that ESG and Article 9 into all our investments because we believe moving forward, their value will increase a lot to deliver, to report on these standards. So I think a combination of being very local, very embedded, very good network combined with international best practices is probably the best foundation for a company to grow and scale up. Very sound advice in my opinion as well. I've been covering this region for about 20 years and I couldn't agree more with you, Valerie. Now, moving on to renewables development. Now, do you see any opportunities as a result of Malaysia's decision to allow exports of renewable power to other countries, including specifically Singapore, for instance? Yeah, I think it was really good to see. I mean, the Singapore tender, right, has been announced some while ago. But in my opinion, at least, I mean, I've lived here six years now and I'm always impressed. Even though I'm German, you know, we plan a lot. But I think Singapore is still a different level. So in my opinion, I'm very convinced that this will happen at one point of time, right? And it should happen wherever you find the cheapest cost of energy. And there are different countries, they are very close to Singapore. And I think all of them are in a really great position to build renewable power and deliver it to Singapore's industry. In my opinion, you know, there's a win-win, right? Because it doesn't matter if it's Malaysia or Indonesia, or it can be Laos, Vietnam. There's a lot of discussion around where will it come from. But it will create then locally jobs, right? And also that value creation will be in these countries, which I think is really powerful. And then having an off-taker Singapore, which is very credit-worthy, I believe the financing industry will be very excited about this big, large-scale projects. Thanks for that, Valerie. And then, you know, what you were mentioning kind of hits home, because I lived in Singapore, as you know, for about eight years, from, I think, the year 2001 to 2008, December. And I did see the, you know, the extensive planning. That was a time when Lee Kuan Yew was Minister, Mentor, Goh Chok Tong was the Prime Minister. And much before the days when Lee Hsien Loong became Prime Minister, we see that a lot of planning happening in Singapore, which actually is quite good. It gives you a lot of policy uncertainty. And now moving on to something else. Valerie, I know you follow the market very, very closely. Now, while a tightening interest rate environment has crimped lending somewhat, I see the project finance market appearing to be fairly insulated from this. And it is definitely open for business. I've spoken to many investors and people smarter than me as far as knowledge about the debt market is concerned. And they're saying that the tightening interest rate environment hasn't really affected the project finance market. Now, looking at also the inflationary environment, how does BlackRock see this impacting infrastructure investments as a whole? Yeah, thanks a lot for the question. So we're actually thinking a lot about the current environment. And I think the first point I want to point out is that infrastructure provides very stable income no matter of the economic cycle, because most of this is contracted in the mid to the long term. So overall, it tends to perform very well in this environment. And often these contracts are also inflation protected. And if you look at historical historical data, it has pretty much outperformed the traditional asset class in periods where you see high inflation. So for the investments we make, right, we go in very early stage, but then the costs are not locked in and also the offtake is not locked in. That means at that point of time, when you lock in the costs, you can take the current view of the environment at that point of time and sign an offtake agreement where you either link it to inflation or where you find a very beneficial way for you to levelize this out. So I think overall, coming back to my earlier point, it really diversifies your portfolio and still, you know, being the same that almost you see in a fixed income product. So even though we are talking a lot about inflation at the moment, I have not seen deal flow slow down. I think the demand still for good, high quality products, projects, and even companies is still very high. I think the number of transactions has gone down a bit, but I think you see still premiums are paid for opportunities that provide high upside and provide really good projects on a continuous basis. So I mean, just a quick follow up on that one, if I read this right, so what you're saying is basically that high quality assets still demand, still will have no trouble getting financing even in a high interest rate environment, even in a tightening market. But overall, do you see that while, you know, while margins may be squeezed a little bit, do you see this as an opportunity for some people to slightly de-risk, for instance, are they becoming more concerned about the quality of projects? Yeah, I would agree with that statement. I think now investors look a lot more into project pipelines, right? I mean, for existing projects, it's very easy to evaluate what is the offtake, like what's the currency, how good is that asset technically. I think for pipelines in the past, it was very easy to look at the pipelines and give them a high value. But I think now people or investors look a lot more in detail and evaluate, you know, how far are these projects developed and what kind of value can we assign to them? So what is actually that push through rate in a project pipeline? Valerie, this has been an excellent conversation. But before I let you go, I'm just going to put you on the spot a little bit. Looking at Asia EM, for instance, top three destinations that you think as far as investments are concerned as in potential returns on investment? Yeah, so I think like in my opinion, you need a diversified approach, right? Like for me, I really like the Philippines. I think you cannot ignore Vietnam because it's just a very, very big market. And then I'm also very interested in a large scale tender that will come up for Singapore. So I'm really looking forward, you know, to see this combination of countries moving forward and doing more renewable power projects. That's good to hear. This is an opinion shared by several smart people in the industry. Valerie, thank you so much for talking to us. I'm based in Hong Kong, so I'm assuming that you will visit Hong Kong from Singapore at some point. Love to meet, have a cup of coffee and talk infrastructure. Thank you very much, Valerie, for joining us. That sounds wonderful. Thank you very much.

We're really excited today to welcome Jean-Valéry Patin, co-head of Energy Resources and Infrastructure at BNP Paribas, to talk to us about the bank's lending strategy, particularly with a view to energy security, the climate crisis, and sustainability. Welcome to the podcast, Jean-Valéry. Good morning, everybody. So, Jean-Valéry, you've been with the bank for approximately, is it 23, 24 years now? That's right. You must have seen quite a lot of change in the bank's strategy in that time, in the lending activity of the bank, the types of projects, the types of sectors that you're covering. Tell us a little bit about how BNP's lending strategy has changed over your time with the bank. Yeah, obviously, over 24 years, it's changed a little bit. I always joke that I haven't changed company, but my job has changed, has itself changed quite a bit. I guess, you know, what we're doing today is a lot broader than what we used to do, both in terms of sectors, because the team started more as a power sector, but also in terms of product, because the team started really as a bank lending activity only. And today, we have a broad array of sectors that we cover and a broad array of products, including capital market products and derivatives products, among others. Fantastic. What are BNP's current plans to move with the times to adapt to the current needs of the infrastructure and energy sectors? You know, in my time covering infrastructure here at Infologic, we've seen a lot of shift from the traditional kind of toll road financing through to a large expanse of digital infrastructure, renewable energy, and now kind of energy transition deals as well. What's BNP doing to move with the times and to update its lending strategy? The company has embarked on a very public journey of transitioning and pivoting its activity. And besides those decisions at, you know, the top level of the house and strategic vision, I think the other important component that you can also feel with the people at the bank and also with the people that we even recruit, that they feel that they are part of that journey. They are enthusiastic about that, and I am certainly as well. And I think that combination is a winning combination to achieve the, you know, ambitious goals that the bank has set for itself. And how does that involve perhaps new technologies that we're seeing in the energy space? And how are commercial lenders incentivizing the development of those technologies that are going to form the basis of our future economy? I think that the topic of technology, to be honest, is one that we've always had. You've had continued changes and adaptation to technologies in our industry. Here, we're looking at, you know, continuing that work, but in the context of a journey toward that energy transition. So there is a clear pivot in our activity with stated goals, which is going to lead us to do less in certain areas and more in other areas and use our capital as well as our resources throughout those selected segments. You know, starting with renewables, you know, the bank has, you know, set a objective of growth for 2025 that are of rapid growth. And so we're working towards achieving that. It's true for utility scale projects that we've been doing for a while now, but it's also true of distributed generation, because a couple of weeks ago, another Chilean distributed generation transaction, which is, you know, the third that we've closed. And we've got another one that we're working on just to give an example. And also, obviously, on the backing of all that we've done in Europe, in offshore, we are working to position primarily in the United States on some offshore projects. We've supported Vignette Wind and there will be a lot more to come. The area of renewable itself has some subsegments. You've also probably noted that more and more of the renewable projects come associated with batteries, you know, for a number of reasons. So we've financed renewable associated with batteries as well as standalone batteries, particularly in California. Yeah, that's a really essential component of the renewable sector, isn't it? Battery storage and battery capacity, if you like. How are you seeing that playing out? Are you seeing enough being done? I was at a Reuters event last week. It was all about energy transition. And it seemed like a lot of the people were saying that things just weren't moving fast enough. That seems to have been the message from the conference. Do you feel that things are moving fast enough in the implementation of these technologies? In terms of the speed, I can mostly opine of the speed at being prepared by itself. And it's been rather a fast change that we've experienced. If you look only three years ago at where we were in terms of our sector mix to today, that's been quite fast. I think in terms of batteries, there's a key question that comes at play is a little bit, you know, the economic feasibility as well. Over time, probably the cost of the batteries, similarly to the solar panels, will trade down. And maybe at some point you will be able to achieve a greater portion of the energy stability through those batteries. It came to my attention that in addition to the numerous projects that we supported in California, including the Edward Sanborn deal last year, we were contacted in recent weeks for a bid situation in Chile for a project of around 600 million of battery to back up a transmission line. That's the first one that we're looking at really in Chile. So it shows probably that this is expanding. Now, every country, every geography will probably do it at a different speed. Some have a very supportive regulatory framework, as we've seen in California, which have allowed us to deploy capital in a number of transactions. You know, some have certain, you know, physical geographical constraints. If you look at, you know, the shape of the geographical shape of Chile as an example, that makes those batteries particularly interesting. And tying the two elements we were just discussing, they can actually be coupled with the distributed solar projects, which would be an interesting development. So what kind of new technologies are we seeing implemented today in the infrastructure space to contribute to that energy transition, Jean-Ballerin? So besides the traditional activity on the renewable side, I think we've got a couple of areas. The carbon capture is an interesting one, green hydrogen and ammonia. So this is a sector we spend some time on. The IRA Act in the US is providing very clear incentives for the production of green hydrogen, which is, you know, as we know today, very vastly derived from fossil activities. And it is true also of some other countries. Chile has started to try to develop also a little bit of a hub in the hydrogen, taking advantage of a strong natural resource. So that's an area where we're acting both in that advisory capacity as well as in arranging capacity. At the beginning, some of the projects are very large. And so you need to be able to put a structure to them, which in some cases includes, you know, not just the wind farm and the electrolyzer, but even, you know, building a port or even access road. So they can be a relatively pharaonic project at times. And then obviously having a structure that's bankable enough to to then raise financing. Those financing might be, you know, from commercial banks, but in many cases, it will also involve development financing institutions such as ECAs or multilaterals. I mean, you know, for instance, based on where the electrolyzer is being produced. So there was a large project like that that was done in Saudi Arabia. And there is a number of projects that we are working on. And the idea, you know, is that this could then be used, you know, as a fuel in a number of industries. So many use are being studied. You know, it could be used in shipping, probably further down the road for airplanes. You know, it has some use in refinery processes, et cetera, et cetera. Now, in terms of the bankability, you know, many times what we need to develop right now besides the construction aspect is to have a bankable off the agreement that offer an anchor and that allows to mobilize large, large financing. So I think that's one of the challenges in that area of this exciting sector for for the bank and for the market. And you mentioned the bankability of the projects there. I think that's something that's key, isn't it? At what point do we see project finance in green hydrogen projects? Are you working? You said you have some mandates potentially with with clients. Could you tell us maybe without any specifics if you're constricted on that point? But if you if you'd like to mention kind of what it's going to take for those projects to become bankable in project finance terms, you mentioned the offtakers, for example. Yeah, I'll take the two to keep it relatively simple. I mean, three areas. I mean, one, you need all the permitting done the right way, including importantly, environmental permits. Right. And that in itself can take time. So that's an important factor and needs to be to be done respecting, you know, local finance, local population, et cetera. The second one is related is related to construction. You know, these projects sometimes are so large that you're taking the actualizers to another level. Right. So, you know, which requires a strong diligence on the construction aspect. And also you have different kind of players in terms of the financial strength that produces actualizers, which is another another element of that construction risk. And then the third one, finally, as you mentioned, is an offtake contract to be able to to give an anchor that provides a certain stability to raise an amount of debt and alleviate a little bit the capital spending for the sponsors. So, you know, the project that's now closed in Saudi Arabia, for instance, I don't offtake of our products. Right. So it could be that you have an anchor investor. It could be that you have several offtakers. But at the end of the day, you do need to have a bit of a stability to the revenue that will allow to immobilize senior debt. Excellent. One of the other things that's interesting me as I delve ever deeper into the infrastructure sector and watch these new technologies being implemented and built up on those large utility scales is how investing and lending to traditional core infrastructure assets like toll roads and ports can contribute positively to the energy transition. What are you seeing in how those assets are evolving to incorporate new technologies and not just in the energy sector, but also including digital infrastructure technologies, perhaps? Yes. I mean, I haven't really seen that myself, but I've heard about, you know, some projects where they were, for instance, developing some roads in Europe and yet on the road itself, you had a way to cut the solar radiation. To be honest, we haven't seen that here yet. But what we can see is that everybody is trying, I'd say part of that journey is really a transition. So even when you look at our clients, it's not just where they stand today and what their mix of sectors is, it's where they want to be and what concrete steps they're taking towards that journey and where they want to be in five years or in 10 years. And when you look at that, you're seeing that a lot of the actors and certainly the one that we are focusing on have some objective. For instance, they will decide that they conduct a certain activity and they will source green power. And that could be true for, you know, data centres that will source it from green power, but it could also be true for other near-shoring manufacturing activities, you know, in the US or even in Mexico. And that's what we're really trying to support. OK, and that leads on nicely to my next question of how you think the industry is going to change in the next five to 10 years to accommodate these different elements, the near-shoring, as you said, the use of green energy for projects, sourcing green energy in particular. What kind of changes do you think are coming in the next five to 10 years that maybe are quite novel or innovative? So, I mean, more on the financing side of it, we do expect that the prevalence and growth of institutional investors will continue to increase. In that sense, the market in the Americas is particularly developed, right? We already have a majority of the financing that are provided by those actors. And when you look at all the fundraising activity that has occurred with, you know, a very large double-digit billion fund by many parties, including many of them with a clear orientation towards the energy transition or the digital sectors that we covered before. Certainly, you know, we think that that will be important when we work on that. For us, what's interesting is that both sides are clients to BNP, right? You get the sponsors that develop the project and then we might, you know, support the construction or, you know, the acquisition of such project. And then they might be taken out to the market, which, you know, are also clients of BNP. So we really view our role as, you know, facilitating the development and also in that process, bringing expertise. Like we've got a long history of knowing how to analyze a project and doing due diligence, which is important because another thing that probably is going to develop is new sectors. So we mentioned briefly gigafactories, for instance. So this is relatively new, right? And these are projects of also a couple of billion dollar apiece, right? And so as you deploy that capital, whether it's capital from commercial banks or in some project in that sector, the Department of Energy in the United States, you need to make sure also that, you know, you suddenly you move relatively fast, but you also don't do a mistake that could then have the effect of basically limiting the flow of financing to those sectors. And that's also that expertise that we've built through the numerous decades and the processes and the analysis of those projects. Excellent. As you mentioned, the large amounts of capital that's being leveraged from infrastructure funds and also debt funds. What can the public sector do to take advantage of this available capital? And we know here in the United States, when you mentioned regulation, we've seen the Inflation Reduction Act, the IIJA. So there's plenty of legislation here that's injecting capital towards the sector. How do you feel that that's being handled? And is the public sector doing the right kind of things to facilitate the investment from all of the capital that's being raised by those asset managers? To deploy the capital, you need clear rules of the game, stability of regulation. So the fact that you have, for instance, a vision up to 2030, which allows you to make an investment today and have some stability, that's really important. I think it's applicable to all the countries. What sponsors or investors or banks don't like is the noise and things changing all the time because they are making decisions today on the basis of a given situation. And if it changes after the fact, then that's a surprise. Well, that's not going to be very welcome. So developing that stability, which obviously gives an edge to the countries that have always had a stable regulatory framework, is a big asset. Excellent. And as a final point, how optimistic are you that the financial sector is playing a positive role in the energy transition and addressing climate change? And is there anything more that you think that your sector could do to contribute to those goals? So the financing sector is very broad. Yes. It's going to be difficult to cover all of it. But BNP has certainly been at the forefront of taking difficult decisions, and some of them were done in the last few weeks, sometimes even renouncing project bond mandates, if we consider that this is with players that are not seriously engaging towards that transition. So we're clearly, we've taken some relatively strong decisions and a very clear direction. What we see is that a number of other actors are also taking measures to support the energy transition. That's what we need, right? Because as much as we have the biggest bank in Europe, you need all the actors together to push in that direction. And so hopefully the more we embark on that journey, the more pressure it puts on the others to follow suit. Excellent. Well, those are some really interesting points. So thank you very much for sharing that with our listeners here at Crossroads. We appreciate you coming on the show. Thank you. That's all we have time for today. Be sure to stay tuned for future episodes of Crossroads. I'd like to thank our guests, Sean Valerie Patan and BNP Paribas, and we look forward to receiving you next time.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2023-04-17 16:21:13+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Launching a new renewable firm\n**Episode ID:** 4373\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the Crossroads podcast. This is Andrew Vitelli, your host. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest today is Cassidy Deline, the founder and CEO of Linea Energy. Cassidy founded Linea in November, and earlier this year, the firm secured a significant capital commitment from NCAP Investment. Cassidy, thank you for joining us today. Thank you for having me, Andrew. Happy to be here. Oh, great. So, Cassidy, I want to get into the founding of your company and where you're focused. But first, can you talk a little bit about your background in the energy sector before founding Linea? Sure, absolutely. I have been in the energy sector since there was just two gigawatts total of solar installed in the US. So, I have seen the ups and downs of this industry. So, a change in tax law passed literally the eve before trying to close a big tax equity transaction, been through the ups and downs of model tariffs. And now we're, I think, really entering a new phase of renewable energy development in the US. We have the IRA behind us, and it feels like the industry has just had a lot of gasoline poured on it. But that comes with a number of challenges as well as opportunities. And so, where there was 2 gigawatts installed when I started in this industry, we're now looking at single projects that are a good portion of that. And if you look at where we need to go and what we need to add to the grid as an industry in terms of renewable deployment and also storage deployment, we need to continue to accelerate. We need to continue to get better and faster at what we've been doing. And prior to Linea, I was Chief Commercial Officer at Cypress Creek and helped build that company and take it through the successful sale to EQT. I'm very proud of what we did there and what we accomplished and what that team continues to accomplish. And prior to that, I was also on the team at Recurrent Energy that took Recurrent through the sale to Canadian Solar. So, my background is really being at developers in the building process and in the scaling process and then taking that through a successful monetization event. So, I'm excited to be doing that literally from the starting line at Linea and excited to see where it goes. So, until last year, you were still with Cypress Creek and then you made the decision to leave and to start a new company from scratch, which, of course, is a very daunting task in any industry, particularly one like renewables that's so dynamic. Can you talk about that decision? What made you want to build something from the ground? Curiosity, in part. Really, the desire to start from the very beginning, which is not something that I had done at Cypress or Recurrent. I also... As I mentioned, I think the industry is at a turning point. And there's a number of things that all of us at Linea who have deep backgrounds across the renewable space are bringing from our prior careers and our prior experiences in terms of best practices. But there's also things that we think we can push on and the things that we think we can change. And so it was really that opportunity to start with a blank slate, to pull back the covers on the development process and really make sure that we're pressure testing every step of the process to make sure it makes sense, to ask ourselves if we can do it better, how we can change it. And it was that desire to really think critically about not just the end product, but also the process and improving that process that led me to Linea. And I think a lot of our listeners and Infralogix readers work in or have worked with the energy sector and the renewable energy sector, but probably only a handful have done what you've done, which is start a firm from scratch and get a major investment. What did that take? What was that like? What experience would you relate to somebody else who's thinking of doing that? I will say that there are small things that I didn't necessarily appreciate before that I now appreciate quite a bit, like having internet in an office or having healthcare. All of those things take a tremendous amount of time and energy. And it's a really incredible learning experience going through all of that. I feel incredibly lucky to have NCAP as our equity partner and really our partner in doing this. And they ask the right questions, they push us in all of the right ways. And so not only do they provide us the rocket fuel to grow the business, but they're also a really amazing thought partner. And I think we will continue to learn from them, which is a very, very exciting place to be. Well, thank you, Cassidy. And it will be very exciting to watch. So when we last spoke, you told me that by post-2026, you expect the firm to develop at least 1 gigawatt per year of generation and storage projects. Now there are a lot of renewables firms, a lot of renewable focused developers out there. Where does Linea fit in? And where do you see opportunities? And where do you see maybe parts of the market that aren't being filled right now? This is a crowded space. And we're very clear eyed about that. We also... I know that any project, there's a million things that can go wrong. And it's not a matter of when you get that, when you wake up and you have a day where something has gone drastically wrong on a project. It's a matter of the tools in your toolkit and how quickly you can recover and rebound from that. And that's really what makes a good and an enduring developer. For Linea, we have a team with really deep experience. And we're really excited about the team that we've built and that we're building across finance, across development, across technologies, and bringing together some common but also diverse experiences to take the best of those. We're incredibly committed to the concept of continuous improvement. And we're truly looking at every step of the development process to figure out how we can make it faster, how we can make it better, how we can have more conviction around the projects that we are advancing through our pipeline. So what that means is we're taking a bit of a money ball approach to development. We're very analytical and analysis heavy. Analysis heavy in the early part of the process so that we have... That we're arming ourselves with as much information as we possibly can before we even make the first call to a landowner. And if you look at attrition rates in the industry today, those are likely only going to go up because of the status of the queues, because of the increasing negative sentiment towards renewables and local communities. And so we think that with more information, with more analysis, we can develop smarter and we can develop faster. We're also seeing an opportunity in the M&A marketplace. This is a year of capital recycling across the industry. And there's a number of companies that are selling down portions of their portfolio or minority stakes in their portfolio. And we see an opportunity in that. Well, thank you for that, Cassidy. And I know that Linnea is going to focus across wind, solar, and storage. Is there more of a focus on one technology than any other? And do you see opportunities for other renewable resources in the future? We definitely think of ourselves as a company that's committed to the energy transition. And what I mean by that is that there's no one technology that is going to enable this transition. We're very focused on designing and building a portfolio that works to mitigate risks across assets. Or said differently, having specific projects that are either differing technologies or in locations that have disassociated risks and actually help mitigate the downside case. So we're using our portfolio as a bit of a natural hedge against other projects and thinking about projects that may be on the opposite side of a binding constraint in terms of geographic siting, or obviously various technologies, whether wind or solar have differing generation profiles. And storage is a clear risk offsetting characteristic relative to the generating technologies. We are actively looking at other technologies. And we'll add that to our plan and our pipeline as we continue to develop. So one word that I think I've used more than maybe any other in this podcast and in my writing to a large degree when describing the renewables sector is cross currents. Because over the last few years, you've seen a lot of positives and a lot of challenges in the sector. The positives obviously are continuing interest in expanding renewable generation, continuing and growing interest among corporates for renewable offtake. And then, of course, the Inflation Reduction Act, which created all these incentives and opportunities. But at the same time, I think there have been challenges in the sector that the sector really hasn't seen since it started growing at the rate it has been. And among these, I think first and foremost, has been supply chain issues over the last few years. And that includes challenges with trade. That includes just shortages, increasing prices, overall inflation. And now on top of that, you also have rising interest rates, which have really affected particularly the M&A market. Where do you see the overall state of the renewable industry right now? How do you see these opportunities and these challenges interacting? There's a lot of turmoil in the market right now that has been introduced by the tail of supply chain issues. But we're seeing that start to turn back in favor of developers, both with regard to dropping lithium pricing, as well as dropping silicon pricing, and the effect on the core technologies. We're seeing that with the interest rate environment, which is also affecting the macro economy. What is interesting about this industry is that we haven't yet really seen that affect the aggregate pool of liquidity, at least for bank debt. I think that we are going to start to see that. And we will see lenders become more selective on the deals that they choose to lend to. But so far, the impact on pricing has been relatively minimal in terms of spreads. Of course, there's been a massive uptick over the last year in terms of the base rate. It's my personal opinion that we're going to start to see that rise in interest rates abate, given some of the turmoil in the bank markets of late, which will be obviously beneficial to the industry if that does come to pass. And then you have IRA, which is this massive, incredibly powerful policy that gives the industry a long term horizon to plan to in terms of the tax credits. But it's also introduced an incredible amount of uncertainty, particularly given the delays in some of the guidance. We did just get guidance this morning from the White House and from the Treasury on the energy communities, which is very positive. So now at least we have something concrete that we can work towards, and that we can plan on. And we're still waiting on guidance on some of the other important aspects with regard to the IRA. So how do you approach that as an energy firm? The fact that there is this massive bill with all these incentives, and there's going to be a rush to tap them. But at the same time, there's uncertainty in exactly how to do that. There has to be somewhat of a balance between, do I wait for clarity? Or do I make sure I'm not missing opportunities? Yeah, absolutely. It's really hard. And I mean, this is an industry that's all about calculated risks. And so it's making those calculated risk decisions and not making the ones that are going to be too punitive. I think that from my perspective, some of the delay that we've seen with regard to the guidance has likely slowed the industry down. People have been waiting for that guidance. And so that for Linnea, given that we're starting from square one, it is not necessarily a bad thing, because that gives us a chance to catch up. And what are some of the biggest question marks that remain when you talk about these guidances that you and others in the industry are still awaiting? The guidance around domestic content and the adder associated with domestic content is very important. You have manufacturers that are moving forward with plans to build domestic content manufacturing facilities. But we don't yet have the guidance in terms of what will enable equipment to actually qualify if that's going to be at the component, i.e. the module or the subcomponent level. I see. So that's a big, big component of these projects. And it'll be hard to work through a project without that guidance in place. And then the other factor when you talk about these cross currents, although I guess even within the IRA, there are cross currents. But on the subject of the supply chain, that's something when I've been talking to people in the industry, it's really one of the biggest issues, especially early last year was, do you have supply to build these projects? How do you handle that as a new firm? Do you have a consistent supply? Is that something that's always on your mind on a project to project basis? It is, of course, something that's always on our mind. We are also thinking about supply chain on a project by product basis, yes, but also on a longer term basis and thinking toward the longer term vision and making sure that we're supporting that in terms of our supply chain discussions. We do have a very unique position with our sponsor in NCAP and the relationships that they bring to the table in terms of supply chain that puts us in a preferential position relative to startups that may not have the benefit of those deep relationships. And how closely are you watching some of the policy issues on that front, both the way customs is enforcing the Uyghur forced labor prevention act and also the oxen case, which obviously there was a, I think it was a two year hold on any potential countervailing tariffs. But now there's about a year left. And I imagine for certain projects that's going to start to become a concern again. Yeah, it's absolutely going to become a concern again for the timeline of our projects. We assume that we're going to be right on the cuffs of that hold on the anti-circumvention issue. So we're monitoring that very closely. It's very complicated and you have to go into the bill of materials and all the way down the supply chain. So that's something that we're monitoring very closely. And I think it's our general opinion that we will see some sort of parity in pricing between Southeast Asia, which obviously will not qualify for the domestic content adder and the pricing from suppliers that do offer domestic content modules. Right now you see pricing that's really across the board. And I think that in the next coming years, we're going to see more consolidation and that pricing start to reach parity as you look at the economic benefits of the two options. All right. Well, definitely something to keep our eyes on. And you mentioned the M&A market right now. Obviously it's been an interesting year for the last year and a half or so in the M&A market. But when I've been speaking to people in the market, I've heard that it's gone from somewhat of a seller's market to a buyer's market. And that a lot of the platforms that are coming to the market now aren't getting the same type of interest in part because of some of these headwinds and in large part because of rising interest rates. I'm also hearing there's a little bit of a disconnect in some cases between what sellers are expecting based on the way that things were a year ago and what buyers are willing to pay. And I think that the Inflation Reduction Act is also a factor here in that there is so much potential and so much uncertainty that it's natural for buyers and sellers to have somewhat different views of how to price that in. How do you see the M&A market right now? I think we have seen a little bit of a flip towards more of a buyer-friendly market. That said, we were starting from the opposite extreme. We were starting from a place that was really a seller's market and where sellers could command the price that they wanted. So I see it a little bit more as a correction. And the factors that have pushed that correction are where we are in terms of the macro economic climate and interest rates. These are fixed assets and the spread between debt and equity has gotten much tighter, which makes the returns on the projects much tighter. That may not be at the forefront of a developer's mind when they're thinking in terms of cents per watt of a development fee. But it does very much affect real project returns. And then of course, supply chain has really just slowed things down. And I think that supply chain is an opportunity for buyers as well to make themselves competitive on a non-price basis by offering certainty of project advancement. I think to add to that, those are maybe the first issues to overcome in the M&A market. But there's all of the uncertainty that IRA brings. And IRA has... While it has increased the value of your average project, it has also decreased the value of the electron that that project delivers to the grid. Really because of the surge of renewables that we see coming onto the grid. And so this is something that Linnea is very, very focused on as we think about what solar and wind capture rates will be in the future for around the clock pricing. And I think that is also a dynamic that still needs to be processed in the industry as a whole. And then you have situations like Texas, where the Texas legislature is contemplating this incredibly punitive package of bills to the renewables industry. The most punitive of which would require renewables to be decommissioned and come off the grid by 2027. And then varying all the way to a new permitting regime and 500-foot setbacks. And so those are very, very binary risks when you're talking about buying or advancing a project. And I think that we need to, as an industry, continue to remind the local communities that we participate in that we are investing in the communities. There's millions of dollars of property taxes that are funding local schools, funding local governments. And that this wave of renewables is not antagonistic to the communities. But specific to M&A, risks like that cannot be binary to the seller. They have to be shared by the seller and the buyer. And of course, we hope that in this specific case of this package of bills in front of the Texas legislature, that common sense prevails and that many of these do not advance. That's just another specific example of what needs to be thought of and structured into some of these transactions. Well, thank you so much for all that, Cassidy.

I'm Eugene Gilligan, Senior Reporter at Infralogic. Our guest on the podcast is Kevin Cox, CEO of Ferrovial Vertiports. Vertiports are essential infrastructure for electric vehicle takeoff and landing aircraft. Kevin has joined us to bring us up to date on Vertiports and what milestones are ahead for this interesting technology. Hello, Kevin, and welcome. Thanks Eugene. I appreciate it. Thanks. So why don't you talk about how the site selection is going for Vertiports? What key metrics do you look at when considering site selection? Excellent question. Multiple things. It first begins and ends with what we believe is kind of the secret sauce that Ferrovial has built over the last four or five years, which is a fairly sophisticated demand model that looks at big data, telephone data, where people are traveling between point A and point B. We can tell how long it's taking. We can tell if it should be an hour, why is it taking an hour and a half, purpose of trip, and then we can slice and dice that kind of data to build what we believe is a very conservative but sophisticated, like I indicated, demand model of where there are opportunities for us to save people travel time, whether they're traveling by their own car, a taxi, a bus, a train, and sometimes even a plane. And then we have a predictive algorithm model that has been developed over years that allows us to assess the likelihood of being able to willingness to pay and value of time and how that will lead to potential evital traffic between two particular points on a map. And then from there, we look to build out not just one location or two, but a network no different than an airline that's looking to build that out. So the first is we would never build or construct or operate a VertiPort if we didn't believe there was thick markets, demand opportunity, and commercial viability for ultimately whoever the operator or operators that may be serving that VertiPort. The second though is not just demand, but making sure that that site is conducive for first and last mile. It does us no good to save somebody 30 minutes of travel time if they can't get to their ultimate destination or they're sitting at a VertiPort waiting to find a connection to wherever they're ultimately destined for. And then the third and final main three is to ensure it's cost effective. One of our goals is to ensure as part of this ecosystem that's looking to transform how people move to, through, and between cities is to make sure it's cost effective for the operators and ultimately for the customers. So those are really, you know, the three kind of primary points that we look for when we're trying to begin and develop a network. What infrastructure requirements are in a VertiPort? What has to be in them? Well, it is similar to an airport, but on a micro size. So, you know, I came from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport where we had 25,000 acres and we can build a VertiPort on an acre to have a one FOTO stand and two, I should say one FOTO, which is a takeoff and landing area, and two stands where you have the aircraft waiting to either take off or may have just landed and is deplaning. You need a small terminal building for inclement weather and you need to be able to ensure that you've got the good ingress and egress. And so it really is a microcosm of what an airport is, but it also takes it beyond that. At the end of the day, as my team at Liz and Breeze, as we begin to work with some of the best designers and architects and engineers in the world is it can't look, feel, or act like an airport. It's got to feel and look like you're literally from the moment you arrive, within minutes you are boarding your Evita and you're taking off. So there are not the same kind of amenities that you would normally see at an airport where you've got large mall kind of in buying and selling you stuff. It really is about convenience and it really is about finding those locations, as we talked earlier, that are the thickest markets and because of that, you tend to be in the most congested areas. And so you very much just need a postage stamp so you have the ability to get people to and through and onto the aircraft. Is P3 a financing structure that can be used for port development? Could they be P3 projects? Absolutely. I mean, I think if this industry is going to take off, it's going to take off on a multitude of ways of financing, but P3 is absolutely, I would say, top of the list. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of public airports out there. There are lots of secondary and tertiary airports out there, but cities, counties, and municipalities don't have extra money sitting around to take an investment on a commercial flight that has never flown commercially in a completely different kind of context. Historically, cities and counties and others will invest in large airports. They tend to be much removed from population and this kind of puts aviation on its head and that's taking it to where the people are. And to do that, it takes somebody like ourselves and our company that understands how to build, how to operate, and how to run businesses and do it in a very effective manner. So, there will be situations where we will invest and build our own networks. I suspect there will be others out there that will be working collaboratively with municipalities and others or airports to the extent there's demand there. So, if this is going to be reliant on anything, it's going to be reliant on private money coming in and standing up this new form of transportation. Please talk about your recent agreement with EVE Air Mobility and how you see this advancing vertiports. We have a very, what we call, agnostic approach to aviation and EVTOLs and vertiports per se in that we recognize that there are multiple business models out there that are literally hundreds of EVTOL companies, some that have raised over a billion, billion and a half dollars, some that are still looking at paper airplanes and modeling how they would design and kind of build and bring something to market. We also recognize that there are different business models. Some are looking for air taxi, short haul traffic. Some are looking for longer haul connect cities. And kind of a third component is, as you've seen in the last year or so, airlines looking to get in it and how they could potentially feed their hubs or get passengers quickly to wherever they are operating the larger aircraft. All of those means our agnostic approach is finding those folks that we believe are most likely to succeed and bring stuff to the table that will help us stitch together a robust ecosystem. And EVE obviously, with the backing of Embraer, has got some expertise. They move a lot of stuff in and around Central and South America. And I've got some wonderful engineers and computer science folks that know how to do that. So we are collaborating with them, but we're also collaborating with lots of others. There are many other OEMs that we have what we have called NDAs with. Some of them are focused on con ops. Some of them are focused on the commercial commercialization of the aircraft. But at the end of the day, what we want to make sure is whether it's an EVE aircraft or a Joby or a Lilium or an Archer, that we can accommodate those aircraft at our vertiports and at our networks. And the only way to do that is to extend a hand and work collaboratively with all of those folks. 20thC is really the typical customer who would use EVE at all and vertiports. Any thoughts on that? I would argue it's going to evolve over time. I think like any technology, you will have those that are the first adopters. And given this is all about moving people as quickly as possible, those that value time and have the ability to pay will most likely be the first users, whether that is a businessman or a businesswoman trying to get quickly from point A in city to point B in city so they can can make their meeting. It could also in theory be commuters as well as people that simply may be traveling. An example is from arriving at Miami International Airport and wants to get to the cruise ships or wants to get to the keys or wherever the case is. So there are many different components, but it's all about value of time and convenience. Over time, we believe that this will ultimately become for the masses, but that's going to take some time, going to take some production and scaling and development and ultimately adoption by the consumer, realizing that they can more quickly and very efficiently and quietly and without any emissions and get hopping over what has traditionally been a very difficult place in any particular market. So my view is it's going to evolve over time, but it will start with those that are willing to pay a little bit more to get from point A to point B. About financing, Vertaport said, will you consider taking on an equity partner or partners or looking at other forms of financing to build them? Can you talk about that a little? Absolutely. So Ferrovial, about four or five years ago, began looking, as they always do, forward and through their innovation group, looking for opportunities to where they can take what we believe we do well, which is to build, finance, build and operate major transportation infrastructure. And they saw on the horizon that Evital technology was coming to fruition quite quickly and that allowed us to do what we do best, which is build that kind of infrastructure. So they are all in and dedicated to helping try to bring this transformative form of transportation to the marketplace. And they are using their own equity at this point to commit to various networks across the United States and Europe. Having said that, it's not a cheap endeavor when you're building micro Vertaports or micro airports in large cities and building networks. And traditionally, as Ferrovial has done in the past, whether it's been at JFK, at New Terminal One, or whether it's been at where they were the largest shareholder of London Heathrow, it is likely over time that we will bring in strategic partners that will not only bring capital, but bring expertise to help us fulfill our mission. So, you know, right now we're funding it ourselves. They're very committed to it, but in typical kind of Ferrovial capital diversification process, they're always looking for potential partners that may bring not only capital, but some expertise to the table. Now, as far as on the regulatory front, what regulations will need to be passed both on probably from the federal level and the state level to move Vertaports forward? What has to happen on that front? Let's start from the federal side and work down to the kind of state and local. The federal, there are really two kind of fundamental things that have to occur. One is actual certification of the aircraft. And there are many Evital companies that have raised significant amount of money that are going through that certification, whether that's through the FAA in the U.S. or whether that's the EASA in Europe, or whether it's in the United Kingdom with the CAA, they're going through these regulatory approval processes. And as with any kind of regulatory approval process, whether you're the FAA, EASA, or CAA, safety is paramount. So, they will ensure when these aircraft get certified, that they're as safe as any other aircraft out there. And I would argue safer than many because of the simplicity behind the design, because of the uniqueness of the technology, and because these have no single point of failure. So there's redundancy throughout these aircraft, but they will be going through that certification process. Some are projected to get certified as early as 2025. And when they get certified, we hope to have infrastructure in place to begin to stand this industry up. There's the certification of the aircraft piece. There's also the kind of guidelines and whether it will be necessary to build and operate a public vertiport. And the FAA, as an example, has Engineering Brief 105. It's their first review of what they believe is necessary to build the appropriate safety and facilities that will operate these. EASA has similar, but slightly different standards. Those will, if you're building a public vertiport, will have to meet all of those requirements. And we've reviewed them and quite honestly believe they're quite achievable and make lots of sense. And that's on the federal level. So you get your vertiport, you work with the FAA to ensure when you're citing something that you're integrating with the airspace and there are no issues and conflicts and that sort of stuff, this industry will start with visual flight rules, VFR. So no different than any aircraft taking off in VFR conditions. You'll work through all of those requirements that you have to check the box to operate your aircraft. The states, depending upon the state, may have some authority in terms of anointing whether or not there is a, quote, vertiport or a airport or whatever may case. But that seems to be and generally is less of an issue and more of a dot the I, cross the T, making sure that there is some oversight there. But at the end of the day, really this industry will not be hamstrung by the federal or the state. It will be completely dependent upon working with the local communities, explaining the benefits of this technology, and ultimately getting them to adopt, support, and want vertiports in their community. And that requires education, which we're out there doing today in the markets that we've initiated conversations with, explaining what it means, explaining how green it is, explaining how quiet it is. Because at the end of the day, it's all about the communities blessing the zoning, blessing the building of it, but then embracing it as a form of transportation. And really the local piece we believe is going to be the most critical piece of getting right and not going places where the community don't want us. Just the opposite. We want to be where people want the convenience, want the green, want this new form of transportation. So what will basically be your focus over the next 12 months working on vertiports? What are your goals? We are active on lots of fronts. We are in our second or third generation of our design as it relates to what a vertiport would look like, how we would operate. As I indicated earlier, we're working hand in glove with most of the major OEMs and operators that have shown interest on how we would actually operate these facilities. Who has what responsibility? How do we ensure the difference between the vertiport operator and the actual Evital operator? So we will be going through a series of design and refinements as well as con ops to make sure that we can accept any business model and we can accept any kind of operation. Simultaneously, we will be out there beginning and continuing to lease at locations where we believe are the perfect markets. We started in Florida. Our first lease is at West Palm Beach. We have other ongoing negotiations with a variety of potential sites in and about Florida. We've begun negotiations or I should say discussions working towards negotiations for sites in New York, New Jersey. We have ambitions of building networks in Southern California, Northern California at some point, Texas, as well as the United Kingdom, Spain, and potentially other parts of Europe. So you can't build all of it at once. We're going to be very focused and thoughtful as we go about it. But the next 12 months will continue to open up the leasing opportunities and lining up operators who are interested in serving those particular markets. Well, Kevin, I want to thank you for appearing here and giving us this information. It's quite a technology and we'll be watching it very closely. So it was very interesting. We appreciate your time. Well, Eugene, it's been my pleasure. And if I could leave you with anything, most people think that this is the Jetsons kind of pie in the sky mentality. The reality of it is this is transformative, but it is on the very near horizon and it will truly affect how people move as I've indicated. And we couldn't be more excited to be part of that ecosystem and technology. So we appreciate the time and I wish you all the best. Thank you so much. And thank you to our listeners for listening. And we invite you to subscribe to the Crossroads podcast. You can find this episode wherever you get your podcasts. Thank you.

I'm Gabriela Valente, reporter for Infralogic in Brazil. In this episode, we will discuss the Brazilian green hydrogen promising market. We'll be joined by Ricardo Gedra, Analysis and Information Manager at Brazil's Chamber of Electric Energy Commercialization, known as CCEE, and member of Switzerland's Green Hydrogen Organization Advisory Committee. Ricardo, thank you for joining us. Hi, Gabriela. It's a pleasure to be here talking to you about a so important aspect for the planet as hydrogen. Global decarbonization goals have field discussions regarding the role of green hydrogen to achieve a more sustainable energy matrix, and Brazil figures as one of the countries with the largest potential to produce green hydrogen and even export it to European countries and other markets. CCEE has developed a certification process to attest that the hydrogen production is coming from a low carbon source, aiming to achieve market demands and the international standards. Ricardo, could you walk us through the process of certification designed by CCEE and how it should contribute for the eventual exportation of green hydrogen? Yes, of course, Gabriela. As you said, Brazil is a potential exporter of hydrogen. Hydrogen and its derivatives, the word. But this exportation will only have value, will only have interest of the customer if the product has the associated environmental attribute. It's about this point that the certification adds value in this process. The certification or how to certify depends on the production process. So it depends on how the hydrogen is made. And in this initial version, this first version, CCEE certification covers only hydrogen produced through electrolysis, the technological route of electrolysis, which is the process that most companies are planning to use. However, in our roadmap, we are planning to cover other technological routes, but always with the focus of low carbon hydrogen, because this is the strategy here in Brazil, always using low carbon hydrogen. As we already have all the metering information and energy contracts here in CCEE, and we have this information because we are the official energy market operator here in Brazil. We use this information to verify the percentage of clean and renewable electricity used to produce hydrogen. At the end of this process, we will inform if it is 100% clean or if it has an associated carbon contact resulting from the electricity used. And for the next versions of the certification, we will expand this analysis to verify the emission, the existing carbon emission, right? Within the production process, which will be done with existing standards or using some standards under developing around the world. And it will be done through specialized companies in this type of activity. And there are many companies around the world already specialized to audit industrial process. To answer your question about the export contribution, hydrogen or its derivative, with this environmental attribute, we allow the buyers to have the certainty that they are decarbonizing their process. And this is the main value to contribute to export to this product. I would like to add just an additional point that we are following the European standard, European requirements in this initial version. Europe, and more specifically Germany, is the country that is making the first international purchase of this product. So with this certification, we created the opportunity for the national industry to participate of this process and also for the next one, the next purchase process around the world. That's very interesting. And Brazil also has a great market for renewables. So everything makes a lot of sense. Coming back to the certification process, how do you think that could help the financing of projects? Could it be an element for a green bond issuance or something like this? Yeah, sure. As I mentioned, this is an industry that is being born. So it's not yet mature to the point of having a structured financial products for the specific needs of this type of enterprise, this type of project. But even though certification can help to give security to investors that they are putting their money in an enterprise with low environmental impact, this issue is very important because the financial market currently does not invest more in projects with high environmental impact. For this reason, the certification will indicate to the investor the exactly carbon content and the percentage of renewable energy use. And of course, most of them, 100% of clean energy. With this visibility, anyone who is developing the project will certainly have the focus to achieve a low environmental impact. We have some companies that already announced their hydrogen projects in Brazil, such as Unigel, EDP, Prumo, and China Three Gorges. The German consulting firm, Rollenberger, is expecting an up to 5 million metric tons of hydrogen and annual production by 2030, added only by the announced projects. Rollenberger is also foreseeing in over $100 billion over the next 25 years, considering the CAPEX for electrolyzers and for the power plants itself. Ricardo, how do you perceive the domestic demand and the international demand for the green hydrogen produced in Brazil? Great, Gabriela. Let's talk about the national and the international. So as you said, the projections and the studies made by international consultants indicate for a billionaire market. For this reason, many companies are developing projects to attend this market in Brazil. There are already, I believe, dozens of memorandums of understanding signed between large companies and state governments for hydrogen production here in Brazil, hydrogen and its derivatives. These memorandums aim to advance in instructing projects near concentrated demands to justify investments. This type of demand is found in ports and industrial districts. When we talk about ports, it's not only to export, because in Brazil it's very common to have ports with a large industrial district together where there is demand for hydrogen. And about the international point of view, the air and maritime transport sectors, for example, are already organizing themselves with a voluntary decarbonization targets that include hydrogen and ammonia as key fuels for this goal. Because Brazil is an important global logistic hub, so this is also a market to be served. And some products with high energy intensity, which Brazil is already an exporter, also have the potential to use hydrogen. This is the case of steel, for example, which requires a lot of energy to heat the furnace with high temperatures with currently used fuels, nowadays with carbon emissions and hydrogen as an option. What do you think it should take for the Brazilian market to start materializing the exportation talks and when and how we should see it feasible to start supplying international markets considering that the domestic demand is also high? Yes, great. This is also a good question, Gabriela. The market should start where it's possible to take advantage of existing assets. For example, let's talk about the aviation industry, right? To change the fuel of an aircraft requires the design of a new aircraft, which is a very capital intensive product. So it's better to wait for the amortization of the capital already invested to change this asset and talk about assets, very expensive assets that we need to change. But on the other hand, some industries already use hydrogen nowadays, but hydrogen with associated carbon, such as fertilizer industry, for example. In this case, it's possible to take advantage of most of the assets and talk about the existing assets, only changing the origin of the hydrogen used. In this type of industry, the adoption of hydrogen must be faster all over the world. And talking about international markets, Europe and East Asia are pointed out as the biggest buyer market in the world, biggest importer. East Asia is not a competitive region from Brazil, from Brazilian hydrogen because of logistic reason compared to Australia and India, for example, which are closer and also because they are large countries that are planning to export hydrogen and they already have a plan to do that. Europe is the buyer market where we have more possibility to attend. Here in Brazil, we have more possibility to attend, which does not mean that we are in a comfortable situation as a country because the Middle East and North Africa, for example, also have the objective to attend this market. And they have good logistical conditions to do that related to Europe. And to finish this point and regarding the part of your question about when this market will be operational, I would like to talk about the German action. In December 2022, Germany began the first international purchase of hydrogen derivatives that must be produced outside the European Union with delivery starting in 2024. So this is already the beginning of an emerging international trade. When you talk about exporting the derivatives of green hydrogen, we are talking about green ammonia, right? Yes, right. Mainly green ammonia. There are others, but mainly green ammonia. Considering all the logistics costs, how the Brazilian market could have a pricing advantage comparing to its competitors, as you mentioned, North Africa and Middle East? Yes, good. Looking at the European market, Brazil has important competitors, as you said. However, two main competitive differentials. The first one refers to products commercialization with more added value that only hydrogen or even only ammonia, which takes advantage of other aspects in Brazil. So for example, this is the case of steel and even aluminum that we are an exporter and we have large mineral reserves that we use to produce and to export this kind of product. And also, for example, the fertilizer industry, where Russia was in the past a big global exporter and which, due to the war, is under embargoes, opening up space to be served for other countries. This opportunity, together with the interest of the market in a low carbon product, results in a possibility for Brazil to supply this market. And the second aspect refers to the large availability of natural resources to produce renewable electricity that we have here in Brazil. In addition, we already have established a production chain, mainly for wind generation, which contributes to reduction of production costs, mainly the electricity costs. And Brazil has historical characteristics of a clean electricity matrix. For example, in 2022, 92% of all electricity produced here in Brazil came from renewable sources, which is very difficult to achieve in a country as big as ours. It is this type of characteristics that we need to take advantage of in order to serve the international market with competitive costs. I see the discussions are addressing issues not only about the hydrogen production, but the whole supply chain of other goods. CCEE certification is a very interesting step for the sector, and Brazil's previous government was quite vocal about this subject, considering all the opportunities we could have. Now, we have President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva back in Brasília and Minister Marina Silva leading climate and other environmental issues. What can we expect from Lula's third term as president to promote green hydrogen? What is the political agenda right now? Gabriela, the expectation is that the hydrogen policy that's already in progress will be continued and even it will be accelerated. The expectation is because we are seeing in this beginning of the government a structure being built encouraging a sustainable economy. Over 2022, the government, with CCEE participation, created a plan to structure the National Hydrogen Program. This plan was published for public consultation at the end of the year, with the contribution period ending in February 2023. It was the period of all stakeholders could send a contribution. We hope that this process will be finalized and the plan will be put into practice with the sense of urgency that the market requires. With this step, we believe that Brazil can take advantage of this opportunity, the opportunity of a large national and international market, where the virtues of Brazil can contribute a lot to the global decarbonization. Okay, that's a very interesting topic for the Brazilian industry. Ricardo, thank you very much for joining us. Great. Thanks for the opportunity. It was a great pleasure talking to you, Gabriela.

Thank you for tuning in. I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, a senior reporter for Infralogic. Now we have a really great guest today, Ruben Munger. He is the founder of Vision Ridge Partners and also a managing partner at the firm, which he founded in 2008. Vision Ridge, which is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, focuses on renewable energy and other sustainability-linked investments. Ruben, thank you so much for joining us today. Thanks so much, Andrew. It's great to be here. So this is really an interesting time in the U.S. renewable energy sector. I've talked to Ruben somewhat frequently about the sector, and I can't wait to dive into this conversation. But before we do, can you give us, sir, can you give your audience a little bit of background about Vision Ridge Partners and where your focus is? Absolutely. Vision Ridge is a sustainable investment firm. We're focused predominantly on the impacts of climate change and finding ways to both mitigate and address that transition. We've been managing capital for institutional investors starting in 2014 in energy, transportation, and agriculture with a focus really on when and how this shift that's fundamentally happening to real assets and infrastructure is taking place. So to us, you can gain the same kind of principal protection as traditional real assets, but over time, all things in this category must become sustainable, and being at the vanguard of that transition means that you're able to earn really attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis. We raised a first fund in 2014 of just over $400 million, and at this point, managing excess of three billion in a private equity structure. We've found increasing scale and opportunity as the economics of the underlying areas that we invest in have consistently improved, and the world has been catching up with the importance of energy transition and how a lower-carbon economy can be more interesting, more valuable, less volatile, and achieve sort of better outcomes. And so we've been fortunate to grow across the last eight to 10 years and build a team that's quite experienced in our sectors and in our domains. So within the energy space, what sectors would you invest in? What sectors are you most focused on? Within energy, we've particularly been thinking about how traditional assets can support and accelerate the transition. So our recent investment in Earthrise Energy has purchased a series of natural gas beakers in the state of Illinois and expanding and using those to create a more renewable and lower-carbon production profile for customers. So as an example, at this moment in time, that business has 1.7 gigawatts of thermal assets, but has a one-and-a-half-gigawatt renewable development portfolio in that similar geographies. We're also pretty focused on how the power grid can support the emergence of electric vehicles, and so we have an investment in a company called Terawatt Infrastructure, and Terawatt is buying and developing the real estate that's necessary to support fleet electrification across the country. So in order to transition the distribution grid in such a way that you can support this significant increase in load, you need the right kind of technology and knowledge of infrastructure to build that and develop. And so those are examples of the kinds of transitions that we're particularly focused on within energy and power. All right, well, definitely a lot of interesting spaces that you guys are covering. Now, you started, you helped found this firm about 15 years ago. What was your background coming into this? So I was fortunate enough to be a partner at the BowPost Group. You know, that's a global value hedge fund that I joined when we had about $1 billion in assets, and by the time I left, the firm had grown to $12 billion. And so what we really focused on was how to understand and price risk and understand sort of a similar framework that we've carried through to Vision Ridge, which is on a risk-adjusted basis, if you're thoughtful and avoid loss of principle, over time, you can create real returns and value to investors. And so that kind of generalist, opportunist framework has been really helpful in bringing thoughtful structuring to what we do, where we work hard to find the right way to find an innovative management team and partner with them in a way that's a way for them to win and a way for us and our clients to win while creating really positive climate outcomes. And now, Ruben, what made you want to launch a new firm? What made you want to launch Vision Ridge rather than kind of either staying put or joining another established firm? So, you know, when we launched Vision Ridge, the idea of investing in sustainable real assets was a rather niche concept at best. And so even for our first fund, people felt like what we were doing must be concessionary. And our strong conviction was that it is actually the opposite, where being committed and to the learning and knowledge that's necessary to have confidence in making investments in this category gives you an opportunity to outperform and to lead the beginning of specialization. And that was really what drove me to start the firm. Ballpost is a fantastic platform, but this kind of work isn't what Ballpost is known for, we were a very opportunistic hedge fund, whereas to do the work that Vision Ridge does, you're often leaning in side by side with a management team, innovating around how a market is going to be structured. We used to own a company called Key Capture Energy, where we were building utility scale energy storage. And our projects were some of the first projects. And while we were able to mitigate risk with our EPC and by using certain batteries, there just weren't that many projects you could look to as this is how it's done. So we manage technical risk and technology risk and market risk, but at the end of the day, you just have to roll up your sleeves and do it side by side with your management teams. And that's really fun, exciting, and creates a great pie for everyone to split up over time. And that needed coming to the market with a specific dedicated firm who's really focused on this. We're not thinking about oil and gas in the background other than in how it impacts what we do, right? We're not a Johnny-come-lately to this topic. And so it's by being deeply embedded in it that we found the pathway to have the most value. Well, it's certainly been a very interesting and eventful 15 years for the renewable energy space, and perhaps even more so for the last six to eight months since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which really had a lot of incentives for renewable energy, a lot of incentives and initiatives that the renewable energy sector has been asking for, been seeking for a long time. And I think this year, we've talked a lot, for frequent listeners of this podcast, we've talked a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act since it passed. And I'm curious for your take, how big an impact is it having on the industry so far? How's it changing investing in renewables here what, six to eight months after its passage? You opened by talking about the change over 15 years, and I think one of the biggest points to make, first and foremost, is the old act that was previously the biggest thing that happened to renewables in 2008 was tiny relative and the costs of what things were was also much, much higher. So $1 of kind of subsidy and tax or otherwise out of the Inflation Reduction Act has five times as much leverage as what existed in the Recovery Act. And so this scope and scale of what's going on is truly unique. And we see it playing out in both sort of existing strong sectors and creating real acceleration in some of the more nascent ones. And so you can see activity in solar and wind is picking up a ton more attention in hydrogen and carbon capture, and then more velocity in electric vehicles, just using three different examples where they all had attractive subsidies attached to the IRA. And I guess I left out a fourth one where there's been a ton of activity in the domestic manufacturing sector. And that domestic activity is tied to both renewable power, so a lot of things around the solar supply chain, and then also electric vehicles and effectively the battery and mineral supply chain all the way through vehicle manufacturing. And so you've seen this comprehensive industrial policy come into play across the country, and you're seeing this mixture of announcements that have been truly remarkable. What's challenging is so much of it is still sitting in the announcement phase. And so people are making those risk decisions and capital decisions against a set of other things going on in the background. And so that acceleration of what's actually happening on the ground has a bit of a lag from a build that people weren't sure was gonna get done, right? The Build Back Better lived in limbo for a very, very long time, and the majority of people had sort of thrown in the towel on it until Senator Manchin, Senator Schumer, and the president came through with the Inflation Reduction Act. And so that really kick-started activities coupled with a series of other things changing, if you take, say, the solar supply chain where there's been a lot of disruption, first from COVID, then from tariffs, and other things such that there just was a challenge in getting that loosened up. And now, year on year, December volumes were up a third over the year before. And that's only gonna accelerate into these next couple of years as sort of these multiple pieces all unclog and people try to react to just giant amounts of opportunity, subsidy, and flexibility. And so some of the opportunity is also not just in the gross dollars, but it's in things like making tax credits transferable. And so it's simplifying the financial transactions and financial opportunities that were otherwise sort of a boon to the large banks, but were the bane of many project developers and ultimate capital owners' existence. And so the IRA was really thoughtful, and it also can't live independently, right? The CHIPS Act and the infrastructure bill also were very powerful. So if we live in, say, we have an electric school bus business, there is grant money flowing through the EPA from the infrastructure bill. There are then tax subsidies from the IRA, and you need to be thoughtful on how you can put those things together to deliver a better product to schoolchildren. You end up with a good financial proposition, you end up with a good clean air proposition, you end up with a good driver proposition where you have a quieter school bus. Putting those things all together is part of what's come through in the last 18 months of legislation. And now all of us are just scrambling to put in place the things to get it done. And it's really industry-wide. So in the first few months after the Inflation Reduction Act, it did seem like everybody was kind of going back to, going to their notebooks and making sense of everything in the act, how to best take advantage of it, and waiting for further legal guidance in some cases. We've definitely started to see deals, though, this year that are tapping into the act. For example, last month, we wrote about a battery storage deal that took advantage of the IRA's ITC for standalone battery storage. We are starting to see what are clearly IRA-inspired deals. I mean, to what degree do you think the act's force is being felt, and to what degree do you think the industry is still in this kind of making sense stage? I think the majority is still in the, they're out of making sense, they're just waiting for it to be clear enough to transact. The treasury guidance on various tax incentives remains important for things like community adders. You need to be sure you have them, and it's not worth transacting until you have a little bit more clarity so you can get paid full value for those if you're someone developing a project, as an example. There are a few of these things that are just waiting for a little bit more clarity, and over the next couple of months, I think the floodgates will really open up. That early energy storage ITC transaction got a jump on things, but the scope and scale of what can happen remains open in some areas. So I gave one example there. Transferability remains open for a little bit more clarification. You're looking at what is green hydrogen, what isn't green hydrogen, and some of those definitions are really important. And so people are building the projects and they're working their processes, but you're not gonna see transactions close until there's a tiny bit more clarity from the various agencies and other key actors to have that certainty that lets you commit capital. Well, that'll be interesting to see over the next several months how quickly the deals from this legislation are able to ramp up. Now, as you alluded to, it hasn't all been happy news for the renewable industry over certainly the past couple of years. Supply chain issues really came to the forefront in the industry, I'd say, in late 2021, but they still remain with us. They still remain an issue to a lot of the people I'm speaking to on a regular basis. On top of that, you have the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which is making it even tougher for certain developers to get the supplies they need. Some are getting held up in customs. Then you have the threat of tariffs on imports from several Southeast Asian companies. President Biden put a moratorium on that last year that runs through, I think, June of 2024. But as firms are planning ahead in their supply chains, that's still something I have to look at. How impactful have some of these headwinds been? And I mean, to what degree do you think the issue has been resolved, or is it still very much front of mind for anyone trying to put a project together? So I think the supply chain has been particularly challenging. The certainty of delivery has changed. The cost of delivery has changed. The lead time requirements have extended. And who a potential supplier can be has changed. Not to say that your list wasn't comprehensive, but there's also this transition towards an American-sourced supply chain. And so is it worth waiting for something that's bankable and manufactured here and getting the benefits of that when you think about those pieces? So for a developer, you're working through a set of choices around certainty, timing, cost, et cetera. And how do you layer in multiple pathways given some of those uncertainties? So you've seen a flight to a series of manufacturers where the phone is just ringing off the hook for them, while other manufacturers, I think, are pivoting and aren't gonna be suppliers into the United States, and they have to look to other parts of the global market. And I think it's important to note that solar panels are a global market. So not every country has the same restrictions that we do. But this transition of where can you source, what's bankable, how long do you want to risk something that is a little bit newer versus going to an old standby when a portion of those old standbys have fallen out of suppliers from whom you can purchase. And so it's just a massively more complicated piece coupled with an expansion of how much people are trying to build. And so you almost dovetail into a challenge from the capital side where timelines have extended, so you need to put deposits down sooner, and yet the capital availability for those deposits to secure modules, as an example, is more limited given just the scope and scale of how much is going on in the capital markets. And so that supply side of the conversation has been really taxing. I went to see the CEO of a relatively large renewable operator who also has a development portfolio. And historically, I think supply was something he probably spent three to 5% of his time on, and it did evolve to 50% of his time. And that's the kind of importance that it becomes where if you need to deliver a project, you need to make sure you can get all of your things. And some of those pieces are mitigating and getting clearer now, but it's been quite an issue. The other piece you didn't get into yet is around interest rates and cost of capital, and we can kind of keep going there, but that's the other big change over the last 18 months from where the industry was previously. Yeah, of course, and that's another good point, another topic that I do want to discuss. I mean, it seems like there's been a low interest rate environment prior to 18 months or so ago for a long time, probably, about as long as Vision Ridge since its founding. And now all of a sudden you see higher interest rates, you see rapid inflation, and a little bit less predictability around costs. How has that impacted the industry from your view? Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to date myself, but I do remember investing in a world with 5% treasury rates, and it is a different environment. And for this industry and the renewables industry, what you're really doing is you're making a significant capital commitment upfront, which is, in some ways, financing that capital is one of your largest costs. And what you don't have relative to traditional thermal power generation, as an example, is the same kind of input costs as you go. And so rising cost of capital means rising required cost of power, as well as just real changes on uncertainty. So you've had two different things happen. One, the base rate goes up, and then to the extent there's volatility in understanding where your cost of capital is gonna land, it's harder to have as much confidence on where a project's gonna pencil. And I think you have a whole world and a whole industry that isn't fully prepared to live in that framework where you have inflationary impacts on power prices. Power prices have been declining on the back of lower renewables for a long time. And so where is power gonna be is sort of more uncertain and dynamic than it had been. Where are your panel costs gonna be because of inflation? And then where is your financing gonna be? And you've now seen people have to think about or re-trade a PPA or say, look, this project's no longer viable. I thought I would be able to fund it with 3% or 4% debt, and now it's 6%, and the math no longer works. So those rising interest rates have sort of changed the fundamental LCOE of some of these projects and some of these opportunities, and it's mitigated a bit by the IRA and some increased subsidy, but it is a real challenge. And then that showed up pretty quickly into the system. What was a little bit slower is how a higher rate environment and tighter capital availability could manifest itself into this sector, where if you're looking across multiple sectors, venture capital lost access to the sort of loose capital environment first. And then growth equity lost access to that capital. And you saw growth stocks trade incredibly badly last year. Well, that capital availability and that higher kind of burden just on is there capital available was delayed into this sector as the sort of euphoria of the IRA passing had people pretty excited in the back half of last year. And we're starting to see now that there are so many interesting projects and so many opportunities, and while plenty of capital, there's not enough to address what needs to be done. And so people are increasing their required rates of return. And so deals that management teams thought were gonna price one way have come back around six to nine months later because the world wasn't there and they're much more willing to take a different return profile. So you're really seeing that shift in the market where there is capital scarcity and capital that's willing to invest and understand the challenges is very valuable. So it seems like the last few years, the conventional wisdom has been that there's a lot of capital chasing any project that's out there. There's a lot of new investors who want to get into the renewable sector in particular. And there's been a lot of infrastructure funds that have been raising capital like never before. And any desirable deal that came onto the market, you have a lot of firms chasing it. It sounds like that, like in your view, that's no longer the case. So as an investor, how do you adjust to that? And how do you find the right opportunity? I think that's a fascinating and important question. For us, we spent a lot of time looking for what can be a platform that an infrastructure investor is going to want to buy from us in a few years. So we do a lot of the hard work of going from one or two projects to build into a portfolio and building effectively that capital deployment engine that as people understand the category, they're then able to deploy $1 or $2 billion of construction capital into a known product while we've spent the years doing the first two to $400 million of capital into that platform. And so what we need to do then is look forward. And for us, two things have happened. One, I think the infrastructure, that sort of more core plus infrastructure investor is seeing more deal flow that they like. And so they had been reaching down into risks that they weren't necessarily certain they wanted to be taking. And now I think they have more of an opportunity to live in their more natural spot as a buyer of projects and really wait for things to be at the risk level that they prefer. And at the same time, venture capitalists have been coming in and funding development teams on the hope that they could bridge to that low cost infrastructure capital. And so for us, we like to sit in the middle of that and solve how you really create that business, whether it's electrifying school bus platforms or deploying utility scale batteries or putting together the right fleet real estate EV charging business or buying thermal assets and working to expand into an integrated IPP with renewables. Those niche sectors, I think, will become mainstream over time. And what we do is we just try to sit and look at an increasing universe of all the things that attach to the IRA, for example, that three to five years from now will be really at sort of recurring deployment. And so how do we back the right teams and build a set of assets that are not just operating assets that we've built, but then a pipeline from there that builds off of the expertise that we've built arm and arm with our management teams to really deliver the next leg for that infrastructure investor. So that's, to us, our niche has reopened a little bit where things were getting a little bit harder and now it feels much more like the 2012 to 2016 window where you really had more space to come to understand things and differentiate yourself with teams as the right person to partner with as they wanted to grow or transition their existence from a small scale opportunity to something that's really big and can be scaled countrywide or what have you. Well, it's interesting. Thank you for that, Ruben. And it's been a great discussion. It seems like we're all out of time, but thank you so much, Ruben, for joining us today. Andrew, it's always great to talk to you. I appreciate all your questions and interest. And thank you for tuning in to Crossroads, the infrastructure podcast.

I am your host, senior reporter for InfraLogic, Andrew Vitelli. Our guest today is Michael Tatarsky, a managing director for the renewables focused investment bank, Kohn Resnick Capital. Michael worked for financial firms, including Santander and Deutsche Bank before joining Kohn Resnick Capital in 2015. Michael, thank you for joining us today. Thanks for having me on, Andrew. Of course. So I think most of my listeners who do any work at all in the renewable energy space are very familiar with Kohn Resnick Capital. But for those who might not be, can you tell me a little bit about the firm? Sure. Kohn Resnick Capital is a renewable energy focused boutique investment bank. We focus broadly on sustainability and specifically on renewable energy. We've been at it for 10 years, getting our start in tax equity, placing and financing work, but have since evolved into a broader standard investment banking boutique offering focused on platform M&A, growth capital raises, asset sales, asset M&A, and then, of course, project finance, which includes tax equity, debt and any type of project level capital solutions needed. We've since, you know, done 265 transactions, over $40 billion in value. You know, happy to say we've probably, you know, reached the top of the league tables in deal volume for the last couple of years with, you know, over 20 or so transactions completed in 2022. Yeah. Whenever we publish our league tables, Kohn Resnick Capital is always at the top or towards the top in anything renewable energy related. Now you've been with Kohn Resnick Capital for seven years. Have you always been focused on the renewable energy space and what made you interested both in working on renewables and joining Kohn Resnick specifically? Yeah. You know, look, when I getting out of college, it was less, less of a focus. You know, I was hoping to just get a job and lucky to say I fell into renewable energy. You know, I've been doing this for over 10 years at this point and, you know, over seven, as you mentioned with Kohn Resnick Capital and it's been, it's been a lot of fun. You know, obviously the industry has grown significantly since we joining. We're doing larger deals, more deals, you know, finding interesting solutions for our clients, which has been really exciting to be a part of. And, you know, we think it's still kind of early innings in renewable energy and, you know, we're just happy to be part of the ride. Well, thank you, Michael. So we have a lot to talk about looking forward, but before we do, before we look towards the rest of 2023, I want to take a step back and look at what kind of a year 2022 was, because it was, I would say a very strange year for the renewable sector. Now entering the year and really through the first quarter, I would say that there were unprecedented headwinds running from supply chain challenges that we saw across industries that led to rising solar equipment prices. And then also specifically the threat of really heavy retroactive tariffs on most solar cell and module imports. I think it was the renewables industry seemed like it was in somewhat of a dark place in the beginning of 2022, but as the year moved on, we got first a two year freeze on the countervailing tariffs, which was a weight lifted for the industry. And then in August, President Biden signed the very poorly named inflation reduction act, which contained a lot of incentives that had long been on the renewable industries wishlist. So looking back at 2022, how would you summarize what that year brought to the sector? Yeah, no, look, I think you touched on a bunch of it, Andrew, right? So definitely a juxtaposition of a year. You know, the year started off with, with numerous headwinds, you know, some of which you listed inflation, supply chain challenges, you know, general financial market uncertainty, which created challenges across the renewable energy sphere, cost of capital rose it was tough to get equipment for many supplier for, for many developers ultimately delaying you know, construction windows and you know, the time it took to get projects completed. The cost of equipment went up significantly, even if you were able to get your hands on it including modules, turbines, interconnecting equipment. Some of that inflation has now leveled off from what we're seeing. There's been a steadying of PPA prices compared to, you know, call it second half of of 2022. But not, not withstanding, you know, supply chain issues, you know, continue to persist. I think it's interesting to see how some of the challenges with the ADCBD and the tariffs related to modules and imports from, from China work themselves out in 2023. That's one area that we're certainly continuing to watch and speaking with our sponsored developer clients something they're actively working through. There's been, of course, some clarity from from the government on, you know, which which type of equipment will be, you know, you know, continue to be challenged and which is okay to kind of proceed through customs. But all that, notwithstanding, it's created some challenges that we're continuing to work through. And then, you know, to continue, I think, you know, there were definitely benefits in the second half of 2022, you know, one of which is of course obvious, the passing of the inflation reduction act, which provided, you know, more than 350 billion of of stimulus into, you know, this renewable energy industry offering investors and sponsors alike, certainty and confidence around extension of tax credits. It opened up new markets for tax credits, including carbon capture, battery storage, you know, hydrogen, renewable, renewable natural gas, things like that. And then it also gave certainty around the existing tax credits, the PTC and the ITC for wind and solar, you know, kind of looking out into the next 10 years and allowing these developers the certainty to continue to develop and invest in this growth industry. And so I think the major theme of 2023 is going to be how the inflation reduction act is implemented and spurs the industry and starting, let's start with wind and solar with these existing technologies that were given certainty. Are you starting to see the effect of the IRA when it comes to deal flow and projects? I'd say there certainly has been a pickup on the one side of things, just given that the PTC has been extended and there's certainty around price of the PTC and the, the tenor going forward. The PTC now being offered for the, for the solar component as well, is certainly, you know, opening up markets and providing, you know, a more economic tax efficient solution in some markets, depending on geography, that capacity factor and costs of the system. Earlier this year, beginning or end of last year, we issued some analysis around that, which I think is important for developers to consider as they take projects through the development into construction and operation. What is the credit that provides the most economic solution? Is it the PTC or is it the ITC for solar? And that's, that's a very important question. And, you know, we're doing a lot of analysis for our clients on that. And it ultimately depends as mentioned on, you know, location and project specific capacity factors as well as cost to build. So in the, in the lower, in the lower states where, you know, it's cheaper to build with, you know, strong solar radiation, it is you know, it's more of a PTC play depending on the market. And then in areas where it's more expensive to build with lower capacity factors for those markets, you choose to go ITC. How healthy is the tax credit market heading into 2023 or now, now a month into 2023? Yeah, it's a good question, Andrew. I think we're still seeing the market trying to find some level of equilibrium on the supply demand side of the equation for both volume and price. Transferability of course has introduced a whole nother exit option, let's say for the tax equity market which is still, you know, subject to guidance and folks are trying to understand, you know, what that product is going to price at what the risk transfer is going to look like. How does it get documented? We're a part of many of those transactions currently, but many of them, you know, continue to be subject to guidance. So we expect to close our first one here in the next couple of months post guidance. But no, ultimately it's an interesting solution. We expect to see continued price discovery, growing liquidity in that market. It's necessary given the volume of credits that have been introduced as a result of the IRA. We'll touch on some of it, you know, kind of around carbon capture and battery storage, but also existing technologies in solar utility scale, community solar, DNI. The transferability option will be a good solution for many customers, for many sponsors, just depending on the size of the project and what kind of price ultimately gets offered. But we don't see it as a tool that's going to replace tax equity. In our analysis, traditional tax equity is still the economic solution. When compared to transferability, we expect that to persist. Just get tax equity market typically takes both the tax credits and a depreciation and a small share of cash. All in economics still result in a better solution for the traditional tax equity option. All that being said, transferability is going to provide a very good solution to many customers. And we think it's going to help grow this market more broadly. Well, that's good to hear. And it will be interesting to see how that plays out as we move forward in the year. We talked about wind and solar, and obviously these are technologies that were boosted by the IRA, but have been growing and, you know, can no longer really be considered nascent technologies. Where some expect the IRA to have an even bigger impact is in newer technologies that really haven't so much figured out their economics yet, specifically battery storage and carbon capture. Now, as long as I've been a reporter in the space, I've been hearing from investors and developers saying that the next big thing is going to be an ITC, an investment tax credit for standalone battery storage. Previously battery storage could only get the ITC benefit if it was charged by renewable resource a certain amount of the time, which made it, which made it really only tenable when it was a solar, solar plus storage project and not for a standalone storage. Now, finally, the industry has gotten that incentive. How big a boost is this going to have on battery storage, which we already saw heating up before the IRA was passed, even when it looked like it was, it might be dead. And how quickly will we see that ramp up take place? Sure. No. So we're involved both on carbon capture and energy storage across the firm. So we've been doing carbon capture for several years now, even prior to the passing of the IRA. So we're very, you know, well-versed and kind of in the weeds on carbon capture. Our expectation is that, you know, the IRA is only going to provide additional support to an industry that, you know, was economic prior, and it's going to allow more and more projects to become economic as a result. The, you know, the challenge with the carbon capture side of, of the technology sphere is that it's the projects are massive, right? So they demand a lot of tax credit off ramp, and that creates its own set of challenges because you need to find a home for all those credits either to transferability or traditional tax equity, both of which we're working on very closely in the carbon capture space. So it's a bit of a different problem. There's a lot of credits that need to, that need to be serviced for battery storage. Again, we're also very active in this and, you know, working with several key clients on energy storage transactions in tax equity and in M&A specific to the credits. You know, I think the projects that have some level of contracted offtake from credit worthy sources are naturally going to find a home in traditional tax equity for projects that are purely merchant arbitrage storage. Those are a bit more challenging whether, you know, the choice is to run them completely merchant. Chances are that those are going to go towards transferability as an option. And then they'll bring in, you know, external debt financing or other types of financing at the whole co-level in order to optimize the economics compared to, you know, contracted storage, which is going to kind of find a traditional tax equity solution as mentioned. The other thing is, you know, there are a lot of toll providers in the market still to be seen as to how that market develops and what the tolls look like, what the tenor is and the price and ultimately the credit backstop. Standing behind the obligations of the toll provider, assuming we find a solution there from some of the leading groups who are providing this type of product, I think that's going to, you know, create additional support and, you know, allow many of these merchant projects to go towards the traditional tax equity market and find a home. And do you think that it's going to take some time for developers and investors to figure all this out? Or do you think that that by the end of this year, we're going to start seeing a lot of these carbon capture projects, you know, being reaching financial close? Yeah, I expect to see, you know, completed projects this year in both carbon capture and battery storage. As mentioned, we're working on a handful, which, you know, we expect to reach completion here soon in terms of a financial close. And then, you know, in transferability generally post guidance, once that gets all finalized expectation is that we'll be able to see, you know, significant transfer deals get completed in the space. Okay, great. Well, thank you for that, Michael. And obviously we're going to see a lot of new development because of the IRA. What impact do you think it's going to have on the M&A market in 2023 and beyond? Yeah. So M&A has remained strong, you know, through kind of 2022 and into 2023, you know, despite inflation and rising cost of capital, M&A continues to be, you know, one of the bright spots in U.S. renewables. There's just this wall of foreign capital that, you know, continues to reinforce everybody's trying to find a platform to acquire everyone from, you know, foreign IPPs to infrastructure funds, but also domestic strategics and domestic infrafunds, private equity shops, hedge funds, pensions, other institutional type of investors. And, you know, in our view, that will only persist and continue with the support of the IRA. We've seen corporate M&A take priority for many investors over, you know, asset and portfolio M&A, just given that developers and sponsors have made a cognizant decision to keep projects on balance sheet, hold onto them longer, take them through, you know, construction and into operation, essentially transitioning existing business models from dev flip into own operate. And that's, you know, boosted platform values. And it's been a, you know, a success story, let's say, for many groups that have pivoted business model and, you know, seek exit from, from the investor market. So in our view, you know, M&A asset activity will continue both in traditional renewables, call it, you know, solar and wind, but also in energy storage. We saw 20 in 2021, we saw 15 M&A transactions in energy storage in 2022 23 energy storage transactions. And our expectation is that, you know, that's only going to grow in the coming years. Well, Michael, you brought up the platform transactions that we've seen. And that is one of the major trends that, that we saw in 2022 and, and even prior where there were a lot of these renewables platforms where an investor would pay sometimes a hefty price for a platform that had a lot of early stage projects and a very ambitious pipeline. And then, you know, in most of these cases, a really strong team, a team of experienced people in the sector, but not a lot, but had not developed a lot, didn't have a lot of projects that were far along and investors were kind of paying for the prospect of developing out this early stage pipeline. You know, I'm wondering if you think there are too many of these platforms or two, you know, that have too much ambition. And it's going to be something that a lot of these, a lot of these deals end up being more challenging than, than maybe investors expect. Yeah. I, you know, I'd say that there perhaps may have been, observed the flight to quality where started to focus on, you know, the best in class management teams. So, you know, there's certainly some of that. And I think it was driven by, you know, many of the macro factors that we touched on at the top of the podcast. But you know, what I'd say is in 2022, you know, deals got done. There was a lot of majority platform M&A. We tracked 13 deals completed in 2022 and 32 minority platform M&A deals. So it's a strong number, you know, and I think that with some of the macro headwinds stabilizing in 23, you know, we may see continued growth in this space. I think one challenge is, you know, it's to be seen as to, you know, what happens with inflation, do we face a recession 23 or beyond and how that kind of flows through into the investor market cost of capital, you know, and of course the resulting valuations of the platforms. But as mentioned, you know, this wall of capital, this demand for ESG investment is persisting. It's very strong. Everybody's trying to find a way to, you know, step into a platform that has the expertise in this space that knows how to develop these projects, that knows how to put projects into operation. And many investors have made a decision where instead of buying single assets and going through these long processes to, you know, acquire single, single projects, we're going to buy a management team that has the expertise, you know, that's vertically integrated, that has the technical, you know, know-how internally to continue to, you know, originate pipeline and grow the business as the market expands. Well, thank you for that, Michael. Now we're running out of time, but we opened this conversation talking about some of the headwinds facing the industry in 2022. And a lot of those did kind of work themselves out, but not completely. For one, we talked about the threat of countervailing tariffs. And although there is that freeze, which will run until June of next year, the industry is still facing the realistic prospect that imports from Southeast Asia could face those tariffs when that moratorium expires. And perhaps the bigger issue now facing the industry when it comes to supply chains is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and which is an effort to make sure that imports into the United States are not benefiting from forced labor in China. And earlier this year, we were seeing a lot of solar imports being seized by customs before making it to the U.S. Now we've seen a little bit of a let up in that. And some folks are optimistic that it could work itself out, but that's another challenge facing the industry, along with continued inflation, along with rising interest rates and continuing supply chain challenges. How serious are these headwinds remaining? And I mean, do they threaten to hold up the progress that the IRA seeks to promise? Yeah. I mean, I'd say so, Andrew, right? So I think those are real challenges that the industry is working through. Many people are working through it. I believe we're going to find a way, you know, do we hit kind of the hockey stick growth that, you know, has been advertised as part of the IRA passing that may be difficult, but, you know, this industry historically has gone through a lot of ups and downs, starts and stops. And, you know, I think we might see some of that continue as a result of general macro conditions. We've seen some easing of the, you know, tariff and, you know, the imports of, of major equipment from Asia. There's been clarity and guidance from, from the government on that. You know, supply chains, domestic supply chains are, you know, starting to develop, which is going to provide some some support in the future, but it will take time for those supply chains to fully form. And that, you know, those OEMs to start producing more and more equipment domestically, all that to say, I think we're likely to see, you know, many of those things continue to create, create headwinds in 2023 and beyond, but I'm certain that, you know, we will continue to kind of do our job and sponsors will continue to develop projects and we'll, we'll find a path. Well, thank you for that, Michael. And a lot more we could cover. We could talk all day, but I think we're just about out of time. So Michael, thank you so much for, for joining me today. Thanks for your time. And thank you to our listening audience for tuning into Crossroads.

I'm joined today by S&P's Giuliana Iocotta, who is going to talk to us about the impacts of inflation on infrastructure concessions, particularly in the transportation sector, as well as utilities and other areas. Hi, Giuliana. Thanks for joining us today. Hello, Jonathan. Thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to speak here. Giuliana, inflation has been a really important word in 2022. President Joe Biden at one point complained that nobody knew what inflation was and they were using it as a stick to beat him. But I think by now we've all learned a lot about inflation and how it's affected our lives. In the infrastructure sector, I've spoken to a lot of people who said that inflation has really affected how people are pricing projects and how people are planning for infrastructure concessions. Could you talk a little bit about the state of inflation in the last year and how it's affected the situation in Latin America? Jonathan, the official inflation for 2022 was not published yet for the countries as we are just starting 2023. But our estimate for 2022 is a 10 percent weighted average for the six largest economies with 10.5 percent for Brazil, 11.5 percent for Chile, 10 percent for Colombia and around 8 percent for both Mexico and Peru. This was mainly driven by food and energy goods and inflation peaked in the first and second quarter of last year, depending on the country. And of course, Argentina is the outlier with over 70 percent inflation in 2022. So for this year, we forecast around 40 to 50 percent lower inflation for each of the countries. The central banks for these countries started earlier the monetary tightening by the third quarter of 2021 to restrain the inflation hike. So it should be a little bit lower than you see in the U.S. and Europe for 2023. Juliana, in your report, you state that toll roads and mass transit systems have been worse affected by rising inflation than utilities, airports and ports. Could you explain why that is? So infrastructure concessions contracts are typically adjusted by inflation given its long term nature. But at the same time, the negative pressure comes from the affordability concerns, which is particularly sensitive to low income customers in Latin. So we have seen governments to prepare contra cyclical measures in advance for utilities as impacts at the general population. For example, we have seen subsidies for low income customers programs in Brazil and the same government has already created three programs to absorb the impact of higher energy price due to the drought and the pandemic is moving the effect of the potential hike in the energy bill to the end consumers. So similarly, Chile has created the PEC one, freezing the energy tariff for a period after the 2019 riots. And more recently, the PEC two to absorb this recent spot price hike. In Mexico, the government which owns CFE has been absorbing part of the fuel cost, not passing through, you know, this spike to the end consumers. And in Argentina, only discretionary energy adjustments have been done in the past years. So for airports, volumes are more related to the disposable income trend and the airline ticket price as the airline or the airport fee only represents a small portion of the ladder. And for ports, the tariff fluctuates with the demand factors as port operators tend to provide discounts to the shipping lines when they are facing idle capacity. That's why we highlighted that the toll roads are more exposed to affordability concerns because the contracts have been adjusted as expected by the inflation and the region as well has been exposed to riots against tariffs increases. And as I understand it from some of my reading elsewhere, in terms of toll road concessionaires, one of the big problems is the subcontractors in projects, obviously, as you mentioned, the toll road concessions themselves have inflation linked clauses to adapt some of the costs, but when the construction costs are increasing so much, and as well, internationally, the prices of resources and materials and equipment are increasing as well. A lot of that is passed on through the subcontracting, isn't it? It's true. And it is something that might squeeze the operating margins of these operators. In your report, you also mentioned the protests and you mentioned them just now as well. A lot of those have targeted the toll stations in Latin America in recent years. We saw that in Chile, we saw that somewhat in Colombia and also in Brazil. What does this tell us about the risks that toll road operators assume? And how are the government's structuring projects and intervening to mitigate against issues like inflation when tensions rise in this way? So John, this is something very unique for Latin, right? That different than the US and Europe, the roads are still the main transportation mean for the goods in the region. So there is still attractiveness for the operators for this type of assets in the region. At the same time, the potential risk of government intervention on tariffs is real, as we have seen. It is reflected in our rating analysis as we cap the rating of these entities to the one of the respective sovereign. That being said, there is also positive track record of compensation either by economic rebalance, such as a concession extension or a financial, as it has recently happened to the toll roads concessions in the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. It's important to note that we did not experience any break of contractual terms in the region. And then what is S&P's outlook for Latin American toll road concessionaires in 2023? We've seen somewhat of a rebound since COVID. And I believe you were saying that there's been a kind of a cutoff point for S&P in terms of how you qualify the kind of pre-COVID and post-COVID situation. Could you explain to our listeners a little bit about that, about the kind of break with 2019, 2020 in terms of your analyses? So it's important to note that most of the portfolio has already recovered for the toll roads to the pre-pandemic levels, as transport of the goods remains essential to the general population. We, going forward, should forecast a one and a half, two times elasticity to each of the country's GDP for the traffic growth, considering that we, S&P, as a rating agency, tend to be more conservative than the companies when we forecast the traffic. So that should be the new baseline going forward. In your report, you also discuss how ports and airports will be sensitive to general economic activity, as many are predicting a worldwide recession in 2023. Do you explain how project revenues might fare at these facilities during the coming year? OK. For ports, even during the peak of the pandemic, volumes were only down by 5 to 10 percent. So even if we see a recession, global trade should continue to sustain revenues of ports. It might be a flat growth to some of the ports, but we have to consider that the region, Latin America in general, exports agricultural and proteins that tend to be less impacted and benefit by the currency devaluation in the region. The economic deceleration might impact the volumes of imports, giving a lower capital spending, estimatives and investments. This is somewhat the factor that we'll be monitoring for the ports. And if you think about lower disposable income, this might affect volumes for air travel, given that the traffic recovery was boosted by leisure, friends and family travelers, as business travel recovery continues to be uncertain at this point. But it's still too soon to see like a big hit, as we have seen pent up demand yet to be satisfied, both in the last summer and in the year end period. Also in the report, you did mention utility companies as well. Could you talk about how some of the rate setting mechanisms there are granting a full pass through of inflation? As I said before, in Brazil, we have a full pass through of the costs. The drought has been smoothed by, you know, these programs. In Chile, they just have created the PEC2 that will soften the impact of the higher energy bill that the country experienced due to the drought and due to the higher oil price. In Mexico, there were no full pass through of all the fuel price to the energy bill. CFE has been absorbing, you know, part of the energy, the contracted energy price with the suppliers. And in the case of Argentina, this is very discretionary. So there were no pass through of whatsoever of the energy price. Okay. So Juliana, please tell us a little bit about how the companies, the S&P rates are tackling this situation regarding inflation. What are they doing regarding their cash flows or their cash positions to confront the situation? So, John, since the pandemic started, most of these infrastructure companies in the region, they have prolonged their capital expenditures plan, meaning that they're saving some of the larger investments that we're planning to do in the period for like pushing a little bit further. And we do expect that to continue to happen, given the current situation. They have also managed to secure long term financing at lower rates when we had the scenario back in 2021-2022. So we don't expect them to suffer neither by big short term maturities, neither by the hike on inflation linked debt, right, as they have managed to secure fixed financing in the past period. Okay. So with that in mind, do you anticipate that there's going to be much potential for refinancings in 2023? Or do you think most of the companies have now locked in decent long term rates from 2021-2022? We didn't see many refinancing or new issuances in 2022, as they have managed to secure before that. And we don't expect it to happen like a big liability management in 2023, as they don't have big short term debt maturities. And with the increasing interest rates globally, we wouldn't expect to happen this year neither. Okay, excellent. Giuliana, that's a really interesting discussion on inflation. It's obviously a very important issue for infrastructure concessionaires at this time. So I'm sure our readers would be really interested to hear these comments. Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you. That's all we have time for today on our Crossroads podcast.

For today's episode, we have a guest, Alan Cooper from ON Energy. Alan is the CEO of ON Energy, and he's going to talk to us today about batteries and energy storage as part of the energy transition in Latin America. So welcome to the podcast, Alan. Afternoon, Jonathan. Thanks for the invitation. Alan, we had the pleasure recently of welcoming you to our InfraLogic Investors Forum in Miami at the end of November. I really appreciated your participation there, where you shared a little bit about ON Energy, some of the work that you're doing in developing battery storage systems in Latin America. So for our guests, could you start today with a brief description of who are ON Energy, and what are you looking to do in the space in Latin America? So ON Energy is a technology company and project developer focused almost exclusively on energy storage. We have developed an end-to-end solution for energy storage, which takes things all the way through from understanding how battery storage can add value in different power markets, taking that all the way through development, engineering, fully PC implementation, commissioning, and eventually long-term O&M. That also includes, most recently, a project finance facility, which allows us to put projects on balance sheet and work with financial partners to structure storage and service agreements across the region. We operate today with a team of 75 people across four core markets, primarily focused in Latin America and North America, in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Peru, with our office and physical infrastructure. ON Energy utilizes its proprietary software across the development and operations of energy storage systems. We have development software, which allows us to accurately optimize and forecast what battery storage is going to do in the field relative to real-world applications and our own dispatch algorithms. That basically provides greater security for our customers in being able to underwrite the risk of battery storage and being able to underwrite that revenue stream. Finally, we also use our sort of crown jewel, which we call OnCommand, which is our energy management system, to physically control and dispatch all of our 52-plus energy storage systems, which are currently operational. That is a totally flexible and proprietary platform, which allows us to integrate different hardware vendors, different technologies, different chemistries, and being able to generate a full turnkey solution to customers that makes it easy to contract and procure storage in a market that historically hasn't had access to it. Okay, excellent. Alan, tell us a little bit more about the genesis of ON Energy. I understand that you've been working in the energy business across Latin America and North America for about 15 years. Tell us about your experience starting ON Energy. What were the driving factors that led you and your partners to form this company? It's a great question. I think ours is truly an energy transition story. I studied environmental economics at the University of Toronto, really passionate about a potential transformation of energy, which wasn't quite ready at that time. I worked on one of the first projects that implemented full EV vehicles in North America, and it was a fleet vehicle project operated from the city of Toronto. Within that, I had to do battery analysis. And frankly, the results of that battery analysis and chemistry analysis were not very good at that time, both from a recycling cost and even consumer and driver behavior. It was all fairly poor. This was in 2007, approximately. I later shifted into a more conventional energy background, and I started several energy technology companies alongside partners and my family in order to basically develop technology and bring it to Latin America, primarily Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and a few other markets across the region. Those businesses continue to operate today. But in about 2016, I saw a window where fundamentally the cost of battery modules had declined to a level where they were nearly in the money and where power prices, particularly demand charges, were sufficiently high to have a nominal payback on some of these solutions. And that's when I decided to step into the energy storage market, a little bit inspired by what some of the companies were doing in California, companies like STEM and Green Charge Networks. And we decided to attack markets which were largely underserved in Latin America. And that's how we selected both Peru and Mexico with very high demand charges, focused on commercial industrial applications. I also tied up with my co-founder, Ricardo Dezaveto, who's a brilliant engineer. And he actually brings together three key disciplines, which are basically electrical engineering, and so the electromechanical functioning of energy storage assets in the field. And he's also a computer scientist and a data nerd. And so bringing together all these things allowed us to create and leverage some technology, which I had actually built for oil and gas, and create what is on command, which is our energy management system, which actually controls and dispatches the energy in a way that optimizes energy consumption and pricing for customers. And that may be utilities, and in many cases, that's commercial industrial customers, where we're basically providing some level of energy efficiency mechanism and resiliency mechanism behind the meter. Fantastic. And in terms of the market itself, I think when we've spoken, we've said that here at Infralogic, we haven't seen a large amount of utility scale project finance battery storage systems or portfolios of battery storage systems in Latin America. Few of the new renewable generation projects in places like Colombia and Mexico have started to incorporate that technology. I believe in Chile as well, they're using some of this technology. But talk to us about how the market's been evolving in recent years. You said you started around 2016. Here we are six years later. You recently announced a project where you were going to install battery systems at several major airports across Latin America. Tell us about how On Energy has found the market evolving and how you found your space within that market. It's an interesting question, Jonathan. I think there's almost like a phase change every two years or so, at least in the Latin America market. Really, it was in its inception when we first got started. We actually deployed the first battery storage solutions in both Peru and in Mexico, and we did those. That was 2017 and late 2018, respectively. From 2016 to 2018, it was largely a piloting phase. So it was really educating customers and trying to get both regulators and customers comfortable around the technology. We've had the advantage in Latin America to have some thought leadership and some pretty advanced regulation in some North American markets like Kaiso and PJM. However, it takes a while for them to get comfortable around it. From 2018 to 2020, it was really an early commercial year, certainly for On Energy and I think for the industry as a whole. Here was basically when first customers started really signing up and storage and service structures started to develop. When we were able to do it in late 2020, we struck a partnership, a joint development agreement with NLX to have NL own and operate batteries that we would develop and build for them and for large CNI customers in that market. Then from 2020 to 2022 has really been about product market sit and having a lot of these customers come back and repeat and expand on deployment schedules, have some copycatting from key competitors of theirs and trying to implement similar solutions to the ones that they see other CNI customers developing and a lot of utilities now really getting a lot more comfortable around hybridizing their facilities with battery storage to make them as efficient as possible, primarily with primary frequency regulation. What I see into the future, I guess in the next two-year phase change is really scale. You mentioned the airport projects, which was an interesting batch of work that we had during 2022. I mean, into the future, I expect this to scale really broadly. That was a 39-megawatt-hour project, which deployed across 11 international airports, which came on the tails of having deployed solutions at each of those airports earlier in 2011 and early 2022. I think this industry is still nascent in Latin America. I think there's a ton of opportunities certainly here. I think one of the key opportunities is with power quality and the requirements for additional power quality, specifically in the manufacturing sector. I think that's what 2022 and 2024 are going to bring for OnEnergy and for the industry as a whole. In terms of the opportunities in the market, we mentioned the airports, obviously, and some of the utility companies that you've been working with, your partnership with NLX to develop these systems. Where are you seeing future opportunities as the market expands and the projects grow? Do you think there are other particular industries or particular sectors of the economy which will require these projects that you'll be looking to deploy? In all of Latin America, I think we're lucky enough to have national grid codes for the most part, and those cover the majority of the country. Really, the applications vary whether you're talking behind the meter or in front of the meter. I see an increase certainly in front of the meter of existing generation trying to hybridize their fleets with energy storage, as I mentioned earlier, but also for renewables to start integrating storage really at scale with their renewable developments. We've seen some flourish of activity in Chile, in Colombia, and recent announcements in a couple of markets in Central America as well. There are a couple of markets which are still lagging behind from a regulatory standpoint. I think that might be an obstacle across the markets, but really, where I see a lot of growth also coming in Latin America is behind the meter. I think that behind the meter batteries basically target three things, Jonathan. They target what we call the three S's. They target savings, sustainability, and energy security. Really, these are three things that are paramount to commercial industrial customers in our region, typically operating on fairly poor power grids with high energy prices and with really a need to show customers and consumers that they're doing something for the environment. I think that battery storage presents itself as a compact, low friction from a regulatory perspective solution that they can implement really rather quickly. Let's call it six to 12-month deployment time. I think that's what's been so attractive to our customers where we have the pride to service today and why I think so many more people are going to be signing up in the next couple of years as well. Tell us a little bit for the benefit of our listeners who are primarily bankers, investors, and advisors working on the financing of such projects in this space. How have you been financing the business and the specific projects individually? Do you think that in the wider battery storage space that there's opportunities for using long-term project-backed, non-recourse finance to support these projects? That's also been something that's been changing fairly rapidly in the region. When we got started, we got laughed out of the room several times. We brought systems that required any sort of long-term service agreement or financing associated to them. In more recent years, I think there's been an influx of interest in the space. Not a lot of people have actually gotten projects across the line. We're one of the few groups that actually has. I think the key basically in Latin America is to follow the cardinal rules of structured finance and project finance in Latin America, which is you need creditworthy offtakers. You need a sufficient time period to cover the cost of the equipment plus the return on capital. You need some level of take or pay or predictability of revenue streams, which isolates the companies from really merchant and regulatory risk. I think those are the structures that we've managed to put in place. What we do is we can offer customers an incentive by taking more of the performance risk on the battery storage side. We're able to do that through our proprietary technology and our integrated service provision business model. I think that's what's led us to be successful so far. Otherwise, really, this is more of a lease model, which can work. In Latin America, largely, we're competing against international and multinational corporations with very large balance sheets and the ability to borrow money at lower capital costs than lenders are willing to lend for this type of project. What that's led is a little bit of a catch-22 that the customers who want financing, you don't really want to finance, and those who you do want to finance don't really need your money because they have cheaper money on the street. So that's been one of the challenges to actually scaling in the project finance side. I think one of the things that I would change is I think we need greater acceptance of potentially local currency and being able to match the project finance and the revenues to local currency for some sort of hedge. Certainly, we're making progress on that in markets like Mexico and even in Peru. I think that we need to structure these things with maybe more stringent performance guarantees and have some level of diligence around what a bankable solution actually looks like. I think there's a lot of people deploying solutions that likely aren't bankable in the region yet. And I think that when the dust settles, the bankable solutions will stand and will rise to the top. And I feel that as further interest comes in the region and scale comes to the region, that's going to be another key. Right now, projects are between, I don't know, per install, probably between 1 and 10 megawatts. And from a structured finance standpoint, as you know, Jonathan, and some of your listeners I'm sure know, it's just not enough to really make it juicy for financiers to structure deals around. Then it becomes a matter of aggregation and being able to deploy all those things at one time, which is also complex from a commercial standpoint. So I think there's still a lot to learn on the structured finance side, but certainly I think it would unlock a ton of value for end customers, which is the most interesting for me, and certainly for financiers to get above market returns, likely in the low teens to deploy solutions, which frankly have provided amazing results. And I think we'll continue to have further potential into the future. Alan, historically OnEnergy has had more of an ownership and sale model for the systems that you've developed, as I understand it. Is the company looking to perhaps go beyond operation and maintenance and the software provision for some of these projects and enter into any kind of asset management strategy? Does the company have the capital for that kind of plan? Yeah, Jonathan, I think that's one of the key transformations over this next year to 18 months for OnEnergy. We recently closed on our first institutional capital raise with a company called SDCL, the London-based energy efficiency trust, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, and they provide basically a project finance capability that we previously haven't had access to. So in those cases, we act as asset manager alongside a low cost of capital financier. I think that's been very attractive for a lot of our customers in North America, in particular, where this has really reached maturity and scale. We have an interesting project set of both behind the meter and in front of the meter developments in North America, both in Canada and the US, which I think provide a ton of potential for the company and a transformation towards more of a light IPP strategy. And I think that this next year is critical to us being able to prove that out. The pipeline is there. We have the experience and know-how in actually deploying over 100 megawatt hours of these solutions over 52 sites and 30 plus customers on the top tier, both utility and commercial industrial customers, where, frankly, we can build these for ourselves and for financial partners and operate on the grid from a trading perspective, which we also have the software capabilities on a proven basis. So I think this is certainly one of the directions that the company is moving in. We still love working with third party developers. We work with large solar CNI platforms. They're looking to integrate storage into their portfolios, and we can provide them with our technology and our solutions sort of as more of a service provider. But when I look into the future, I think we have access to some very interesting value created projects where we can deploy capital at scale and deploy our technology at scale, and both those things will be positive for the organization. And that's a great way to kind of round things up in terms of the future, Alan. What do you think the scope, both geographically and kind of size wise, looks like for the expansion of On Energy's business in the region? We can already see that. If I look across my pipeline, we have a pipeline of almost five gigawatt hours of energy storage across seven different countries. Over half of that right now is in North America, which is a market that is somewhat new to us. We've been in the market for about 12 to 18 months now. But certainly the opportunity is going to be very large here in North America, where I'm sitting in our headquarters in Miami, Florida. We see tons of opportunity across ERCOT. There's opportunities in eastern Canada. There's opportunities in Virginia, and I believe that Latin America will continue to be a solid base for the company from a deployment perspective, from a customer-based perspective. And I think that between the both of those things, we'll be able to build truly an America's platform for energy storage and try to bring our know-how to customers in favor of the energy transition, which is near and dear to the hearts of everybody within the organization and something we're truly passionate about. And we're just trying to deploy as much storage as possible to move us in that direction. Alan, thank you so much for sharing this today. It's been really interesting to listen to you talk about the business and about the prospects for energy storage in Latin America and here elsewhere in North America, too. We'd like to say thank you very much on behalf of Infralogic and our listeners for joining the podcast today. And we'll be tracking your progress very closely over the years, and we wish you all the best. True pleasure, Jonathan. Thanks very much. Thank you.

I am your host, Andrew Vitelli. Thank you for tuning in. My guest today is Andrew Warren. She was a 25 year veteran of the power markets industry and the founder and CEO of renewable developer Spearmint Energy. Andrew, thank you for coming on to our show. Thank you for having me. Well, Andrew, to get started, why don't you tell me a little bit about your background in the power industry? Sure. So I'm just celebrating my 25th year in the power space. During that time, I've worked for a couple of different utilities, as well as financial institutions. I've owned and operated some assets, and I also ran a hedge fund for a while that used a fundamental, what they call a stack model for forecasting prices throughout the grid. Well, thank you for that introduction. In April, you launched Spearmint Energy. Now, tell me a little bit about Spearmint and why you thought this was a good time. And keep in mind, April was before the Inflation Reduction Act had passed. But why did you think this was the right time to launch a company focused on battery storage? So I've been aware of battery storage for many years, and in my models, the cost was always prohibitively high, and the revenues earned by batteries was insufficient to cover that cost. And I think that myself and most people in the industry sort of lost track of batteries until about 2018 or 2019. And I realized that the price of batteries had dropped 90% in 10 years and 50% in five years. But not only that, the revenues available to batteries in various markets like ERCOT and CalISO, all of a sudden, the revenues were high enough and the costs were low enough that the widespread adoption of lithium-based battery energy storage made a lot of sense. And so as a trader, I look at batteries like a warehouse. And if you think about commodity trading in general, you have someone somewhere who's producing a product, whether it's oil, gold, copper, or power, someone who transmits it or moves it like a ship, and then a warehouse which stores it, and then another transportation arm that sells it to end-use customers. And from giving the history of power for 25 years, I would always say power is different because it can't be stored. But this changes everything because now power can be stored. And so all of the financial models, all the option theories are turned on its head. And so now a battery can act like a warehouse, whether for a one minute or one day or even a week, and store power and use it when it's most needed. And so that, to me, was the right time to get into the market. So you talk about the cost declines, which we had seen by 2018, as you mentioned. But at least pre-Inflation Reduction Act, financing batteries had always been something of a challenge. How are you approaching this, and how does it differ from others in the industry? So when I first started looking at these batteries in early 2020, the feedback we got from private equity firms and lenders was that in order to get the battery financed, you needed a utility offtake contract of 100% with a long duration. And then, only then, would you get buy-in from equity and debt to do the project. Now we're in a world where we're seeing lenders willing to lend against merchant storage, and equity investors willing to invest in merchant storage. And that's a whole new world, right? We believe that the optimal structure for a battery is to have a partial long-term toll, and that's part of what we do at Spearman, is provide long-term tolls to batteries, whether they're our own development projects or otherwise. And so what we've seen over the last couple of months since the IRA was passed is, I want to say, a three or four-fold interest in our tolling business. And maybe it's a good time to step back. We at Spearman, we do really three things, right? We develop or acquire and develop and complete large-scale battery energy storage facilities. We have a separate arm that owns them. And then we have a third group which operates and trades around them. And that trading group, really their main goal is to provide a risk transfer from the infrastructure asset owner to a trading entity that can better deal with swings up and down in the market revenues. Most of the infrastructure investors we speak to, they want long-term stable cash flows, maybe a little bit of upside if the market goes up. But they're really doing this to almost act like a real estate investor, where they'll buy something with a long-term lease in place, and then maybe take a little bit of recontracting risk along the way. And you mentioned the long-term toll. I mean, some of our listeners might not be familiar with that. Can you explain that a little bit? Sure. Barring a concept from other parts of the commodity trading world, the long-term toll is essentially a rental or a financial lease, or sometimes a physical lease, where the trading firm acquires all the rights to use and operate the facility. It's very common in the combined cycle power world to do long-term heat rate call options or tolling agreements. You have the same sort of thing in natural gas storage facilities, or even grain silos, right? And in many ways, I will argue that a battery is very similar to a grain silo or a natural gas storage facility, the one difference being that you can empty it, fill it, and empty it again in one day, sometimes in less than a day. All right. Well, thank you for that. Now, you launched Spearmint in April, officially, and at that time, it seemed like the Build Back Better plan was DOA. It seems like there wasn't going to be, at least in the immediate term, any federal help for battery storage. And I know that that's something that the industry has wanted for a long time, is an investment tax credit similar to what they have for solar, have wanted that for standalone storage. It was something that the industry was expecting when President Biden took office, and those prospects had significantly dimmed by the time your company was launched. Now, in August, that turned around, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a significant financial incentive for battery storage, was signed. How big a game changer was that, both for your firm and for the industry? Well, I think I have two ways of answering that. One, I'll say it was a gift too early because we had really hoped on getting our pipeline expanded pretty substantially before any federal policy came in place, but we love it. I mean, prior to the IRA passing, I would say that storage was economic in three or four states. But since then, I can make an argument that almost all lower 48 states, battery energy storage is now economic, either today or at some point in the foreseeable future. And what I mean by that is if you build a battery today in an area where there's not a lot of price volatility and not a lot of renewables, then you probably wouldn't want the battery online tomorrow. But looking forward to what's coming with solar and wind, both onshore and offshore, you know that there's going to be a huge need for batteries, sometimes two, three, four, five years down the road. What's been critically apparent over the last decade or two in the renewables industry was that too much solar or too much wind causes lots and lots of problems for the grid in the short term. Batteries solve that. Batteries are all about efficiency. It's very hard for anyone to argue against something that makes the market more efficient. But having the ability to store power really reduces the ultra low prices and ultra high prices. Historically, you know, you've seen power in many cases go negative in price, and you've also seen lots of short term shortages where prices go into the thousands of dollars. Storage helps reduce that. But further, and this is the key thing, it helps provide ancillary services, right? That's sort of like, for those that don't know, an option to provide power on an ultra short term basis if the grid or the ISO needs it. And what that does is it relieves thermal units of that obligation. Batteries actually reduce carbon emissions much more than on their face, because they actually eliminate the need for a lot of ancillary services to be produced by simple cycle gas peakers, aeroderivatives and such. And so we think that, one, they're incredibly efficient. Two, they significantly reduce the carbon emissions related to providing ancillary services. And third and most important, they allow a multiple on the cost of installed batteries or megawatts installed of additional solar and wind to hit the grid. You can't add more solar and wind without batteries. They are the missing link. And so you have a massive amount of equity capital and a massive amount of debt capital who all want to play in the battery energy storage space. The problem in this sector today is that there's almost no one out there who can provide a long term offtake or rental or toll. Yes, the utilities can provide some of it. But if you've ever been involved in a utility offtake procedure, it can take six months to 12 months. It's a competitive process. You spend a lot of time and you might lose. And there's certainly not enough equity capital out there to have all the batteries go merchant. So we think that we're the first of what will likely be a very large number of financial firms playing in the battery offtake space. It's good for the environment. It's good for carbon. And it's also profitable at the same time. So you talk about these ancillary services provided by the batteries. Now, I know that in the past, it's been difficult for battery developers to figure out exactly how to monetize them and how to use that to get financing. Does the IRA solve these issues or are there still a lot of questions that remain to be to be answered? Well, when it comes to ancillaries, they're far more complicated of a product than most people realize, but they do represent today upwards of 50 percent of the revenue available for batteries. Now, that'll quickly decrease as you have more and more batteries installed. They'll sort of cannibalize each other and eat all the revenue. But at least now and for the next two or three years, it provides a massive new revenue opportunity. Now, that doesn't really have much to do with the IRA, right? It's more ISO policies. ERCOT, the Electric Liability Council of Texas, which runs the Texas power market, recently passed a new rule allowing batteries preferred access to the ancillary service market. That's the ECRS program. And that allows a very small change in the rules to help batteries earn more revenue than other units because the grid operators love batteries. Batteries dampen volatility and make their job a lot easier as system dispatchers. Well, thank you for that. Now, obviously, the Inflation Reduction Act is a massive bill that I think the industry still is just starting to wrap its head around, or at least a lot of questions still have to be answered. What are you looking at? What do you think the key questions are in terms of implementing this legislation and seeing how big a spur it's going to be for the energy storage industry? Sure. So, as you can imagine, all of the law firms, the accounting firms, the investment banks are working hard almost around the clock trying to understand how it changes the status quo, how it'll change transactions, financing, accounting. And so until IRS guidance is issued, which we expect sometime in the spring of next year, there's a lot of open issues, especially with regard to the 10% bonus on things like Energy Communities Program, Apprenticeship, other labor. In batteries right now, I think it's virtually impossible to qualify for the domestic content rule. We can get domestic inverters, but you probably can't get domestic batteries. But there's a lot of technical aspects that are yet to be clarified. I think with respect to financing around the ITC, that's where we spend the most time and have the most uncertainty. You're talking about a program where you'll get tax credits, which can be used in the future for up to several years, backward looking taxes. The market is expecting that this transferability market will be enormous eventually. But at first, there may only be a few banks that can effectively use the tax credit in the super short term. And so we expect that those credits will sell at somewhat of a discount to market. You may even be required to buy transfer insurance, which is a product which we've seen historically on other transferable credits. And so we think that the assets will qualify for about 90% of what they think they will get. But that's a guess. We know of at least two banks and consulting firms that are launching marketplaces to help facilitate the sale and transfer of these credits. And we do expect a lot of banks and large corporations to step in and say, hey, I'm going to support the energy transition by buying tax credits. Now, again, buying a tax credit at a discount that's profitable, it's actually very easy for a company to do, but it really does help people like us. And it is super necessary for allowing renewables to achieve better financing. And do you think that the IRA will bring new kinds of investors into the energy storage and the renewable energy space? So that's a great question. I think that the biggest change will likely come from munis, municipalities, that is pensions and endowments because of the direct pay, which was something that was pushed heavily in the build back better, but didn't come to full fruition. It's only available for non-tax paying entities. So if you are a municipality and you want to buy solar, wind, a battery in your community, you can actually get the direct payment from the treasury department. And so we actually think that the pensions and endowments, because there are sophisticated investors that are already playing in the renewable space, will end up being the largest owner of renewables in the US outspending all of the, you know, some of the Japanese banks and insurance companies, the European utilities. We really think that the sort of local domestic pensions and endowments will have the lowest net cost of capital to acquire projects. Well, that'll be interesting. It'll be interesting to see whether we see a lot of new players enter the space there. Now, we're having this conversation in November and obviously there is a lot of optimism, but it's funny. If we were having this conversation earlier in the year, say early spring or the winter, we would be focused pretty much on rising costs and supply chain issues, which have not only been dogging the storage space, but renewables in general. Now they've become less of a focus, but they haven't gone away completely. What is the state of supply chain issues when it comes to energy storage? I mean, are developers still having a lot of challenges getting the equipment that they need? So they are. It's less of the big items and more of the small items. I think that if you need to procure batteries, that's something you can do. If you need a transformer, that might be a 50 week lead time. And that's a pretty generic item that should be readily available. But because the whole world is really building out sort of renewables at the same time, aux power transformers, main power transformers, a lot of small control panels and control gear that aren't the headline items, they become the gating item in the project. And so, yes, there are transformers available 40 to 50 weeks out. Inverters are available 35 weeks out. Quality is probably about the same. And so because there are so many pieces of the puzzle, all you need is one shortage and you have a problem. When it comes to labor, there was a lull when the triple B didn't pass. There were a lot of projects which didn't move forward. And so there was a six month lull where there was plenty of excess labor. The minute the IRA passed, we saw the labor market tighten up considerably. And so now we are working with our partners to secure sort of people and projects for the next 18 months. But I do think that the EPC part of the business will get tighter and tighter. On the battery side, it's kind of tricky. You have, I think the press reports, over 30 different gigafactories globally under production, which means very soon you're going to have almost a, I don't want to say an unlimited amount of battery production available, but then you start talking about lithium and other mineral shortages, in some cases, cobalt, nickel. And so you could run into a place where you have tons and tons of battery factories, but not enough raw materials to run them. And so if you've been following lithium markets, yes, in the first half of the year, we had a major run up and then we sold off a little bit. But if you look over the last week, you've seen a meaningful increase again in lithium costs. And so there have been a lot of well-known battery manufacturing companies and auto companies out there talking about lithium shortages really being the key to our whole space. I have to agree with that. And so I think the lithium shortage over the next decade or at least seven years is really what's going to limit battery energy storage build out. I think the autos will be able to pay more in general and the battery energy storage will come last. So we think it's going to be a lot less installed than forecasters are saying. And when you say a lot less, how much? And I mean, if you look at the logic behind incentivizing batteries in the IRA, it's well, this money is going to go towards building out more projects. But there's also the concern that if there are these limiting factors, whether it's lithium, whether it's the other parts that are not available, is it just going to drive up prices for these limited items or this limited equipment and not end up leading to the build out that's expected? I mean, to what degree do you think these shortages are going to limit the positive impact of the IRA? The utility industry as a whole doesn't like to move quickly, right? You have tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars invested in infrastructure. And so they like to do large changes slowly. In my soul, I think that their 10 year plan for allowing widespread, you know, DG battery rollout is probably too slow. But in general, the utility industry likes time to study things from an engineering point of view, understand what the consequences will be. And so I think these kind of shortages, while they'll frustrate battery developers like me, are probably good for the utilities and the industry at large, because it'll give people time to create all the right policies, procedures, train the right staff to build more slowly, but probably more intelligently. So we could see not as speedy a build out in the short term, but in the medium to long term, it'll be very positive. Is that what I understand? Absolutely. Yeah. So if the country wants to build out 10 gigs a year of storage, maybe they'll only build out six or seven gigs a year of storage, right? And even with the tax credit, it'll really be about getting the batteries on time. All right. Well, thank you for that, Andrew. And what are your goals in terms of how big you want Spearman to grow over the coming years? So if you read through all the literature and forecasts in the market, the ranges for the U.S. are somewhere between 125 gigawatts and 700 gigawatts of storage. We think that the real answer is probably somewhere in the middle. And we think that over the next seven to 10 years, there's no reason that we can't develop 3000 to 7000 megawatts and be 1% of the U.S. battery charge market. So that is a lot of total megawattage that would be coming online. That's one way of putting it. Oh, great. Well, we're running short on time, Andrew, but before we go, I want to hear what can we expect to see from Spearman Energy in, let's say, the next three years? You know, we're true believers in storage on a national level. We're partnering with real estate owners, landowners across the country to help locate and connect batteries to support all the ISOs. We think that the solar and wind build out will be prolific and probably will go faster than storage. And so that'll provide us the opportunity, but really the need, really the need to allow, you know, more renewables to hit the grid. In the coming years, we do expect further pricing on carbon. I think this week we saw Excel accelerated one of their coal retirements. And so the world is changing probably faster than we can build out to respond to it. And batteries are the solution. Batteries are the warehouse of power that have been missing for the last 50, 70 years. Well, thank you for that, Andrew, and thank you again for your time and sharing your insights.

I'm Alex McLeod, and I head the EMEA Research Division here at InfoLogic. I'm joined by Giulio Comellini, Head of Americas, and special guest, EMEA News Editor Stefano Berra. Welcome both. Hi, Alex. 2021 was a record-breaking year for infrastructure finance with over $1 trillion of dealmaking across over 3,000 transactions. With the help of Giulio and Stefano, this podcast aims to unpack the data for the first half of 2022, making some comparisons and exploring some key trends and takeaways. So to start, in the second quarter, total global deal value hit just under $200 billion. This was the lowest quarter since 1Q21. But to place this in context, 4Q21 and 1Q22 were unusually high. 1Q22 posted deal activity that more closely resembled a fourth quarter. So overall, although the first half of this year was record-breaking with nearly $470 billion of deals made, it was in no small part due to the first quarter. Meanwhile, results from 4Q21 tower over previous years, so they seem to represent the exception rather than the rule. And we await to see whether those lofty heights will be achieved again this year. Next, global refinancing numbers took a hit in the second quarter, dipping to just below $43 billion, a 31% decrease from just over $62 billion the same time last year. So if we think about the major events that happened this year, we can understand why. The invasion by Ukraine of Russia in February 2022 and the subsequent decisions by European and other markets to wean themselves off Russian gas has had a knock-on effect on energy prices, which were already high due to the COVID-19 supply shock and other factors. The inflation we're experiencing, unprecedented, at least in most of our lifetimes, and the interest rate hikes have caused sponsors and lenders to be cautious. InfoLogic's head of data, Juan Pereira, wrote in his recent article that last year's record activity was driven by a desire to get deals done before an anticipated jump in inflation rates. And that's an interesting point. Giulio, do you fancy breaking this down perhaps a bit further for our listeners? Yeah, Alex. I mean, I think it's very interesting how, despite all the global uncertainties you just mentioned, and we're currently experiencing, that that figures increased year over year, especially for loans, right? I mean, we saw many Greenfield projects securing long-term financing, such as the financing for the Plaquemines-Pearish LNG in the US, but also the expansion of JFK's Terminal 1 in New York City. But I'm also thinking, still in the US, of the finally funded Maryland Purple Line PPP. We saw many Greenfield projects finally getting funded all by loans. Actually, the Maryland Purple Line P3 was funded through tax-exempt bonds, but it was kind of the exceptions. Loans figures recorded a volume of around $215 billion in this first half of the year. And this is actually a record recorded at InfraLogic if we only take into account the first two quarters of the year. However, if loans went up, bonds actually decreased quite massively, frankly, because it was around a 35% decrease year over year. Especially for refinancing, we saw way weaker figures in bond issuances. I said before, there are many components, but also it's something in line with the fact that we come from a record year, such as 2021 in dealmaking. Thanks, Giulio. That's really interesting. Do you notice any specific sectoral trends? Yeah. I mean, if we just focus on the energy transition sphere, which for InfraLogic does not include renewables, I think it's very interesting the steady growth of dealmaking, so we saw many, many deals closing, especially in the LNG subsector. We're still not very, very sure if this is related to the war in Ukraine. And as you said, the fact of relying less on Russian gas, but a lot of focus has been put on this sector right now. So I said many, many deals, but especially large deals. I'm thinking of multi-billion dollar financing, such as the Chenier's Corporate Christie 3 project in the US, but also the Pluto Train 2 in Australia, which was acquired by GAP, or the sale of a 10% stake of Semper Infrastructure Partner that happened last month, and it was acquired by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. So it's a very, very hot market. On the other hand, however, we saw a decrease in the deal value for transaction in the renewables sector. Especially last quarter, we saw a decrease in both solar and onshore wind deals, right? And they are basically the main subsectors of renewables, and they would usually carry the market. But again, especially second quarter, big decrease. Interesting. Thanks. Yeah, it would be good also to mention transport, which has had a bit of a different story. So transport had a strong year so far this year. In the second quarter, the sector reached $58 billion in value across 104 transactions. In fact, it was the top sector in InfoLogic's 1H22 rankings, surpassing other usual leaders like renewables and telecoms for the first time since 4Q 2018. So the sector owes its position to several massive deals this year, including the $18.9 billion sale of the ASPI. I won't attempt the Italian pronunciation with two Italians on the call. ASPI highway concession by Idizione to a consortium of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, CDP, and Macquarie. And in 1Q22, the $23.6 billion sale of Sydney Airport to a consortium of IFM, Australian Super, GIP, and the Australian Retirement Trust. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it was very hot market, but also telecommunications performed very, very well. Yes, indeed. It would be remiss of me not to mention telecoms, which has posted a big growth since COVID-19, thanks to the efforts of investors and governments to improve fiber broadband capabilities. But in fact, the trends for this sector, they broadly mirror the overall figures discussed at the outset. 2Q22 was a comparatively small quarter, the smallest since 1Q21, with 80 deals closed at just over $32 billion. As a comparison, the quarter before, deal value was over twice as high. But of course, $32 billion is no insignificant amount. And a host of multi-billion dollar deals were also closed in the second quarter. The largest of those was a $4.9 billion debt raise for infrastructure fund-backed fiber operator, City Fiber. Yeah, Alex. I mean, obviously, you being the head of the EMEA team, you keep mentioning the European deals. But also in North America, we saw a very, very exciting market. So many opportunities, even though we saw a minor volume of deal making year over year, but very high values in closed transactions. And this is because basically the deals they closed were very large. Again, we mentioned before some, the LNG ones, JFK, Maryland Purple Line, and basically all these ones, they carry the market, right? In the US, I just want to mention that energy and transportation were the best performers year over year. Renewables, again, not so much. But I just want to mention that this week, the Democrats agreed on a legislative package of $370 billion in clean energy spending. And this actually gives a little bit more of hope to this sector. Not many deals on this have been released yet. But what's out there is that the bill could support investments in renewables, hydrogen, and energy storage. So again, very, very exciting, and many opportunities ahead. Yeah, interesting, indeed. Very interesting on the US's strong performance. Because Europe over recent years, bar one quarter in Q3 last year, it always comes above North America when it comes to total deal value and deal volume. But this quarter, it was $18 billion below. So I don't actually have any solid or well-grounded conclusions as to why. But I suppose, again, coming back to the Ukraine situation, investors may have become more cautious in certain sectors and in certain markets. Nevertheless, a top performer was the Italian market in 1H22. And coming back to the massive ASPI deal mentioned earlier, Stefano, what are your thoughts? Will we see deals of a similar magnitude? Yes, Alex. So I think the large increase in deal volumes in the Italian market that we have seen recently was certainly led by some mega deal, mega transactions in transport and fiber, and in particular, the ASPI sale that you just mentioned. And the ASPI sale, to give a bit of context, was the sale of an 88% stake in Autostrade Per l'Italia, which is the largest toll road company in Italy, to a consortium of CDP, Macquarie, and Blackstone. And the equity value of the deal was $8.2 billion. So it's far above other recent deals in Italy. But before that, we've seen other deals of that magnitude in recent months. So we've seen, for example, the investments by KKR in Telecom Italia's fixed line network in Italy. We've seen the investments by Macquarie in Open Fiber, which is another fiber operator. And we've also seen an investment by Ardian in Inuit, which is the largest telecom tower company in Italy. And before that, we've also seen another toll road transaction in Italy that was particularly large, which is the fake privates of ASTM, the second largest road operator. So clearly, there's been a number of deals that are unusually large for the Italian markets in the past few months. And what we normally see after several deals of this size is often a dip in the market where transaction volumes go down. However, at the moment, what we can see is that there are several transactions in the making that indicate the numbers could actually go up in the next quarters. One is the deal that you mentioned earlier, the fake private of Atlantia. Atlantia is the former owner of ASPI. And it also still owns, after the sale of ASPI, a number of other toll road assets and airport assets too. What we're seeing at the moment is Ediziona, the holding company of the Benetton family, one of Italy's wealthiest families and well-known families, that has teamed up with Blackstone Infrastructure to buy up and delist Atlantia. And the expected equity value of this deal is 19 billion. So more than twice as much as the ASPI deal. And another mega deal that is on the horizon is a possible sale by Telecom Italia, the telecoms incumbent in Italy, possible sale of the rest of their fixed network. And that, again, is a huge deal, which analysts expect could be valued at 21 billion. So if you take these two deals currently ongoing that could close or could happen soon, we're looking at 40 billion of potential investments coming down. And on top of that, there's also other possible transport deals in the wings that are more uncertain, that largely depend on traffic recovery and what happens with passenger numbers and traffic after COVID-19. One is the possible sale of Italo, which is the main private high-speed rail operator in Italy that is being discussed at the moment. The deal is very much uncertain. We don't know if the sale is going to happen or not, but it's a possibility. And another one that is being discussed is the privatisation of Catania Airport, a large airport in Sicily that could also take place in the coming months. And there are also other deals that are being prepared in the digital infrastructure space. One deal that we've seen recently of a certain magnitude was the acquisition by Asterion of a fiber and data center company. So there is clearly the signs of a pipeline of deals coming down the line. Interesting indeed. What are your thoughts about all this? What's the outlook for the future, do you think? We need to consider what was the reason for a lot of these deals. Some of the deals have been driven by unexpected events. For example, the sale of Aspi was driven by pressure from the previous government after the tragic collapse of the general bridge that the company was managing. So this is a deal that was in many ways exceptional. But many of the deals, of the other deals that we've seen happening and are seeing could happen in the future, are linked to structural factors and investment opportunities that we are seeing also elsewhere in Europe and elsewhere in the world as well. So this points to probably a continuing deal flow in Italy. So I think there are the basis there for a developing market. So some of these trends we've seen elsewhere in Europe, we've seen clearly the need for more private investment in digital infrastructure that is driving some of these deals. We have seen also a shift of ownership of established infrastructure assets from public markets, so stock markets, to private market ownership, so to infrastructure funds. This is particularly strong in transport. The reason for this is largely because public markets are being hit by the selloff that has been going on for some months, while private infrastructure funds tend to take a longer term view. Another key trend that we are seeing in Italy, that we are seeing also elsewhere in Europe, is the growth of investment in renewable energy. We've seen some significant deals in recent months, like the acquisition of Falk renewables by the IAF fund of JP Morgan. We've seen other brownfield deals being prepared and a lot of greenfield development taking place, particularly in solar and offshore wind. All of these are trends that have structural reasons behind them and are expected to continue. So in many ways, we've seen that the Italian marketing recently, in the past few months and maybe a year or 18 months, has become more aligned with other European markets and is following some of the same trends that we've seen in other markets, which is probably something that wasn't happening a few years ago. So again, in the next few months, we might see the Italian market affected by the same factors that are creating uncertainty elsewhere in Europe. For example, the crisis in Ukraine, the energy crisis, the rising inflation, rising interest rates. So these are things to watch out for. Now for Italy specifically, we might also be at a turning point driven by internal politics, because we've seen just in recent weeks, the collapse of the government of Mario Draghi. Since the beginning of 2021, Draghi has played a stabilising role that has convinced lots of investors and has been largely welcomed. For example, the role of the government was important because Draghi took a lot of political heat out of some of the mega deals that were being prepared. For example, the merger between the network of Telecom Italia and Open Fibre, because he was signalling to investors that he preferred the market to take its course rather than the government to drive deals. So that was a very welcome position that drove a lot of investments. However, we've seen the government has just collapsed, there are new elections coming up on the horizon. So a lot of the certainty and a lot of the confidence that has motivated investors could suddenly disappear. So this is clearly something to watch.

I am Gabriela Valente, reporter for InfraLogic in Brazil. In this episode, we will discuss the thriving market for digital infrastructure and the development of 5G technology in Brazil. We will be joined by Cicero Oliveiri, Vitao's Chief Technology Officer. Cicero is an engineer with a solid career in telecommunications and is now working to develop Vitao's 4,000 kilometers of neutral fiber network. Vitao was born from the acquisition of fiber assets from the Brazilian telecom company OIT by PTG Factual's investee company, GlobeNet, and one of its investment funds. Cicero, thank you for joining us. Thank you for the invitation, Gabriela. Happy to be here on the Crossroads Podcast and to be able to talk about such an important subject for the infrastructure and development of Brazil. Brazil's telecom sector has been pretty busy lately in terms of transactions and investments. The country itself is geographically huge and has a high demand for telecom services, but the 5G technology is a new chapter, right? We had frequency auctions last year requiring around $29 billion in investments to expand infrastructure and take on activity across the country. So, Cicero, in this scenario, what role a neutral fiber optics wholesale operator will play? Gabriela, the role of a neutral fiber optics network wholesaler such as Vitao is pretty important to support the demands of 5G technology. It's interesting to understand that the 5G, it's a new technology, is supported by three pillars. The first pillar is evolved mobile broadband, that it means that the average speed of user of 5G will be 100 times higher than the average speed of 4G users. The second pillar is massive machine type communication. It means that the technology will be in condition to support in an area of one square kilometers. It's able to support more than 1 million devices talking to each other in the network. It will make available the internet of the things. And the third pillar is ultra reliable low latency communication. It means that the answer of a request should take no more than one millisecond, 0.001 second, make feasible automatous car and other technologies that are promising for the 5G. All these demands, to accomplish all these applications, it's mandatory to have fiber optics, to connect antennas with fiber optics. 5G will demand at least 10 times more antennas than we have today deployed in Brazil. And all these antennas should be connected with fiber optics to support these demands. Beside that, the infrastructure of data center to support edge computing, it will be mandatory for the low latency that the technology requires. It means that we will spread all around Brazil, more data centers supporting this multimedia content, very close to the end user. And Vital, as an infrastructure company, will be supported the carriers in these two pillars. That is fiber optics. We have the largest fiber optics network in Brazil. It's more than 400,000 kilometers. And we have more than 2,300 cities reaching fiber optics. Beside that, we have already three data centers built in Latin America, and we are building other three in Brazil. It means that Vital is prepared to support the carriers to deploy this new technology. And what kind of investments will be needed to make 5G feasible? What type of infrastructure and in which regions we will see the majority of investments right now? This is a strategic point. The mobile operators that want the option to implement and operate 5G in Brazil have goals and deadlines established by the regulatory agency, ANATEL, which must be met. And this will require a lot of money. There is no way to implement all the necessary infrastructure at the same time in all of more than 5,000 Brazilian cities, in all states and in all regions. As you said, Brazil, it's a large country, precisely because of the large investments required and the time for execution. This is where the advantage of hiring a neutral network to connect all these antennas and tower structures come in. Since, in this case, the investment is made by the company that installed the optical fiber, such as Vital, I reinforce that it is not just about connecting an antenna or a tower, but thousands of them. And these towers and antennas are connected to points of presence for regional data centers of these operators, which, in turn, need to transport the data to their central instructors and bring it back. Vital has, as I said, a strong network with more than 400,000 kilometers, reaching more than 2,300 cities in all states of Brazil. And this infrastructure will be an important enabler for 5G to get everywhere faster, benefiting more people. We are already carrying out pilots with some customers to act intensively in this implementation of this new technology. Cicero, could you give us an idea of which type of specific fiber networks will have to be built? Will it be more backbones or secondary networks? All kinds of fiber infrastructure, Gabriela. It means that, of course, when you go to the cities, you need to densify your antennas and deploy a lot of small cells. And all these antennas will need fiber optics. It means that the capillarity of the networks in the main cities and large and medium cities will be very, very high. In the second hand, the amount of traffic will grow exponentially compared with the traffic that we have today carried by the mobile carriers. It means that for this side, we will need to have a strong and elastic backbone fiber in the backbone connecting city. It's unimaginable to have any kind of city with real 5G offer without fiber optics backbone connection. It means that all the cities that we have today in Brazil that doesn't have fiber optics connection for the backbone will need to find a way to reach them with fiber. Otherwise, the technology will not be sustainable and efficient. In the other hand, we need to add, as I said, that an important point for the 5G is the edge computing. It means that in any city, when you are deploying 5G infrastructure to have a real 5G supporting the three pillars that I commented before, it's mandatory to have an infrastructure like a call center, a small call center with an instructor to support the applications that will be offered to the user through the carriers. To support that, you need to have buildings, point of presence with the infrastructure of air condition, power prepared to support the servers that will be required. Besides their fiber backbone, we have data center infrastructure in place for the main cities in Brazil and we have more than 3,000 point of presence structure with this 9999 infrastructure available that are supporting our telecommunication network. In a very fast way, in a very cheaper way, we can transform it in edge data centers to support the edge computing, as I said. I think the main drivers of investment will be on these three main pillars that is metropolitan fiber, the needs of densified small cells in the city. The backbone, it's mandatory to have fiber connection in the city and edge data centers. You mentioned 40 clients. We know that Oi is an anchor client for Vitao, but there is a discussion in the market regarding the lack of new clients for neutral fiber networks. I would like to know your thoughts about it. How do you see an increase in competition among the service providers? We saw this neutral net market at this time and in the future, and we understand the movement of concentration as natural, where the smaller providers have been acquired by others of greater size and financial capacity. In our view, this movement does not interfere with the expansion of fiber optics network. Maybe it's the other way around. Larger providers will also have greater capacity to expand their areas of operation to compete with other larger providers. And this will only be feasible by sharing an already existing neutral network. Otherwise, they will have to invest a lot of money to build their own network. The arrival of 5G will also be a factor that will require a lot of fiber optics infrastructure to support new services, as I said, that sooner or later will also be available in our Brazilian cities. To increase their revenues, providers cannot just think about selling connectivity. It will not work anymore. And for the requirements of 5G, it will be really impossible for the providers, the smaller ISPs, even the big ones, to support the demand of capex that will come with this technology. They will need to increase the services offered, such as monitoring by cameras, and many others, including public ones, already thinking about the advantage of smart cities. And they can offer mobile, like MVNOs, for instance, fixed broadband internet consumption in homes. And it's increasing day by day. And only fiber optics network will be able to support so much data being transported. But not only that, we still don't understand all the demands that will come with new technologies, like those of the metaverse. We only know that there will be services and solutions that demand very low latency, which represents the need for an even more robust connectivity infrastructure, without the interference coming to mobile connectivity. Then, for all these reasons, fiber optics network will be even more necessary and strategic for Brazil and any other company. Could you give us a glimpse of Vitao's plans in terms of infrastructure extension? Besides the networks and data centers, what other infrastructure services Vitao is aiming to develop? Vitao has an ambitious investment plan. The plan, we are talking about R$ 30 billion for the next five years, which is already being carried out. In addition to the infrastructure of the company, which has been happening more intensively since the approval of the deal by the regulatory agency, Vitao is adding 500,000 new home passengers per month, in a total of 17 million addresses that can hire internet services from one of our customers in July, with the goal of reaching 34 million home passengers by 2025. We also offer many other digital services, such as cloud computing, edge data centers. As I said, we have today three edge data centers among 200 to 400 hex capacity. We have deployed in Barranquilla, in Colombia, we have in Fortaleza, and we have deployed the data center in Rio de Janeiro. And we are building, we are constructing another three, the second one in Barranquilla and the second one in Fortaleza. And another one in the south of Brazil, in Porto Alegre. Join it with the submarine cable that today Vitao has 26,000 kilometers of fiber that we can complement the offer to our customers, not only for fiber in Brazil, but to connect it with other Latin American countries. We have connections among Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and the United States. All this cable used to be operated by Globinet. And now Globinet, as a company, was incorporated by Vitao, which belonged to BTG. And what are the financing options under study to support this expansion? Gabriela, this is a very important question. Okay, Vitao will use all available credit generation possible, in addition to generating revenue from the sale of its services. It has already made the first debenture issue this year of 5.7 billion reais. And at some point in the future, it should carry out an IPO, becoming part of the stock market, which will certainly help to leverage the necessary resources to sustain its steady growth, with a solid and sustainable capital structure. It's important to reinforce that even in this moment, that all this finance, this difficult inflation of the market, Vitao, even being a new company, were able to raise this 5.7 billion reais to support their plans of growth. And we are deploying more than 500,000 home passes per month this year. And we'll finish the year with over 5 million new home passes, as we are planning, even in this new financial condition of the market. Would you say the IPO will be the main source of funds to support the expansion? No, as I said, it will be a mix of different sources. We raised already, we made the first debenture issue, and it is the main source of the investments of this year. That is, we raised 5.7 billion reais, and the IPO will help for when the company will be in condition to open the capital, will help and will be another source of funds. Well, Cícero, it was a pleasure having you today as our guest. Thank you again, Gabriela. It's a pleasure to be here with you in this Broad World Podcast. This is your host, Gabriela Valente. Thank you for listening to this episode of Crossroads. Like, share and subscribe. Until the next episode!

I'm Chuck Stanley, senior reporter for Energy Policy, and today we're going to be talking about the state of play in the U.S. energy investment market following a landmark Supreme Court case and the collapse of negotiations between Democrats for a clean energy bill in advance of the 2022 midterms. My guest today is Alan Marks, one of the world's leading project finance lawyers whose experience across the infrastructure sector spans three decades. As a partner with Milbank LLP's Global Project Energy and Infrastructure Finance Group, Alan's advisory work includes matters related to the energy transition, clean and renewable power, alternative fuels, ESG, and sustainability. Alan, thanks so much for joining us. How are you today? I'm good, Chuck. Thanks very much. Well, just to start things off, I was wondering if we could talk about the Supreme Court's decision in West Virginia versus EPA and what it means for the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions from the energy sector and pursue the Biden administration's climate goals going forward. Sure. I think the EPA case against West Virginia was a critically important landmark case more broadly than just the energy sector. It affects kind of the nature of the administrative state and the power of agencies to determine how to comply with their directives from Congress as far as what the scope of their regulatory authority actually is. For clean energy and clean energy in particular, the immediate impact of the case is not to change the rules whatsoever. And there are some things that the case did not change permanently. So for instance, the authority of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases, which was affirmed several years ago in the Massachusetts case, that was not challenged. The Supreme Court upheld that. So the EPA still has under the Clean Air Act, both the power and the duty to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including from power plants. Power plants have been regulated for other pollutants since 1971 by the EPA. None of that changes. Here's what does change. The Supreme Court essentially tied the EPA's hands in how it can go about regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Under the rules that were at issue in the case, the 2015 Clean Power Plan that had been adopted by President Obama, but because of various intervening judicial steps and policies taken by the Trump administration, was never implemented. Under the Clean Power Plan, the EPA was working with state governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions using a wide range of tools. The most important of those was generation shifting, in other words, encouraging states and state power regulators to shift their sources of power generation away from coal to natural gas, where that was cleaner, and ultimately away from fossil fuels entirely, away from coal and natural gas to renewables like wind and solar. As I said, the rule was never implemented. The court didn't even have to hear this case, but they chose to nonetheless. And in their decision, they said the EPA can only require emissions controls at the power plant level, in essence, or other things at power plants that will reduce heat rates, efficiency, co-firing, and so forth, perhaps carbon sequestration and capture. But they cannot require, the EPA cannot require grid-wide generation shifting to cleaner resources. So we'll have to see what the new rules will be from the Biden administration within the more limited scope of the regulatory authority. But I suspect the EPA will come out with greenhouse gas emissions regulations that are within that narrower ruling from the court, if not later this year, then next year. Right. And you recently said that by rejecting those sort of industry-wide generation shifting plans that the EPA advanced under the Obama administration, this decision could make it more likely that the EPA pursues climate regulations that are actually more costly at the individual plant level. Could you explain why that might be? Sure. So imagine two different possible outcomes. Outcome one, which the court has said cannot happen. Maybe a state might've said, we want to shut half of our coal plants. The other half can operate as they are currently, but we want to move generation away and have accelerated retirement of coal plants and replace that generating capacity with, say, wind or solar, or maybe cleaner natural gas where that's appropriate for their grid. In that case, if you owned one of the retiring plants, you'd be compensated for some kind of, in accordance with the regulatory regime of the state. We can see now there are still issues around that. So for instance, the same week that this decision came down, within 24 hours of the court ruling, there was a planned retirement, which was completed of unit one of one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the country, San Juan Generating Station in New Mexico. And now the question is, what will that impact beyond rates? Will rate payers get a discount because they're no longer paying for that old coal capacity that no longer exists? Those are economic decisions made at the state level, but a state regulator in compliance with the prior version of the 2015 Clean Power Plan from the EPA could have said, this is the most efficient way to do it. And if they did, the remaining coal plants might have been unaffected. Under this new regime that the court has said could happen, if the EPA wants to regulate coal-fired power plants, then whatever rules they apply will have to have broader applicability. So even legacy plants that are not retired, and there will be relatively few of them in any event due to market conditions, not just regulations, those plants may have to, in order to continue operating, comply with potential new EPA rules that would limit greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants that are associated with coal combustion. And that probably will lead to a more expensive, less effective way of regulating greenhouse gas emissions on a system-wide basis. I see. And of course, the whole time that this case was being considered by the Supreme Court, Democrats were immersed in negotiations and efforts to sort of resurrect the clean energy portions of the Build Back Better Act, a variety of clean energy tax credits and other climate policy proposals that appears to have once again collapsed. I wonder if you could tell me about what that sort of the failure of that legislative component means going forward as we look at the market more broadly and the regulatory aspect of this. Yeah, that's a good question. And it obviously goes beyond the scope of the case. When the court was making its rule, one of the things it was assuming is that Congress would either act or choose not to act on climate regulation and environmental regulation more broadly. And we've already seen with the Build Back Better plan, something proposed by the administration as a change to statutes that's different than regulations under existing laws by existing agencies and the proposals for clean power and more broadly for climate passed the House but stalled in the Senate. And now we've seen with announcements from Senator Manchin, as well as the fact that the Democrats do not have any moderate Republicans that they can rely on as they might have in the past for bipartisan legislation, we're seeing basically status quo where we would not expect, unless there's a change in the politics, to see progress on that package. So if you're an investor sitting back looking at this, and you're trying to decide where do you want to employ your capital, let's say you're an infrastructure fund or an energy fund or even a strategic energy company, and you're trying to guess where you should put money today that will result in the best risk-adjusted return for you and your investors 5, 10, 15, and 20 years from now, what do you do? What you have is regulatory uncertainty because of the Supreme Court's recent rulings, and you have political uncertainty because you don't really know what Congress is going to do. You don't know how electoral cycles are going to play out in the midterms or in the subsequent next presidential election. So that uncertainty could chill some investment. By the same token, I don't want to overstate that because we've already seen a shift away from fossil fuels, away from coal in particular. I shouldn't say all fossil fuels. Gas, of course, has grown quite a bit, but away from older polluting power plants to newer, more efficient ones and of huge growth in solar and wind and other renewables. And why is that? It's in the absence, of course, of the clean power rules from the EPA because those were never enacted, and Trump's package was also set aside by courts. It's happening mainly because of economics and because of state-level regulation. So states have enacted renewable portfolio standards or renewable energy targets, other decarbonization metrics. Large states like California have done this, things that encourage the development of renewable power. And some of that is direct state investment in infrastructure. Texas, for example, invested when Rick Perry was governor significantly in transmission system upgrades, which have allowed wind power plants in the western part of the state and the panhandle to serve load further down south and east in Texas. So that Texas is now the largest producer of wind power and is rapidly growing in solar, notwithstanding its continued investment in gas fire generation. So all of these things have been driven by non-federal regulation. And then, of course, there's a shift in the markets. In particular, the rapid fall in natural gas prices until very recently, but over the last 10 to 12 years, mainly because of fracking technology. So natural gas got a lot less expensive. That, because it provides peaking capacity, made it cheaper and easier to integrate intermittent resources like wind and solar onto the grid. And the fall in prices of solar power components and the growth in scale and efficiency and reliability for wind, as well as dropping prices on wind-generating equipment, has all together with federal tax credits like the ITC and the PTC and the state regulations combined to allow us actually to exceed the climate goals that were set up in the original Obama plan that the Supreme Court just set aside because of other things happening. So I think that if the administration were to pass somehow in, if not in this Congress, but before the next presidential election, if somehow they were able to pass statutes which bolstered support for renewable energy, whether that's additional tax credits or other things, that would spur further investment in that area. If they were to enact legislation which put a price on carbon or clarified the scope of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions together with FERC and other regulators in a more broad systemic way, that would probably also accelerate these investment trends that are happening anyway. We'll have to see. I don't expect that legislation to be resurrected, though, between now and the midterm elections. Right. And it's interesting that you bring up the case of Texas. In the absence of some sort of legislative breakthrough, obviously, we would expect EPA to come out with some regulatory proposal. But, you know, without that federal legislative action, would you expect the states to continue sort of leading the way on this transition? Yeah, I think... Look, I think it's a complicated question how regulation intersects with private investment decisions. So I tend to divide regulation into a few different baskets, but with a big caveat. So one is regulation that creates markets or encourages investment in a certain direction. So the investment tax credit for solar or offshore wind, the production tax credit for onshore wind, you know, these are regulatory tools designed to create markets and to stimulate investment in particular directions. And they work for that. Set aside whether they're the most efficient way to do that. There are other ways one could imagine in Europe. Revenue supports, feed-in tariffs have been more common. But there's other ways you can encourage investment. And we use it across the board. We have a subsidy for nuclear power because we shield owners of nuclear power plants from many liabilities so long as they comply with their NRC licensing requirements. There's a lot of different ways you can subsidize. And we subsidize almost every source of energy production broadly, not just power generation, but across the energy sector as a whole. Another way you can regulate is if you try to prohibit or lessen the incentive to invest in certain areas. And I think a lot of the emissions regulations which come out of the EPA are designed essentially to convert what would be externalities, right? The cost of pollution. If it's 1968 and you have a coal-fired power plant or a steel mill and you're putting out terrible smog creating pollutants, NOx and SOx and ground-level ozone, a reaction to smog in the late 60s and early 70s was for the Nixon administration to form the EPA by executive order for Congress to pass the Clean Air Act and then the Clean Water Act by wide bipartisan majorities in order to combat smog. That gave the EPA the authority by regulation to impose emissions restrictions and require scrubbers and other things that made some of those emissions less and made the generation of power, the production of steel, whatever, you know, cars with car emissions and catalytic converters. It made all those things less polluting. And again, there was always a bipartisan consensus that that was a good idea. Now, that increases costs on the people generating the emissions, which is why some parts of industry or the auto industry might have initially resisted some of those rules. What you're really doing though is not creating a new cost. You're imposing a cost on the generator of the pollution instead of that being an externality. In other words, a cost which is borne on by society, but not economically borne by the generator of the pollution. We are behind that by about 40 or 50 years when it comes to regulating greenhouse gas emissions in the same way. So, there's still an external impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate, but the cost of that carbon or methane emission is not directly borne by the generator of it. So, how do you manage that? So, one way to regulate would be to impose those costs and that would potentially chill investment in that area. A third problem, of course, with this regulation, whether it's encouraging investment in something like renewables or discouraging investment in things where it's now more expensive because you're producing other pollutants, is you may have unintended consequences. And I think it's always a challenge for regulators to look at what those unintended consequences might be. You know, it's interesting to me, if you just look at climate, coal power generation in the United States peaked back in 2007. It's been declining ever since. And this is in the absence of comprehensive climate regulation from the federal government. As I mentioned, natural gas prices falling since 2008 has been a major reason for that. Right now, coal-fired power plants account for about 60% of the greenhouse gas emissions from our power sector. That overall is about a quarter of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So, just behind transportation as the leading source. So, regulating those emissions could have significant impact and really move the needle on climate. To your point there, you know, one of the main reasons that the Biden administration didn't choose to attempt to reimpose the Clean Power Plan was that the goals that were set out under the Obama administration or that plan were met primarily through, as you said, you know, market drivers and state action. The administration has made clear that it plans to stay the course with a drive toward renewables and CO2 emission reductions. The EPA is expected to issue new regulations likely this year to that end. What are investors going to be watching for as that plays out? Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, by the way, you're right. I mean, utilities have retired over 540 power plants just in the last decade that were fueled by coal. And those aging, you know, coal-fired plants are no longer part of the mix. So, we're seeing investors investing in, first, I would say, in new capacity, which is sometimes gas, more often wind, and more often than that, solar. And in solar, the investments, of course, span the gamut from large utility-scale solar to solar commercial and industrial installations, but so-called C&I, and also RESI, a residential solar installation. You will continue to see investment across that. I think we will also see investment in supporting technologies which make the grid more efficient. Transmission upgrades, for sure, to facilitate the new capacity coming in, especially renewable capacity. Energy storage, I think, will continue to see significant new investment. That includes storage associated directly with generation. So, wind plus solar storage, solar plus storage, those projects are still being financed and are highly attractive to investors. Standalone storage, and then storage as part of making the grid smarter. Those will all come. There may be other technologies that will also benefit from further investment depending on the pace of climate legislation and depending on politics. So, hydrogen, especially green hydrogen, is an area to watch here. I think methane capture, methane monitoring, especially for upstream and midstream gas, will be an area for significant investment. A lot of that will be on balance sheet and outside of, you know, say, project financing channels, but I think you'll see a lot of equity investments in that area as well.

This is Andrew Vitelli. I am your host and thank you for tuning in. My guest today is Brendan Duval, the CEO and founder of Glenfarm Group. Brendan founded Glenfarm Group in 2011, has worked in the infrastructure sector for more than 23 years. Today, we're going to talk about the global investment outlook for power and energy, the environment for the US LNG sector, particularly the impact of the war in Ukraine and the challenges facing the renewable sector in the US. Brendan, thank you for joining us today. Andrew, good to talk to you again. It's great to be back. Well, it's great to have you here. So to start out, can you tell our audience a little bit about Glenfarm Group and where your company is focused within the infrastructure sector? For sure. I enjoy talking about it. So Glenfarm Group, we've put all of our energy businesses under a company going forward, Glenfarm Energy Transition. And we did that because of the way we see the global energy transition needs, which is, and I use the phrase, the triangle of transition, which has three key underpinnings to it. Firstly, the world has to move to more renewables and that has to happen at an accelerating rate. But when you make the observation that penetration of renewables is really stalling in many economies and high growth economies due to the lack of grid stability, and grid stability are highly flexible power plants, and those highly flexible power plants are flexible because of the type of fuel. And the best flexible fuel is global LNG and the best global LNG for flexibility is US LNG. And US LNG is flexible financially and logistically. You can push the molecules back into the US matrix and not ship them if there was a problem. And the contracts are written to allow financial flexibility. So if you think the three points of the triangle, renewables, grid stability and global LNG solutions, they're the three business units of Glenfarm. And we're focused on those three because that's the real here and now energy transition. And we're taking that to high growth emerging markets, putting boots on the ground in high growth emerging markets, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc, Malaysia. And that's our business today using US LNG to take that three step solution into high growth emerging markets. And we see that's where the biggest bang for the buck in carbon reduction is going to be. So you bring up LNG, which obviously has become a major global topic since February, when Russia invaded Ukraine, and really spurred questions about the global reliance on Russian natural gas. Now, as you mentioned, your firm's been active in the global LNG space, including here in the US. How did the invasion impact how you approach the market? It really did have an important impact for us. We started out as grid stability developers in Latin America, and that they have highly flexible power plants. So we looked at how can we increase our developing edge. And we realised if we controlled LNG flows, it would give us an edge to being a gas to power developer in the markets were focused on high growth emerging markets. So when we took on our LNG export projects, we were mainly developing them for internal demand. And I remember being in Australia, my first trip back to Australia since the COVID events, and the invasion into Ukraine happened. And the first thing I did is actually called my business partner, Vlad Blutzer, who grew up in the Ukraine. And I said, what are we going to do? And we contact one of our other business partners, Brian Murphy, and we said, we should actually redirect our business plan here. We have an LNG facility, two LNG facilities that are ready to go to FID. And we were going to commit the cargoes to our own projects, we can send those over to Europe. And so we put in place a strategy to market our LNG globally, but into Europe. And part of global LNG, as you know, the more LNG that's on water, it supports the global market. And the more LNG that there is, the more opportunity Europe has to get off Russian gas. So it had a big impact, we think a positive impact. And we're really excited about how we've built out our global marketing capabilities to support the shift from Russian gas to global LNG solutions. And have you been accelerating projects in the US and elsewhere because of the invasion to try to speed up getting more LNG onto the global market? Well, we've accelerated our mindset, but our both our Magnolia LNG project, and our Texas LNG project have their own timeline that is sort of nearly independent of that LNG offtake. And so Magnolia, from a technical standpoint, permitting engineering and everything, it can go to FID as soon as we choose to put it in. And Texas LNG will have all of its requirements in place, end of Q4, early Q1. And that didn't change due to the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. What did was that we're now negotiating LNG offtake agreements with global partners that when they fall into place, we'll immediately announce FID. And what markets are you focusing on for these offtake agreements? You mentioned Europe, which obviously has significant need now to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. Has that been your primary focus? It's Europe, it's Asia, and it's Latin America. So our specialty is high growth emerging markets, but there is just so much demand in Europe. And having European offtake, which generally has a more transparent, creditworthy sort of counterparty to understand, we do have marketing now out of London and out of Barcelona into Europe. So it's sort of the the newest growth in where we're putting people out marketing. But we will have offtake from all three time zones. And you mentioned that the importance of US LNG and the role it can play. Do you think that enough is being done to spur LNG production and export in the US? Or do you think more can be done both by the market and on the policy level by the federal government? Well, firstly, I think the United States with its pro-business mindset, you know, the deepest capital markets in the world and some of the best entrepreneurs in the world, I'm proud to be developing the business here. And to be honest, I couldn't have chosen a better place to grow Glenfarm. So, you know, the best day in the US is often, you know, still better than than doing it in other countries. I think the policies in the US are very supportive of the US being a global facilitator of energy security, right? And no matter which government is in power in the US, the US in general is very supportive of the role of global energy and the US's role in global energy and energy security. So I think there is a lot being done. Like everything, when a permit gets stuck, or there's some sort of policy, you always want to see it move quicker. But to be honest, in all of our interactions at all different levels of government and political parties, we've been very well supported in both of our projects. So I absolutely have nothing to complain about. And when it comes to the global market, obviously, there is the need for LNG. At the same time, Europe and the United States, certain countries have kind of ambitious targets for getting off all fossil fuels and switching over to renewables. I mean, does that create tension when you're trying to come up with offtake agreements to develop projects that are long term projects when countries are saying that they're going to get off natural gas by a certain date? I mean, is that a challenge at all? Is that something that Europe has responded sufficiently to the current situation? It's still being hammered out how the right policies can support a two pronged parallel process, which is, over time, let's talk about Europe, specifically Europe, but we could say for any advanced OECD economy, everyone's targeting zero carbon electricity in the long run. The important thing is we've got to do what we call now here and now energy transition, which is first decommissioning all the coal plants, right? And so the decommissioning of the coal plants can only happen if some more firm capacity is installed. And firm capacity means a power plant that can turn on and off as needed. And so all those governments in Europe know that the only way to replace coal in the medium term is with gas. Now, the question is, how quickly then can a transition from gas happen and or transition to some other fuel such as green hydrogen? And is that 20 years? Is that 40 years? My experience is in most of these markets is that that transition is longer and slower than most people plan for. And in a lot of my conversations on one on one, most political and technical counterparties in Europe will agree that it's actually going to take more like 20 years and not 10 years and not 15 years and beyond 20 years, to be honest. So we've seen that the conversations into Europe and the recognition of two things. One, energy sustainability and energy security. The energy security has to be dealt with now. And if you have energy security, then you can then focus on energy sustainability. And that sustainability will take beyond 20 years and most recognize it. What we're waiting for now is it to be announced clearly at a political level in Europe. All right. Very interesting. Now, you mentioned the importance of ramping up renewables, and that has also been a focus for Glenn Farn. Obviously, the last year has been challenging in the US renewables market in many ways, both supply chain issues, questions regarding tariffs. Do you see things improving in that sense? And how difficult has it been to invest in this climate over the last 12 months or so? So for us, our renewables business at the moment is in Latin America. So in Chile, Panama and growing into Colombia. The same supply chain issues globally have really been there, which is getting panels out of China, the price of those panels varying and the logistics on the ships, getting them to where they need to go. And that definitely has caused challenges and contractors that are building those plants have felt that impact. But in general, I think the community of developers out there and even renewable developers, it's a very robust set of business people and developers never let a supply chain issue stop them from pressing forward. And that's the role of the developer. Right. So we see that the future for renewables and we're looking at stuff in the US as well, and we will be developing some renewables that feed our Texas LNG facility. It's still a great place to be. There's equipment supply available. It's flowing, it's moving. So we remain very positive on renewables and a great place to invest and develop. I agree. Well, thank you for that. Any other sectors that Glenn Farrin is looking at that you think there might be significant opportunities in the coming years? So we've accelerated over the last 18 months our development of LNG import terminals, and so we think getting hard to replicate infrastructure installed and in place and then marketing that LNG supply into high growth emerging markets off those terminals is a really great business. And so we've spent spending time in Latin America and in Southeast Asia with our import terminals development business. And we're very pleased with how that's going. And we've signed a number of strategic joint ventures that are yet to be announced. So that's one area where we're very focused on. Over time, we will be participating and we have some early stage green hydrogen initiatives. And we do believe that staying close to that, albeit it's still an emerging industry, we think being part of the process of understanding how green hydrogen can be produced cost effectively and being on the front of that curve is a good place for us to be. So there are two areas and ultimately the consumption of a gaseous energy source. There's a lot of similarities at the end point of green hydrogen and LNG converted back to gas. All right. Well, thank you for that. Now, what is your investment outlook globally for the power and energy market? So we see it as a great time to be in energy because, you know, there's need for the skills. Right. And what we found is it's really there's usually a lot of capital out there. The real key is to have the skills to develop the projects in a fundable and a financeable way. And that's really where we specialize. So for us, our focus is always on high quality development. And when that's in place, the project finance just follows. And so we do see abundance of project finance available and we continue to always use that capital. What we have seen, in my opinion, is underinvestment in many markets in grid stability. So these highly flexible power plants that turn on and off when the renewables go on and off. And as you know, Andrew, the sun goes down every night, the wind changes in different seasons and hydroelectricity has different rainfall patterns throughout the year, even throughout the day. But most importantly, hydro conditions vary over a five year period where you always have drought years and you have a lot of rainfall. And what we've seen is as weather patterns become more erratic over time, the frequency of all renewables going to their lowest level at the same time is increasing. And so we've seen the big freeze in Texas. We're seeing power plants that are meant to run 1% of the time in Chile running 20% of the time. We saw the Australian energy regulator take over control of the spot market. And a lot of that is due to underinvestment in grid stability in the right locations with the right technologies. And so we see that as a great place for us to continue to invest globally. We've got a real specialty in it and we think grid stability is a true enabler of deep penetration of renewables. And so we'll continue to invest there, we'll continue to invest in global LNG solutions and we'll continue to invest in the right spots in renewables. And we see opportunity in all of our markets for all three. And focusing really on the U.S. from my standpoint, do you think more needs to be done from a policy standpoint to ensure grid stability? I know that's a hot topic here. Well, one of the key policies for grid stability is you never know when you're going to need it. And when you go through periods of time where there's an abundance of normal weather conditions and normal renewable supply, everyone sort of forgets and policy makers and even business decision makers don't remember like three or four years ago. And I think some reason those patterns won't reoccur. And the way other markets have dealt with that is they've put in place long term capacity contracts. And these are contracts that run for 10, 20 years or even into perpetuity under a regulated program. And I think in a lot of the markets that we're seeing now throughout the U.S., adopting some of these strategies where there is a long term capacity payment and that will attract investment into grid stability and the investors aren't making a bet on what the spot market price will be. They're actually making a decision. I'll be available to support the grid in the short term and the long term. And it'll allow for a more financially stable and a more electrically stable grid. And so I do think some lessons learned from other markets can come back to the U.S. Usually it's in the reverse. But in grid stability, I think a lot of the U.S. grids, ERCOT, PJM and whatnot, long term capacity payments, I think, provide an excellent underpinning for a stable grid. So the U.S. should be taking lessons from elsewhere. Yeah. And in a lot of things, it's always reverse. But I do think in this particular setting, other countries have dealt with more erratic weather conditions, mainly the countries that are heavily exposed to hydro, hydroelectricity. And you may have heard of the El Niño and the La Niña phenomenon that's a drought slash heavy rainfall phenomenon that cycles every two to three to four years. Whereas in the U.S., we seem to be having weather patterns that's more related to high temperature and low temperature swings. But both of them have the same impact on the grid, either an excess demand for electricity or an unstable supply, but ultimately a mismatch in supply and demand. And that's where highly flexible power plants can turn on. And if they don't turn on for a period of time, fine. And if they need to turn on for a long period of time, they're financially sound and ready to do it. For the last few years, as far as I can remember, really, we've been in a low interest rate environment. Obviously, that is starting to change. And with inflation now, I think over 9 percent, according to the last report. And at the same time, some economists think we are either headed into or already in a recession. How has that changed the investment opportunities that you're seeing? How is that complicated, investing in energy markets? So I think at least I can talk to the to the Glenfarm perspective. We invest in assets that we expect to own and operate as an entity for 20, 30, 40 years. So we're doing long term planning. So when we invest or we develop, build our assets, we put a long term plan in place that it always exceeds 30 years. And so we want to have an asset that has a revenue model that is inflation protected. And we always like to lock in our interest rates for as long as we can, typically 10 to 20 years. And so that allows us to protect on one side against interest rates rising unexpectedly and on the other side, actually have an inflation hedge where to some extent we're benefiting from that inflation. And so if we continue to do that and we look for places to do that, every new asset that we bring on, we're making that investment decision based on the current interest rate environment and the current inflation environment. So actually, this sort of environment that we're in has has really been pleasing, not from a global humanity standpoint, but to see our business model stack up and really do well. What we all have to be aware of is high inflation ultimately creates stress in the community and stress in economies and weak economies and weak communities is never a good long term business plan. So like everyone else, we want to see inflation come back down. We want to see interest rates come back down. But while we're going through the high period of both, we sleep well at night knowing that we structured our long term business the right way. Well, Brendan, I think that's all the time we have. But this has been a great conversation. I appreciate you joining today and thank you for coming on. It's always a pleasure, Andrew. Look forward to our next chat. Thank you.

Mature Technologies in the US Renewables Market\n**Episode ID:** 4362\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello, my name is Onofrio Castillo, reporter for InfraLogic. Thank you for joining us today. Our topic is new versus mature technologies in the U.S. renewables market. We'll chat at length about how some European capital is weighing investments in asset classes like solar and wind versus perhaps less proven technologies like biogas and storage in the United States. Our guest is Matthias Burghardt, head of Ardian Infrastructure and a member of the executive committee there. He is responsible for technological development at the Paris-based private equity firm. Hello, Matthias. Thanks for joining us. Hello, Onofrio. Good to speak with you. Of course. First of all, let's define what is meant by new and mature technologies. From Ardian's perspective, how do you define each and differentiate between them? We try to be simple. Technologies which are, I would say, mature are technologies which have been operating for decades, like wind onshore and offshore, solar, PV, hydro, and some kind of biomass. Not all can be considered as mature. What is new then? Battery storage, some biofuels or biogas productions, and last but not least, hydrogen. It's not always black and white. Some mature wind technologies, well, some wind technologies are obviously very mature. Some others which are deep-sea wind farms can be considered as new, or at least from the risk profile, will embed some technological risk. I appreciate the need for nuance. Obviously, there's a lot of conversation all throughout the world about the new technologies that are going to be developed. I mean, we've heard about geothermal in Japan, and of course, Ardian has been active in developing green hydrogen. So, I do think that it will mean different things to different people. To move on, is investing more heavily in mature technologies just a matter of hedging your bets? Is it strictly economic? Or is there another, perhaps less obvious reason? Is there an ideological element to investing in new technologies in particular? Well, on the Ardian side, I think compared to other peers, we have really a more industrial approach. That's why we only focus on three industrial sectors, energy, transport, and telecom. On the energy, I think from a risk profile, the best thing when you're a long-term investor is to be diversified. So it's good to rely on mature technologies, which provide, I would say, more certainty, but you still have a lower return to the technologies, which may bring not only more return, but also a certain level of hedging against obsolescence of the more mature technology. That's why, for example, in our American fund, we are combining both wind, solar, and battery storage, because I think the best protection or the best return is not the sum of individual investments, but rather the right mix. Obviously, we have a strong conviction on energy transition, and we really believe that hydrogen, clean hydrogen, as you mentioned, will be an important element, a critical element of the future mix. That doesn't mean necessarily that we consider from the risk-return profile is today eligible towards regular, I would say, infrastructure funds. That's why we have launched a specific fund for clean hydrogen, and I have to say that the success has been much beyond our expectations. Can you compare and contrast the commercial market for each, and by each, I of course mean new and mature technologies in the U.S. right now? How do sellers differ from one another, and what kinds of buyers are you competing with? That's a good question. Well, basically, both markets, you will find the institutional investors and GPs. Maybe the difference, the slight difference you will see in Europe is that you have more strategic buyers, utilities, and also all companies are probably a little more active in Europe than we see in the U.S., where energy funds and institutional investors are probably the bulk of our competitors. Can we break this down by assets versus platforms? You told me in a previous conversation that Ardian will favor assets in the near term. Obviously, right now in the U.S., there's a premium for operational solar assets, given the supply chain and other macroeconomic issues. When considering new technologies, is it better to approach platforms or assets, and why? The reality is that today, when there is a platform for sale, investors are ready, whether strategic investors or whether financial investors, a significant premium to get access to this platform that will allow them to invest then on new assets and projects. For me, this premium has been just too high in the recent times. Many things are changing with the change in the macro environment. But our approach is slightly different and maybe ahead of the rest of the market. We believe that in the future, financial investors or GPs like us cannot just be mere investors buying at the right point in time, bet on the right management, and then sell. We have to bring value to the management team of the platform we buy or the assets we buy. That's why we are recruiting ourselves, industrial engineers, experts in operation and maintenance of turbines, experts of construction of wind or solar plants or CCGTs. So we have to compete and provide a similar service that will provide a strategic investor. Otherwise, you will be just competing for cost of capital. In an environment where costs of capital tend to go up, you will really struggle to meet returns. That's why I think that the next stage really is that people like us have not only the specialists, people, the engineers, which are knowledgeable about construction, operation, optimization, hedging on the energy market, but also develop their own operation systems. And you know that we have developed our operation system and risk energy market system as well called OPTA. So now, for me, the next type of GPs or asset managers in the energy space will have to be an hybrid animal between the flexibility of a financial investor and the technical expertise and capabilities of a strategic investor. We've touched on macroeconomic issues such as supply chain entanglements, inflation and geopolitical conflict, what with the tariffs with China and the war in Ukraine. Have these issues impacted one class more heavily than the other? If so, how? Basically, we are just at the beginning to assess the full impact of this crisis. We are seeing that companies which are sensitive to inflation and cannot pass through the full impact of the cost of energy or have difficulties on the supply chain are suffering more than others. We are really focused as an infrastructure investor, really, on the inflation link, real assets, which obviously have a better protection. On more specifically on the renewable energy sector, we have seen all the sector which has plans under construction experiencing delay between three and six months. And that's probably not the end of it. The cost of equipments are higher. So that's where I think there will be a difference between experienced, I would say, fund managers, which have the capability to negotiate with the suppliers and people which are less experienced, which maybe have been more aggressive, relying for future developments on debt or capital markets, which will not be there. So that's where we will see more difference. Also, back to your point between mature and more, I would say, new technologies, then again, there is a fly for quality. We see, we expect banks and debt to be supporting, essentially, not only the most proven and resilient projects, but also to limit the number of counterparts they want. So there will be, again, more selectivity of the banks, which will favor stronger players with stronger capacity and lower risk. To ask a question on the fly, I wonder, do you think some of these valuations and new technologies might be a bit inflated in the near term because of these multiple geopolitical and social crises that we've been experiencing? I mean, if the supply chain works itself out in the near term, if the war in Ukraine is resolved, the Biden administration lifts the Chinese tariffs, I don't know that there's a lot of indication that they will, but I suppose it's possible. Could some of these things go down? Could the valuations drop in some of these newer classes? The economics don't work so much anymore. I mean, I think a lot of hay has been made about how hydrogen is more competitive now than it was before the war in Ukraine. So I'm just wondering, like, could some people maybe be caught holding the bag, so to speak, if these valuations drop? I think, obviously, different investors or reasonable investors are not taking for granted that the energy price will remain as high for longer. We assume that maybe in the next 18 months to a year we'll still have a high price, but at some point they will come back to more normal levels. Nevertheless, clearly, we will not go back to the previous prices. Why? Because I think there's a before and an after the Ukraine war, and somehow there's also a vision which is now different on the benefit and risk of the globalization. Globalization was about reducing costs of production, and that was the main driver of our economy and business decisions. Now we realize that cost is obviously a very important factor. However, it's not the only one. Security of supply is as critical, and we see that Germany have exposed themselves to an incredible high risk by putting all their eggs on the Russian energy, which is fueling the second largest, I think, economy industry in the world. So we see that also, and we realized that in the COVID crisis, having all our standard medicine produce thousands of kilometers from our market has also risk. So that's why, despite after this crisis, which will take at least a couple of years, the price of energy will be lower, but they will embed more costs due to security and need of diversification of the mix. And also, I'm convinced the need for decarbonization of the economy, which again, will make that the only criteria will not be the cost. So the cost of energy will be higher in the future and will need to be cleaner and safer. And safer, I mean, more local production in the mix. Fantastic. On locating acquisitions in the United States, the process of it, what kinds of personnel needs come with each mature and new technologies? Do you need team members with different areas of expertise to find each one? Or is there enough crossover, the competency in one lends itself to the other? Have you found yourself having to have a wide net when it comes to personnel and expertise to be able to do both? Today, as I was mentioning before, a fund investor, a GP, cannot just be just a financial investor having just very good financial backgrounds in their team. You need also to have industrial backgrounds, engineers capable of operating and maintaining your plants. You know, they are the most efficient in terms of operation, but also in terms of adding new technologies. That's why, for example, we call a lot today's world in the energy market, when you have a plant, you need to do the repowering, meaning increasing the size of your and replace your turbine by a bigger turbine, taking advantage of the sites, but also hybridization, which is basically when you have, for example, wind farm putting solar plants using the same grid connection. So taking the full advantage of your existing access to the network, which has obviously a lot of value. And also because you diversify the technologies, you are able to basically provide a more predictable energy production output. I do feel like I've spoken to a number of people, mostly U.S. buyers who feel like, well, they have competency in one class. They've been doing solar, they've been doing wind. And, yeah, they would like to get into some of the new emerging technologies, but they don't really know who to hire is a big problem, exactly how to find the right people to be able to do it well. So I do think that there's a lot of consternation in this country around that. But to move on to financing, when it comes to sourcing additional financing after you've made an acquisition, perhaps for project debt, construction debt, what challenges are unique to each mature and new technologies? Is it more difficult to raise that kind of capital for the newer technologies? Is it more expensive? Can you contrast those two for us? No, I agree. And this problem is becoming more acute. Obviously, the banks traditionally, they want to finance the more mature technologies, not to be exposed to market risk. So it's even more true today. And today we see that the debt has disappeared for many sectors. We see that in the private equity world, much less debt is available. And when it's available, it's much more expensive. In the infrastructure space, we still have access to debt, in particular for, I would say, counterparts like us or the big guys, which have, I would say, a strong reputation and bank relationship. So clearly, if you are a new developer or new small size fund manager, and you specialize on new technologies in the energy space, it will be very difficult. So that will be, I would say, a flight for quality. But it doesn't mean that, for example, you cannot invest in new technologies. I mean, the fact that we raised so fast our hydrogen fund, much faster than we have anticipated, shows that with the right team, and that's where your comment was absolutely true, the key question is, do you have the best expert in the market to tackle with the risk, but also to source the right deals? And you still can attract capital, whether debt or equity. What about tax equity? I imagine some of the larger mature assets, they already have their tax equity in place, whereas newer technologies perhaps aren't large or far enough along yet to attract that kind of attention. Is there a differentiation that you can explain for us between mature and new technologies when it comes to tax equity? Well, it's a good point. Tax equity, first, is very specific, for example, for the US market. We don't see that much of that in Europe. But it's always been, I would say, a challenge, and there is a scarce product under tax equity, but it will become even more true under current environments. And again, if you are an equity and tax equity investor, you will, and you can choose, you will go for the more mature assets with lower risks, for sure. That pretty much gets through a lot of what I wanted to ask you. I wonder, is there anything else that I should be asking you? What would you say to the audience today? What is fascinating is that we are entering a new world because nobody would have anticipated the price of energy today, the price of hydrocarbon increasing, coal plants turn on again in Europe, and there will be a before and an after of the current crisis. So we have, nobody has anticipated also that Europe will have to plan a drastic reduction on consumption from their industry, so cutting the production of their industry to be able to face supplies, the need for gas supply. So the world will be different in the sense that cost matters in terms of energy, but I think which are much more important than that is the security of supply. And also, as the success of our Clean Hydrogen Fund shows, decarbonization of the economy is still a very strong driver in the energy market and the economy as a whole. So I think for people like us, we are entering a new era and investors and GPs will have to have different capabilities that they had in the past if they want to be really taking advantage of the market and mitigating the risk, which are very different than they were maybe three or two or three years ago. So that's all the questions that I have for you today. I want to thank you again for joining us and thank everyone for listening. Our topic has been new versus mature technologies in the U.S. renewables market from the perspective of European capital. Our guest was Matthias Burghardt, head of Ardian Infrastructure. My name is Onofrio Castilla for InfraLogic and please join us next time.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter and news editor for Information News' North American Coverage. I'll be your host today. So it gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today. Someone's going to give us a close look at Digital Bridge Group's credit team and strategy. I have with me Managing Director Chris Moon. Hi, Chris. So I figured just to get the conversation started, let's do something a little bit easy. If you could, for our audience, go over Digital Bridge's credit team strategy and a little bit of a history. Yeah, sure. So we started the group at the end of 2019, middle of 2020, we pulled the team together. And really, the core thesis was that there was opportunity in the digital infrastructure market to provide growth capital that we felt the market hadn't really been addressing. We've spent some time looking at just broadly some of the growth economy sectors like digital infrastructure. And from an investor perspective, they're very underweighted in exposure to those types of companies. So you can go on our website, we have two white papers where we lay this out in detail. But really, the idea was to get investors more exposure to a very fast growing and dynamic sector. And we felt with the heritage at Digital Bridge of very strong operator level, diligence abilities and the ability to really specialize in the sector that it would really be something that we'd be able to find a lot of good opportunities to address and so far we have. So it's been very, very good so far. Great. Tell me this, where does Digital Bridge like to target and play in the company's debt stack? I think when we started this, we thought there would be... For the yield targets that we're looking for and what our investors have in mind that most of the opportunities would come in the form of junior capital. So second lien loans, holdco notes, preferred equity, those types of instruments. I think what we found is there's a lot of opportunity also for first dollar senior secured loans. And if you look at our portfolio today, we have a pretty substantial amount of deals that we've done in first dollar senior secured. So I would say just broadly, it kind of ranges. And I think from a product perspective, we focus a lot on funding growth CapEx, whether that's in the form of term loans or construction loans or other types of junior securities. But I think because we're so narrowly focused in this sector, our mandate around product is quite broad. So you'll see us play in a variety of places in the cap stack. So what subsectors of digital info are you guys most bullish about and why? So we cover the same four core areas that our equity fund has traditionally covered. So towers, small cells, data centers, and fiber. I would say the credit strategy has probably the broadest mandate in terms of being able to look at other operating intensive businesses that sit around the edges of those types of businesses. And if I look at our pipeline right now, there's a lot to do in fiber, both residential and enterprise. We have a fair amount of activity right now in the data center industry. And that's obviously a space we've all spent a long time and there's some really good opportunities there. Some of the more nascent areas like IoT and edge computing, we really have our eye on those types of opportunities and as they materialize and some of those businesses get to more scale, I think that will be an area that we'll be very active in. The fiber part, do you guys just look at enterprise fiber that come with the long-term contracts that come with it? Or would you guys dip your toes in the waters of residential, which lacks those long-term contracts? Yeah. We would do residential. We've looked at a number of opportunities both in the US and in Europe. I think there's absolutely a room for creative financing structures to fund some of those businesses. And I think what we found in Europe in particular is that there's a lot of dislocation between what the banks will do and where you're able to raise equity to pursue those types of projects. So we think there's a lot of good opportunity there for creative financing capital to help build those businesses. Gotcha. Thanks for that. A couple of months ago, we saw DigitalBridge credit team participate in EverStream Solutions ReFi. I'm just wondering as a sample for our audience here, what exactly about EverStream's funding? What fundamentals made it a compelling case to lend to? Yeah. So EverStream's a great business. It's primarily an enterprise fiber network that spans throughout the Midwest. It's got a really, really good management team, one that we've known for a very long time. They have two main parts of the business. There's the traditional enterprise fiber, and they also have a substantial amount of fiber to the tower where they sign long-term contracts with carriers to provide service to cell towers. Both of those businesses, we like a lot. There's long-term contracted revenue. There's a long history of good execution by the team. And it was really just a perfect opportunity for us to express that in a form of a little bit more leverage than they had traditionally been able to get from the bank market. And we put together a structure that has really not been used before in the telecom industry to be able to achieve some of that. And so it was a great result for the sponsor, for the company, one of the biggest deals we did last year. Gotcha. Is it possible if you could share an outlook on EverStream, just what your thoughts are going forward? Sure. I mean, it has a lot of long-term contracted revenue, so there's a lot of visibility to the business. Those two main business lines that I mentioned are both very dynamic growth prospects. And so we would expect to see them to continue to build network, expand the customer footprint, do a lot of the things the team's been doing for a really long time. And I think they've got a tremendous runway to be able to do that. Great. Thanks for that. So yesterday, I don't know if you saw this or not, the Journal ran a story. This year through May, leveraged loans is down 21% from same period last year. And junk bonds, that volume has fallen by 68% over the same amount of time. Private equity is turning to direct lenders as leveraged loans dry up, to use their language. I'm just kind of curious, we see this run up in equities as well. What kind of opportunities has this created for you guys when you see something like that? So this has been happening for a long time. It's not just the most recent pullback, although that certainly exacerbates the trend. And I think what, particularly in this industry, what has been very apparent to us is that the level of diligence and specialization that you can bring to a financing package the way you can in a private credit format is very, very much desired by a lot of these businesses. The ability to move quickly, have a lot of transparency in what you can and can't do, have a very streamlined and easy process to move through approvals. That's really key when you have businesses that are as dynamic as they are in this industry. So there's a lot of need for growth cutbacks, and these businesses are constantly consuming capital. And so what we've historically seen is the syndicated loan market, particularly driven by the rating agency's view of these businesses, has always been dislocated from, I think, the way that borrowers view their own businesses, and certainly the way that we think about these companies. And so that really provides an opportunity. And I think what we've learned, besides this sort of ratings arbitrage, is that the borrowers really like to have specialists in their debt stack, and that really actually means a lot to them. And then if you can use that to validate the business or validate the capital, that really is sort of an added benefit that you get with a lot of these private credit businesses. One question I would like to ask, especially on the data center side, we see some companies, newer ones who have just come into the market, and I can even see this for fiber of the home operators who are relatively new, maybe a year or two old, maybe three years old, coming into the market because of the market structure and opportunities that come with that, seeing them carrying no debt in some instances. I think the concern there is CEOs, sometimes they think of themselves as software company entrepreneurs or something along those lines, and they don't want to be hamstrung by carrying large debt loads and the covenants that come with that. So let's say if you're talking to one of those executives, how would you lay their concerns? How would you keep terms flexible enough for an operator so it can still see growth without having to worry about following covenants? Yeah, I guess maybe I'd put a different spin on that. I mean, I think in the examples where I've seen what you're describing, I think typically that's a business that the markets looked at, particularly the banks have looked at and said it's not financeable, and it's been hard to try to bring in debt capital. A lot of the transactions that we look at have very sophisticated investors behind them, often specialty sponsors that focus on the space. All of them broadly like to use a responsible amount of leverage to get the right optimization on returns. So I don't really find myself in a situation that often where I'm trying to convince an executive that they should be utilizing leverage to fund their growth. I do think that your second point around how do you keep a structure flexible enough so that they can grow and not be overburdened by debt, I think in any structure, you've got to have some controls around what they can and can't do. And obviously, you need to be able to responsibly manage your position in the credit. But I think there's ways in which we've utilized where we can sit down at the beginning with an entrepreneur and say, where are your concerns and where do you see pain points within a structure or where do you see issues that you'd like us to structure around? And everything we do is basically drawn up from day one as kind of a bespoke structure. So there's often not many things that we can't find a way to structure around and make sure there are appropriate controls elsewhere in the transaction so that we can get ourselves and our investors comfortable. But it really has to be... And that's the approach that we always take is it really has to be sort of a partnership approach where from the very beginning, you're committed to getting the best and most efficient capital to the business. And then we kind of work hand in glove to figure out what you need and what we need to make that work. What can you possibly share with us in terms of where we can expect the DigitalBridge credit team next in terms of deals? If you think... Just backing up a little bit to when we talked about the history of the team and the strategy, the heritage of DigitalBridge has always been entrepreneurship and innovation. And we've constantly innovated on the financing markets over and over, and that's been led by the debt capital markets team on the equity side. And there's been a lot of value that's created in being a leader in how you finance these businesses. So that's really the same sort of heritage that we try to embody here on the credit side, where if you look at the EverStream transaction, for example, that was a brand new application of that structure. It hadn't been done before on an unrated billion-dollar debt issuance. Very innovative and first of its kind. I think you'll see us continue to start from the operator's perspective, the borrower's perspective, and try to solve pain points in a very creative way and create new technology in financing structures. And I think the next deal or two that you'll see from us will continue to have those types of hallmarks, where it'll be a first of its kind or it'll be an innovative structure that the market hasn't seen before. And I think, you know, there's going to be a lot more to come on that. Something I see this, we've seen a lot of reporting from my peers and other publications and on TV talking about various macroeconomic trends and potential headwinds. What keeps you up at night? What makes you worry the most? You know, in some ways, it's a better environment for credit than when we started this. When we first launched, you know, the team, it was right before the pandemic. The market was very, you know, hot for credit. There was this very brief moment in time in March of April of 2020, where the markets were way off. We really weren't yet in a position to capitalize on that. We were just forming the team and bringing the platform together. And then it just grinded higher and higher and higher, really, until just a few months ago. And frankly, what we faced last year, in some ways, was a tougher environment for credit than what we have in front of us. And so I think, you know, obviously, you know, interest rates are, you know, all of our borrowers are very sensitive to that. You know, how much of the rising interest, you know, cost can we pass on to borrowers versus, you know, are we absorbing, you know, that's a big topic, you know, inflation and supply chain issues in a lot of the businesses that we focus on, you know, have real impact. And so, you know, we're really starting to see that, you know, broadly across the sector start to, you know, have more and more of significant impact. You know, I think just if we step back, this sector has, you know, some tremendous tailwinds and growth prospects. So while there's a lot of things that are happening in the macro environment, digital infrastructure historically is not, you know, perfectly correlated to that. And it's, you know, it's typically grown, you know, throughout those types of down cycles. So that's why we feel really good about, you know, having the, you know, the product together and the team ready to go. And you know, I think it's actually going to be a very, you know, good environment to bring creative financing solutions to some of these businesses that, you know, might be facing maybe a little bit, you know, more distress than, you know, we've seen in the past. Got it. Great. Thank you for that, Chris. That pretty much wraps up my line of questioning. I appreciate the time you've taken for me and my audience. Thank you very much. So folks, that was Chris Moon from Digital Bridge. Want to thank you for listening to this podcast. Don't forget to like, subscribe and share the podcast. So that's it for this week. Don't forget to tune in next time. Until then, take care.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2022-04-13 20:57:53+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### What’s Jair Bolsonaro legacy for the Brazilian infrastructure market?\n**Episode ID:** 4360\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Crossroads podcast. I am Gabriela Valente, reporter for InfraLogic in Brazil. And in this episode, we'll discuss the political scenario surrounding the Brazilian infrastructure market. We'll be joined by Massami Uyeda, Jr., partner of the law firm Arapinichi Uyeda. Massami is an experienced lawyer with a strong background in infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector. Massami, thank you for joining us. Thank you. Brazil has been a fertile field for concessions and projects under President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. He got elected in 2018. And his first term is coming to an end as Brazil will have presidential elections in October. So, Massami, despite the political controversies the president himself and his allies, Bolsonaro began his administration with a lot of optimism and high expectations for private investments in infrastructure. Many projects were tendered and the changes in regulation also boosted investment expectations. Terceira Freitas was widely praised by the market for his work as minister of infrastructure. And he's also taken advantage of this to run for the government of Sao Paulo this year. So, looking back, what would you say is the legacy of Bolsonaro's administration for the infrastructure market? Gabriela, thank you. So, in Brazil, the infrastructure projects like toll roads, airports, port terminals, sanitation, water treatment, mass transit, they are transferred to the private sector through PPP or public concession scheme. And what the Bolsonaro government did in the last three and a half years was a continuation of what his predecessor did, the former president Temer, and what happened in Brazil in the last 20 years. In the last 20 years in Brazil, most of these public utilities or infrastructure projects were handed to the private sector. So, one of the big merits of Bolsonaro's government is to continue what has been done in the last 20 years. That's what happened in these Bolsonaro terms. It's interesting because he inherited a lot of the policy design from his predecessors. So, can we describe how much he did himself? What is a merit of his team we can really attribute to him? Yeah, you're right. Most of the successful infrastructure and concession projects that were auctioned during the Bolsonaro's term, the last three and a half years, they were projects that were conceived and designed by the president Michel Temer. So, he's inherited all of this project. But if I can say if he has a merit, yes, he has a merit to have in the Ministry of Economy a special division, a department, what they call PPI, where they have good and excellent and competent people, a team of professionals that did an excellent job during these last three or four years to interact with the private sector and potential investors to understand what was the concern of these investors and private sector at all regarding project risk allocation, concessionary duties, terms of the concession. So, all the technical aspects were discussed on an open discussion between government and the private sector. That's his merit. Interesting. So, Frica's work leading this team and how would you say he managed to shield the Ministry of Infrastructure and the PPI from political controversies such as acquisitions of corruption and dismantling of environmental policies? Again, it's important to mention that the PPI division, the PPI department is from the Ministry of Economy, not from the infrastructure. So, Frica at the end had nothing to do with the modeling of the concession projects. He just implemented or just prepared the beat process. But the conception of the project was done by the Ministry of Economy. As regarding the corruptions and all these accusations, I would say that after the Lava Jato investigation that happened five, six years ago, there was a little improvement in Brazil regarding corruption schemes. But I wouldn't say that we are free of corruption. I think, unfortunately, that we still have some corruption cases here and there. Most of them are still under investigation, with less exposure in the press and in the media. But the investigations are happening. They are ongoing. Yeah, they are ongoing. And you asked about the environmental issues. Again, the Minister Freitas, which is the former Minister of Infrastructure, he was not responsible for the environmental regulation, because this is under the responsibility of the environmental ministry. So, what Freitas did was just to comply with the requirements and get the prior license before the works start being done, being performed. Yeah, I see. But he was responsible for the relationship with investors, I mean, doing the roadshows and presenting all the projects to those investors. Also, there was a high expectation for the entry of new international investors into Brazilian projects. In your perception, this objective was achieved? Yeah, you're right. Freitas did a lot of roadshows, international roadshows, trying to attract the attention of international competitors, international investors. But unfortunately, no, he did not succeed in his goals. We just had access to a recent survey that shows that between 2020 and 2021, there were like 65 public auctions for different types of infrastructure, roads, airports, port terminals, public lighting and others. And from these 65 auctions, only 17 had received proposals from non-Brazilian investors. So, less than one third, there was participation, there were participation of international investors. And only one or two, I'm not sure, was foreign investors won this auction. So, the rate is very, very low. There was some competition among locals and only the nationals participated. And of course, some of these local participants, they have some kind of foreign investment in their capital structure. But being a Brazilian company for foreign investment, we consider this as a local player, not a straight direct investment from international investors. I see. And what would you think that has prevented the entry of new non-Brazilian investors? I think what happened in the last couple of years, we had a pandemic, we have all these macroeconomic uncertainties, we have all the situations. So, I think that Brazil was not attracted enough to receive the attention. Mainly, what is happening is the lack of competition in Brazil. So, the market is open, few players are bidding. And again, these macroeconomic uncertainties, I think, drive the decision right now. When you say macroeconomic issues, are you talking about the fiscal balance, the indicators of the GIP regarding the growth of the country's economy? That's right. You're right. So, we have in Brazil a very unstable macroeconomic situation, we have high inflation rates, we have high interest rate rates, we have this fiscal budget deficit, a very, very shy GDP growth predictions. So, these macroeconomics in Brazil, for the next mandate, maybe, if we are lucky, we have to fix all of this again. And at the international level, also the macroeconomics are really uncertain right now, even in terms of inflation in most of the countries and economies. So, there is certain instability in terms of economics. Right now, as the elections are approaching, what would you say is the mood of the investors and their appetite for concessions and privatizations? Yeah, we will have next October major elections in the federal and state levels. So, I believe that from now until the end of the year, there will be a kind of reduction in the offer of projects to the market. So, there will be few projects to go to the market. And this is from this public perspective. From the private sector, from the private investors, I think the mood will be the same. They are waiting what's going to happen with the elections. And more than this, what would be the prediction for the macroeconomics of the country? That's what drives the attention right now. And in terms of the projects that were supposed to be auctioned in 2022, we have seen some delays in in-project concession projects, but the privatizations auctions are moving forward. So, what can we expect that will be completed in 2022, and what will be left for the next or the second term of Jair Bolsonaro? I think that, as I said, from now until the end of the year, the offer of projects will be reduced. Maybe we will have federal airports, the seventh round of federal airports that will bring another 15 airports to the market. This will probably be auctioned by mid-year. And there is a big privatization that would be next, which is the electro-gas systems. Electro-gas is the electricity company of the federal government. It's a huge company. And this privatization has been going on since day one of Bolsonaro's government. And there is a small chance to be privatized until the end of the year. Out of these two or three projects, I don't see anything relevant going to the market. Is there any project that we were expecting to be auctioned in 2022 that will not be concluded, and it's a frustration we will miss this auction? Yeah, I think the electro-gas privatization is already a frustration because, as I said, it was discussed and studied since day one of Bolsonaro's government. It took more than three and a half years, and it's still pending discussion with the legislative powers. Regarding the next Brazilian president, what would you say will be the mission of the new president, or if we have a second term of Bolsonaro? I think that the new president of Brazil will find that it comes with big economic challenges, as I said. High inflation, high interest rate, a big federal budget deficit, a very small GDP growth. And on top of that, the new president will need to approve reforms in the legislative, in the Congress, just like tax reform, administrative reform. Those are key reforms that will help to reduce the budget deficit. This is the macroeconomic challenge. For the infrastructure sector, I think Brazil, the Brazilian infrastructure market is open for potential interest and competitors. With very, very low competition, we are seeing very low competition, and we still have very good projects and opportunities. Brazil is a large country. We have strong demand, plus 210 million people, and we have a huge need for basic infrastructure. As an example, water distribution and sewage treatment. This is a huge need for Brazil. So what we need is in the next presidency, we need to get back to the international interest rate. We need to get their attention. And this should be the first concern of the new president. Bring back the good competition to the market. We are missing this competition. To make this competition come again, what would you say is the path? I think the new president should at least demonstrate that he has or she has conditions to fix the macroeconomics in the first years of the mandate. So this would be a very good sign to the market. Right now, what the market is missing is good sign, good predictions. That's what we feel when we discuss with our clients and potential investors. So I think that's it. Masami, thank you very much for joining us in Crossroads Podcast. No, thank you. Thank you very much. It was a pleasure. Bye.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2022-04-08 16:52:19+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Combining Corporate Equity and Infrastructure Investment in Growth-Stage Companies\n**Episode ID:** 4359\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello, thank you for joining us. My name is Onofrio Castilla, a reporter for Sparkspread. I'm being joined by Ben Baker from Greenbacker Capital. Ben, thanks for being on the show today. Thanks a lot for having me. Great. I want to start off just by acknowledging that Greenbacker has been very active lately. For those who are paying attention, it seems like every week there's multiple announcements, equity investments in companies, as well as acquisition of assets across a range of classes. Can we start the conversation with a little bit about you and the fund from which you're investing? Sure. Myself, I joined Greenbacker about two years ago to launch a private equity slash growth equity investing strategy for the firm. Historically, over the past 11 years or so in the firm's existence, the firm's been investing out of an open-ended sustainable infrastructure fund. When you're seeing press releases regarding acquiring a solar farm or repowering a wind farm, that's coming out of the infrastructure fund, which is a separate vehicle and the much larger one of the two. We call it the flagship fund. It's about $1.6 billion or so right now. I got here in a pretty roundabout way, as I think a lot of folks in the industry have over the past 10, 15 years. I've been in the power or infrastructure space in one way, shape, or form for about the past 15 years, starting when it was mainly gas and coal plants and then over time, evolving towards renewables, solar and otherwise. I have been a bit on the investing side, firms like GE in their energy investing business and I've also been on the development side and been on the front lines. I bring both of those experiences or both of those mentalities to bear in our work here. Great. Recently, Greenbacker has made some equity investments. I'm thinking about Noria Energy in solar. I'm thinking about DeLorean Power in storage. Moving forward, particularly as it relates to equity investments in growth companies, what is Greenbacker's strategy? What should we expect? Sure. Yeah. I think our strategy, it's rapidly evolving, just as the market is. When it comes to asset classes and the types of technologies we touch, first of all, our mandate is written pretty broadly. You've seen that we've invested in solar companies. We've invested in hydro companies, battery storage companies. We're looking at waste to value and EV charging. We're looking across a pretty wide range of what could be called sustainable infrastructure. I think the risks in the industry are changing so quickly that I think we face different risks today than we were writing about when we first were writing the PPM on the fund. Back then, we were thinking a lot about development risks and about revenue models and about market share. But I think what we've seen over the past year and a half on the supply chain side, the cost side, the labor side, the interconnection queue side, I think these are new risks. Or at least risks that have become exacerbated even since we started the fund. So I think that'll continue to drive the themes into which we invest. When it comes to the kinds of businesses we invest in, that won't change. We partner with really experienced and really exciting management teams. We look for teams that have a differentiated approach to what they're doing and have really gained attraction in some niche, whether that's geographic, technological, the kind of client that they're approaching in a given technology. So that's what you'll see. You look at Noria. These guys are one of the foremost experts in the US on floating solar. That's pretty niche today. But we take the view that that'll grow significantly. And then DeLorean, one of our most recent investments too. The way that they're approaching the battery storage space is very differentiated insofar as their work with municipal and cooperative utilities and the way in which they set up their revenue structures. I want to put a pin in risk and come back to that. But first, for the sake of continuity, I want to talk about something that we'd spoken about earlier and that's combining or bridging growth capital and infrastructure capital. Can you describe that concept to the listeners and what you meant by that? Yes. It's a funny thing. I think we've been discovering ourselves and part of that, we go out to the market with a product. And over the last year and a half, the market has really shown us what is most missing, what companies are looking for, what can serve them the best. And what we've come to see is that there's a number of either young companies or companies that are hitting an inflection point in their growth. And these companies are obviously involved in sustainable infrastructure. And they need two forms of advice and capital. On the one hand, there's the growth equity. We are oftentimes investing into businesses that are a couple of years old, from the two guys in a truck thing to a business that maybe has eight people or 12 people, but is on the cusp of real exponential growth in their pipeline and their staff. So on the one hand, we're coming in and helping set up everything from IT policies and cash management policies to ESG policies to incentive plans and bonus plans for key employees and really getting the company at the top, set up for success and really ready to grow and scale. But at the same time, what the company is also looking for is both infrastructure capital, as well as the technical know-how when it comes to developing, owning, operating projects. And I think what we found is that oftentimes, it's really hard to find both of those tailored forms of capital and advice in one place. And that if you look for one of them, you're going to get shortchanged on the other. And so we try to separate out the approach, but put our growth equity hats on in GDev, but then work with companies to help them arrange the infrastructure capital that they need separately from that, whether that's from our affiliated fund or whether that's from a different market participant. You guys closed out a new fund very recently. It was oversubscribed and you announced a new slate of LPs along with that. Did you have to describe this concept to them? What kind of concerns did they bring when they heard you pitch this concept to them or explain your strategy? Yeah. Thinking back, I think there's a number of concerns or at least considerations as a growth stage company is on the precipice of developing and perhaps building and owning a large portfolio of assets. And oftentimes, we are there for the first financing that a company closes, the first COD on an asset that they've built and flip on. So for sure, being there for all these firsts poses a risk, which we think we look for a commensurate return on that risk. But it's really about the DNA of this organization and why if someone's going to take that risk, why it should be us. Because having built up the infrastructure fund over the past decade, we've also created a portfolio of multiple gigawatts of solar and wind and battery storage facilities across hundreds of facilities. We have at least 40 folks, I think, who sit in Vermont and elsewhere who are focused on diligence, procurement, engineering, construction management, operations, and data management, and all that stuff. So we are in a great position to leverage the other pieces of the firm to bring all that to bear from both the capital and expertise perspective to the companies that we are funding as a growth equity investor. To touch on your place in the investment chain, do you see yourself as just being a step above a VC? Is this strategy just one rung on a company's climb to an eventual large exit or IPO? Let's... To respond to that, I guess, there's a lot of similarities to some chain in the VC funding parlance into series A's and B's and C's. I think what we've seen that's very different and where I think VCs take a different approach is the portfolio theory or the statistics around seed or early stage investing and how many investments will move forward, how many won't, how many will be home runs, how many will be zeros. And you can take different risks, I think, when you're constructing a portfolio in that way. So I think one major difference is that we have zero tolerance for zeros here. We are not investing in a large basket of companies on the premise that not all will succeed. We're investing only in companies that we do expect to succeed. And we work that hard with our companies because that's how... That's our mentality. And I think the other thing too is, I think there's a really important place for venture capital in the industry, especially as it pertains to technology risk and software and opening up new markets and new tech, or even into the manufacturing side of what it is that we do. I think for us, we take development risk, and we take the risk of building up companies and hiring good people and getting into interconnection queues. And we take risk around the future value of assets, which could be affected by interest rates, commodity prices, other input prices, labor, and all that stuff. But we don't take technology risk. And we're not investing in underlying asset classes that really seem to be exotic. We invest in stuff that when it finally reaches NTP, should be pretty boring. So I think that's a pretty big difference. Now, having said that, we're definitely here as bridge capital. And what we think that bridge is, is we want to partner with a company when they have sort of proven the first stage of their success, proven that there's a market that is profitable, and proven that they have a strong position within that market. But what we're trying to do is bridge these companies to being at institutional scale, to being the targets of the M&A processes that you read about over the course of working with them for a few years. What are some of the transactions you've taken note of recently that instruct how you might exit in the future, staying on the topic of equity investments in companies? Sure. So without using names, I think we could talk about the types of transactions that we've seen and the way we've seen the market look at developers and development. We've certainly seen the market re-approach the development phase in the more risky phase of assets, right? And I think part of that's been the clamoring for the underlying assets themselves. And the competition for those assets has forced people to look farther and farther earlier into the development cycle. And the logical extreme of that is obviously to invest in the company that is coming up with these projects in the first place. So through 2021, we saw a pretty aggressive wave of M&A, especially on the much larger side. And what we've seen since then is that as all of the biggest companies, Cypress Creek, Pivot, Dimension, as those companies have been backed, the M&A market has moved down farther and farther down into the middle market, I would say. And so all the while, we've seen the risks that I talked about in the beginning, the rising prices, inflation, conflict in Ukraine, interest rates, interconnection queues, all these risks are, I think, considerations for acquirers. But I think the market in general, and recently, the discussion of more tariffs, if you can believe it. And so I think all of these risks are taken into consideration. But I think a really interesting point that most folks would tend to agree with is that these headwinds are pretty near-term. The market sees very strong fundamentals and a secular direction over the medium and long term. So I think investors who are starting to partner with earlier stage companies, earlier stage pipelines, are going to see those projects come to fruition as a lot of the supply chain and other issues are starting to ease. So I think while you see a moderation in how aggressive folks are going to be in these processes, it doesn't change how excited the market is for the opportunity to invest into a really good development company that has a proven track record of originating assets year after year and getting them permitted and bringing them to NTP. And so in a very long way of saying, I think that what we've seen in 2021 and into 2022 will continue in a more responsible way over the next few years as well. Kind of in the period during which we are bringing a lot of our companies to market. And I think we're already having certain companies get approached unsolicited. So I think that's starting to illustrate how the M&A market, as it goes from big to small, is starting to get farther down into the scale of transaction that we work with. Preston Pyshenov Everything that we've been talking about so far, this kind of overarching investment theory and practice, does it differ across asset classes? We've seen you buy solar and hydroelectric, as you mentioned at the beginning of the discussion, you're increasingly in batteries and looking at EV deals. How does your approach change between them or does it at all? David Tenenbaum Yeah, it's funny. We try, obviously, to create structures that we can rinse repeat with. And that's both when we do corporate investments as well as when we put together an asset level investment fund with an infrastructure investor. So we try to make these pretty adaptable across asset classes. And so we've done one in solar, we've looked at it in hydro, we're working on it in battery storage, we're working on it, looking at it in EVs. And fundamentally speaking, this can be adapted across asset classes. I think, as you get into the details, the less you know about the asset class, or at least the more uncertainty that there could be over the next few years in outcomes, the more bells and whistles you might need to manage some of that uncertainty. But fundamentally, the structures don't have to change across asset classes. Adam Backman You know, when it comes to solar, this is certainly relevant to EVs and batteries. I spoke to an investor today who called it like the seven icebergs. He had like seven different things that are disrupting the industry, supply chain issues, inflation, rate hikes. One big one is the US Department of Commerce investigation in Southeast Asia that could put retroactive tariffs on projects dating back to November. How are all these impacting your investment approach? You know, everything that's just going on lately? Chris Yeah, you know, I think thematically, we've been cognizant of a lot of these risks, or at least the broad categories of the risks. And our investments tend to reflect that, right? So if you look at a partnership that we created with Commonwealth Energy Partners, almost a year ago, you know, last summer, this developer is totally focused on the Virginia market right now. And that means, you know, some, some smaller projects, you know, under 25 megawatts and plenty of bigger stuff that has to go through the PJM process. So at that time, you know, we could already sense, you know, plenty of backlog in the PJM and in the interconnection queues, you know, in Virginia. But you know, we think about the horizon of that backlog. And we think about the horizon of our investments and where the company is and originating those opportunities. And when you start to, even with PJM's interconnection reform, you know, we have attractive projects that are going to be, you know, getting studied, you know, kind of in the middle of this decade, which is generally in line with when we'd expect to have been moving those projects forward. So when we think about project, you know, underlying asset classes that are exposed to, you know, say the interconnection queues, we line up the years and the timing and think about if it makes sense, which, which in this case, it did notwithstanding the near the nearer term headwinds, right, which are not really, you know, affecting us too badly as we as we go around creating an early stage pipeline of over a gigawatt. So that company is doing great, because the timing lines up well. And then if you look at some of our more recent investments, or some of the investments we're looking at today, you know, we certainly have a big focus on on behind the meter, you know, Noria was an example of that, you know, even if some of their projects are 20 megawatts, they're 20 megawatt projects behind the meter with an industrial company. And, you know, our thought, our thought with that is, well, okay, if if we are going to be exposed to all sorts of icebergs, like you said, including the costs of inputs and labor and whatnot, if we can eliminate one of those key risks, you know, IE, the the interconnection queues, well, then that's great, you know, so that's how we were thinking about it there. And going forward, I think, you know, we, we are putting together a broad, or a kind of diversified portfolio of different technologies, like I said, and so, you know, I think that diversification, you know, hydro is not is not exposed to the same risks, solar is, batteries are exposed to similar risks, but not not all the same and not with the same players and not in the same way. And so while there's plenty of correlation within the portfolio, you know, if we're investing across multiple technologies, you know, I think that that creates a decent kind of portfolio construction for us. To keep on this topic, I wonder how it's impacting your existing portfolio companies. I mean, earlier, I mentioned Noria and DeLorean, there's OIA Solar, these equity investments that you've made, what have you experienced with them lately regarding these risks, all these macroeconomic events? And what are you looking for in in future investment? How is that informing your investment theory with with equity investments that have yet to be made? Yeah, I mean, taking it one step at a time, you know, thinking about a company that would be, you know, dealing with some of the near term, you know, impacts of these risks, you know, take OIA, like you mentioned, OIA Solar, they are, you know, advancing 100s of megawatts of pipeline, both in New York, and then and then in other key markets throughout the US. And what's interesting is that for all the risks, all the headwinds, there's kind of equally offsetting opportunities, right? You know, as one example, so for sure, input costs are going up. And for that, I think the company will, you know, this year, they'll build their most economically efficient projects, but maybe defer some projects to 2023 or 2024 to pick up some of that value back as module prices and other prices start to moderate. But at the same time, other companies that have that have had to do the same thing that are that are less well capitalized, they are starting to, to capitulate, you know, pretty, pretty frequently on assets, right? If you had, you know, a few 100k in an asset in a solar farm that you expected to either sell in 2022, or, or finance in 2022, and recoup your spend, you know, from a bank, and now you can't do that, because you're deferring the project, you might have a working capital or liquidity crunch. And so when you look at a bigger developer, like OIA, you know, we've arranged $35 million of capital for them, it actually creates a decent opportunity to to gain market share, right. And then at the same time, you have the governor of New York, over the last few months, expanding the DG goal in New York from six gigawatts to 10 gigawatts. So it's the same theme of, you know, near term headwinds, sort of contradicted by increasingly aggressive goals, and a pretty bright outlook over the medium and long term. So I think, for them, it's created, you know, certain opportunities, right. And then at the same time, the Ohio community solar market, you know, started to open up and, and they entered that market. So they've been able to take some of the time that they might have otherwise spent negotiating EPC contracts this year, and put that towards expanding the pipeline that they'll be building in 2324 25. And, you know, given the kind of the nature of the investments that we make, and the horizons over which we invest, like, to me, that's a positive, you know, I feel like I could just ask you questions all day. But you know, we're running out of time here. So being cognizant of your time, I guess I just open up the floor to you. Like, what else would you care to point out here? What should I be asking you? No, I mean, most most folks ask the what keeps you up at night question? What keeps you up at night, Ben? After going through the interconnection queues, labor costs, prevailing wage, cost of steel modules, tariffs, Ukraine, I feel like we don't really necessarily have to add any more boogeyman into that into that story. Yeah, that's enough. You know, you know, I think what's, what doesn't keep me up. But what's interesting is that a lot of the conversation has shifted back, you know, towards like the, you know, all of the above approach and kind of the need for, you know, certain fossil fuels faster and sooner. And in general, I think that will be a constructive, like recasting of the conversation, because I think the worst thing that can happen is to exclude some of those companies from this conversation when they're, you know, especially the majors, right, but even even some of the smaller companies are really well capitalized, and should really play a big role in the energy transition, which is kind of like the fun part of seeing Houston reinvigorate itself as an energy transition capital is, is emblematic of the fact that, you know, you know, oil and gas companies need to be part of this conversation. And by kind of going back to an all of the above approach, to some extent, at least will create a bit more cooperation, I think, or at least or has the chance to. So, you know, I find that interesting, at least. Ben, thank you so much for joining us today. Thanks for having me. Thank you all for listening to the podcast.

My name is Robin Ganguly, and I'm responsible for all InfoLogic content in the Asia-Pacific region. Now, today, let's start with some numbers. A whopping $923 billion worth of infrastructure, power, and energy and renewables deals closed in 2021, according to the InfoLogic league tables published last month. Now, that's compared with $743 billion in 2019, before the pandemic. In Asia, the figure was $80 billion across sectors. The share of renewables surged from 20% in 2019 to a jaw-dropping 42% in 2021. Now, today, we have an expert in the field to decipher what is happening. Charlie Reid is Managing Director of APAC Renewable Power at BlackRock. He is responsible for leading investment and portfolio management activities across the region, as well as sourcing, executing, and managing renewable infrastructure assets. Now, Charlie established a renewable income platform, which now manages more than $2.2 billion of capital. Charlie, a very, very warm welcome to Crossroads. Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you, Charlie. Now, as I say in good financial reporting, the numbers tell the story, and we saw that in my rather long introduction. Putting you a little bit on the spot right at the start, could you point us to the most attractive renewable segments in Asia and where they are located? Sure. So, you provide some compelling statistics, and I'll give you one in return, which is the road to net zero between now and 2050 will create over $100 trillion of investment opportunities globally, and over 50% of that capital will go into the APAC market. So, from a global perspective, we see Asia-Pacific as critical both to the challenge of climate change, but also the investment opportunity that it creates. When we look within APAC as a region, we invest across markets, and we currently have a focus on the Australian, Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese markets, where we see a range of compelling investment opportunities. And in terms of technologies, we have a particular focus at the moment on offshore wind development, on the deployment of solar assets, batteries, but also EV charging. So, there's a range of sectors that we think are particularly interesting and exciting at the moment. Thank you. You have been on several information, InfoLogic, Sparksbird conferences in the last couple of years, and you've always been a proponent of renewables. And obviously, given the numbers that you mentioned, and which I mentioned as well, it's all very popular. Now, which of the above would you say are the top three? And quite importantly, what should be avoided at this point? Sure. So, you mentioned my attendance at recent events, and I've talked often about the Korean market. South Korea has not been in the headlines in recent history in relation to renewables, and for me, it is one of the most critical renewables markets globally. And that is because of government policy. The government has a very clear mandate now to deliver a net zero future, and by 2030, the Korean renewables market will grow from around 20 gigawatts today to 100 gigawatts. That is creating a vast investment opportunity, particularly across offshore wind and solar. And that investment opportunity is backed by 20-year power purchase agreements from KEPCO subsidiaries. So we see it both as an attractive growth market, but also a market which is delivering attractive risk-adjusted return for renewables investors. The second market I'd probably highlight is the market we've been invested in for some time, which is the Taiwanese solar market. Taiwan, Taiwanese renewables, is often mentioned in relation to offshore wind, but solar is actually the majority of the capacity that will be delivered over time. So in terms of the government's 2025 renewables target of over 30 gigawatts, over 20 gigawatts will come from solar. Last year, the government's solar target was met, but we think that this year and next year we'll see significant growth in the solar market in Taiwan. And then finally, I would mention battery storage in Australia. So you may have seen the headlines in relation to certain coal-fired power stations being turned off ahead of schedule, and we see that as adding to a picture in the Australian power market where there is going to be significant volatility, but significant need for battery storage in order to help with the energy transition. So we are actively researching investment opportunities in battery storage in Australia. And then finally, what to avoid, the areas related to the point I just raised that does add incremental risk for investing in renewables, is exposure to merchant electricity pricing, i.e. investing in renewable power projects where the price at which you sell your power is not fixed through a power purchase agreement. Given the volatility around the energy transition, that can create opportunities, but it does create risk, particularly when that risk is combined with debt in the capital structure. I would recommend that as investors look at the markets across APAC, where you do have the ability to access long-term fixed price contracts, those opportunities should be grabbed. I agree entirely. I think PPAs have been quite important, and most investors have insisted on long-term PPAs. Dialing back a little bit, Charlie, just a follow-up question. A bit about Taiwan. I think two years ago, if I'm not wrong, you were one of the first people that I had heard saying Taiwan is more of a solar market rather than an offshore wind market, and it seems to be coming true. But just looking at the offshore wind market now in Taiwan, do you think it's become more of a secondary market now rather than a primary, or would you disagree? I would agree. What we found in offshore wind globally is that cost of capital for high-quality offshore wind assets decreases dramatically once assets reach the start of construction, and we've seen that to be the case in Taiwan. There, as you're aware, a lot of the tariffs have already been awarded. Quite a few projects are in construction, although some of those projects have experienced delays. We do see the opportunity there now being largely secondary market, whereas we are focused more on developing offshore wind platforms like we're doing through our Credo platform in South Korea. Thanks for that. That's quite informative. Now, switching gears a bit, could you tell us a bit about BlackRock's interest in new partnerships or even asset sales? Sure. You may have seen in the press that we've recently disposed of a large portfolio of operational solar projects in Australia, and that gives a good indication of part of our strategy, which is to take assets from development through construction, through the early years of operation, and then to divest them. We are constantly looking for opportunities to bring new partners into our stable, and particularly for the platforms and developers that we have built up across the Asia-Pacific region, we are always looking for good-quality partners on both the equity and the debt side to co-invest with us. As we look out over the next two years, I see that partnerships and strategic partnerships across APAC will make a lot of sense for us as a platform, and we will be looking across the region to develop our network of partners. Now, Charlie, just going back to the previous topic that we were talking about, you said storage in Australia. How big, in your opinion, is the market, and how big is it going to be in, say, a few years' time? The standalone batch storage market in Australia is developing very, very rapidly at the moment, from only a few headline-grabbing projects, such as Elon Musk's big battery a few years ago, now to hundreds of megawatts being announced on a monthly basis. I would anticipate that before too long, we will have market forecasts of around 5 to 10 gigawatts of battery storage capacity across the NEM. And what I would say about the energy transition is that it always happens more rapidly than people expect. So I think we will see very significant battery storage capacity rolled out across the electricity market in Australia before we know it. It's interesting that you dropped Elon Musk in there. I mean, I'm really glad I don't invest in Bitcoin, because it seems to move quite rapidly with what he says, one way or the other. Right, I'll bring in Celine Ge. So she is InfoLogic senior reporter for Greater China. I know Celine has several questions for you. We'll start with one. Celine, please go ahead. Hi, Charlie. I was wondering whether you could elaborate on new asset classes or regions that BlackRock is interested in. Absolutely. So one key thematic for us in terms of asset class is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. We see this as over a trillion dollar investment opportunity globally. And we have moved early into this sector. And you will have seen this through our investment in Ionity in Europe, but also in Jolt in Australia, where we have a pipeline of over 5000 chargers across Australia, but also increasingly international. So I would say that for us across the APAC region, we'll be looking to roll out our investments and our strategy in charging infrastructure at rapid pace and at large scale. And then secondly, in terms of regions, I've referenced so far, key markets for us, such as Australia, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. You may have noted that we recently announced the formation of a new strategy called the Climate Finance Partnership, where we are working together with key government entities, but also key institutional investors to invest in the energy transition in developing markets. And as part of that, we will have a focus on investing in the ASEAN markets within Asia Pacific. And we hope that we'll be announcing our first deals in that region over the coming months. In terms of EV charging, apart from Australia, do you have any other APAC markets that you would set sight on? Yes. So through Jolt, we have agreed our first electric vehicle charging installations to be installed in New Zealand and in our first foray internationally. But we're also taking a close look through our development partners at the Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese markets where it makes sense to leverage our on the ground capabilities and renewables to expand our investment universe into electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Thanks, Charlie. Now, just moving on to green financing, your views on APAC's green energy financing, refinancing conditions and BlackRock's plans. The financing markets in APAC remain very robust with significant, particularly refinancing opportunities available despite the increase in rates that we've been seeing across markets. We announced some time ago that we were planning to refinance our Taiwanese solar portfolio. And that is a process that is underway. So we're getting good firsthand feedback on the debt markets that remain very robust, particularly for green loans. So we're excited about the financing opportunities across the markets where we're investing in terms of upside they can bring for us as equity investors. And I also find it interesting that not once during this interview have you mentioned COVID. So is the main impact of COVID, apart from a few pockets in Asia, is it a thing of the past now as in its effect on financial markets? I wouldn't say it's a thing of the past. What I would say is that we've been able to adjust very quickly to the new COVID world. So we've invested over a billion dollars into climate infrastructure within the Asia-Pacific region. The vast majority of that capital was invested during COVID. Owing to BlackRock's broader network, we've been able to continue to invest and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the energy transition. But that is not to say that COVID is without risk to us. And particularly in relation to the opportunity to travel to the markets that I mentioned, it's still a challenging situation. So we hope that that improves. But we are seeing that sustainable assets, climate infrastructure, and the energy transition have emerged as winners in the post-COVID world. Just before I move on to my final question of the day, we haven't addressed the two massive elephants in the room. We've talked about South Korea, Japan, Australia, but India and China. Absolutely. So the Indian and Chinese renewable markets are clearly key with China representing around a third of global renewables. And these are two increasingly important markets for global renewables going forward. They are markets that we pay close attention to, and we will be paying particular attention to them going forward as we look for market entry opportunities within those markets. Historically, we've been very disciplined about how and when we've entered markets, be they European, US, or APAC markets. And we'll take the same approach when it comes to both India and China. Any hiring plans, Shirley? So we've now built a very strong team across the region. We have eight people between Sydney, Singapore, and Tokyo. And we are looking to add to that team, particularly by bringing people on a junior level to grow them throughout our team. So I'd say we're very happy with the base that we have, but always looking to grow the team and to increase the scale of our presence. Excellent. Now, moving on to policy, are you spotting any trends across your target markets? And if you could also tell us about the advantages and disadvantages between development stage investment versus brownfield M&As in APACs, a two-part question there. First, policy, any trends and M&A brownfield versus greenfield? In terms of renewables policy, the world is having to adjust to the situation where renewables is very low cost and therefore needs little in the way of subsidy. However, to the point that we discussed previously, merchant risk is very significant and can put investors off. And therefore, there is a requirement for long-term policy support and long-term power purchase agreements. And we see this play out, for example, in Australia. So government stepping in to continue to provide long-term power purchase agreements or feed-in tariffs, for me, is vital in terms of underpinning the growth of renewables across the region. And in some markets, we see that as auctioned. In other markets, we don't. So that's the key dynamic and the key gate for growth for renewables. When it comes to stage of investment, we're an active investor and we like to take assets for the journey from the start of their life through to operations. So we are currently focused on investing in development platforms to develop a large-scale portfolio of assets to then bring into the operating phase. Our job is to generate megawatts and megawatt hours. So we are keen to get assets into construction and through to the start of operations. And we will, from time to time, invest in standalone assets at NTP or COD. But the majority of what we do is developing our own assets and taking them through to the operational phase. If you had to mention one takeaway from this interview, BlackRock is a really big player in the market. So, you know, everyone's really interested to know what BlackRock's strategy is, what BlackRock is betting on within the rules of privacy. If you could just elaborate a little bit on that, a takeaway from this interview. So I would say that we are betting very firmly on a net zero future and that the steps that governments will be taking across APAC to deliver that future are real and that it will happen more quickly than people can imagine. So we are, we have very high conviction on renewables and climate infrastructure globally. We have particularly high conviction for renewables and climate infrastructure in the APAC region. All right, with that, we will come to the end of this interview. Charlie, thank you very much for speaking with us and we look forward to hearing more from you both at InfoLogic events and potentially further podcasts in the future. Thank you very much. Pleasure. Thank you very much, Charlie.

I am your host, Andrew Vitale, a senior reporter for Sparkspread. Our guest today is someone who everybody in the renewable sector knows very well, Mona Tajani, who leads the renewable energy team at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Mona has a long background working in renewables. She is a licensed engineer and is really one of the brightest and most knowledgeable people across the renewable space. Mona, thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Andrew. I'm really excited to be on your show. This is very exciting. Well, I'm excited to have you here as a guest and talk about the renewable sector. So I gave I gave our audience a little bit of a rundown of your background. But can you tell me a little bit about your team at Pillsbury and what you're focusing on? Sure. Yeah. So we are a multidisciplinary team. We do everything soup to nuts on renewable energy and clean tech. And that means that, you know, we're doing joint ventures, M&A, financing, tax equity. You know, and then, of course, we have all the ancillary pieces as well, like the regulatory and the real estate and environmental and antitrust and etc. So we're we're soup to nuts, full service firm. And we are focusing on the, you know, the clean energy, renewable energy sector and really, you know, trying to make a difference. My team is all over. I have people that are my colleagues that are with me here in New York. I also have some in California, Texas, London, Japan, all over. So we're international practice. I myself am dual qualified both here in the US as well as in London. And as a result, we have a lot of foreign clients that want to do business here in the United States and abroad. So it's been a really exciting last few years with stellar growth across the renewables industry. Where do you see the most opportunity and the most potential right now looking forward? Yeah, I see three broad trends in our, you know, in the in the renewable energy space that are new for 2022. And I think that they're going to be getting stronger and they will proliferate more. The first trend is that we are definitely seeing this energy transition towards a clean, carbon free world that's largely been increasing our use of renewables and increasing premiums on the use of fossil fuels. And this is a global phenomenon. We're seeing electrification as one of the significant ways to decarbonize energy, whether that is like switching to electric vehicles or solar, wind, et cetera, biofuels. So we're definitely seeing that and clean energy alternatives that can provide a reliable supply of power when supply from renewable sources dips. So that's one of the trends that we see. And I know we'll also, another big trend that we're working on a lot of here in the United States and in Europe and Asia is other clean energy alternatives that have come to fruition. For example, the European Commission has a strategy to develop green hydrogen for use from 2030. And there are other exciting energy alternatives, including, you know, magma power, which uses heated steam produced by magma deep within the earth to generate electricity. And in fact, we worked on a deal in Iceland where they were using magma enhanced geothermal system to generate electricity. So that's really cool. The second trend that we're seeing is in a nutshell, it's all about decentralization. We are transitioning away from our current system of highly centralized energy grids that are run by monopolistic energy providers and more towards distributed energy. In other words, we're seeing more combination of renewable energy and localized microgrids so consumers can generate their own power for their own needs. Whether this is from solar panels or even EVs, we're talking about decentralized energy schemes and that can serve anything from a single building to an entire housing project or even a whole city. This is super exciting for us because it means that individual consumers, organizations and local authorities can take charge of their own energy and portfolio. The last really big trend, macro trend in our space is digitization. And this is all about the use of digital machines, devices and technology to optimize energy production infrastructure and the use. And we have, quote unquote, everything intelligent these days from intelligent coffee machines to intelligent vacuum cleaners. And now we're moving towards energy networks, intelligent energy networks. And this is linked to this trend of digitization is linked to the other two trends that I was just talking about. And this really increases the variety of zero carbon energy sources that will mean our energy networks become more and more complex. We'll see decentralized grids that will need intelligent solutions to monitor and manage fluctuating demands. And these digital tools will help us overcome these challenges and realize a lot of the much needed changes in the energy sector. So, you know, some of these tools are just as an example is AI and predictive analytics. These are used to analyze and predict demand and adjust where power is drawn from on the distributed grids. The other is the Internet of Things, which includes smart home thermostats and commercial building thermostats that can help cut down energy use. Another one is blockchain, which would be useful for creating smart contracts that allow the customers and end users to trace where their energy comes from. And the last is digital twins, which can be used to create a virtual replica of a power plant or even an entire grid, allowing providers to model different scenarios and make better decisions and improve efficiencies. So definitely these are like the three biggest trends that I that I've been seeing within the energy sector. And, you know, if you guys want to, if any of your listeners want to stay on top of these trends and others, we have a newsletter that we put out on a quarterly basis, which talks about these trends and others specifically in the renewable energy space. You mentioned generating power for magma. Is that basically you're tapping into a volcano and using its heat to generate energy? Yeah. Isn't that super? That sounds very dangerous, Mona. Well, it's already been done, so it's all good. You know, it's been done in Iceland and there's others that have have. I mean, we're taking something, we're taking a free resource and basically, you know, turning it into a renewable energy source to power a lot of industrial uses. So it's actually pretty cool. It does sound cool. That's something that's applicable in the United States. I don't know how many active volcanoes we have at the moment. I don't think it's it's the volcanoes is active here in the United States. But this the technology was a geothermal and we do have a lot of geothermal energy here in the U.S. that we could and that we have been and there's projects that we've been taking advantage of. So, yes. Well, that is really fascinating. I have to say, I have not covered any of those projects, but that's a really fascinating and scary technology. Hey, if it's clean and it's carbon free and it's renewable, what's the you know, and it's safe and you're eliminating, you know, death from air pollution and slowing or reverse the effects of global warming. I don't see there's anything wrong with that. I think it's great if you have the resource. Yeah. So we have seen a lot of growth in the renewables industry in the last few years. But of course, it hasn't been immune to the challenges when it comes to supply chains that the economy as a whole is facing. And we've seen some of that really since last fall in increasing prices and a little bit more price volatility. I think that in the past, renewables prices have been consistently going down and that's changed a little bit. So how big a challenge has that been for the industry? And what are some of the main specific issues that have led to these rising prices and led to a little bit of the uncertainty? Well, you know, it's I mean, we're looking at this, this supply chain disruption is a global phenomenon, OK? And it affects all supply chain and all different industries, not just renewable energy. And, you know, beyond COVID-19 and the natural disasters there, you know, there have including cybersecurity breaches and trade disputes. All of these have taken their toll on the global supply chain. But I have to say that the supply chains are adapting and they're rebounding and businesses are examining the costs and challenges and how are they going to, you know, overcome them. And, you know, and I think it depends on the specific industry that you're in, you know, and how you can mitigate, you know, some of the supply chain issues. So when so, for example, you know, we represent a lot of EV companies and OEMs and battery suppliers and et cetera. And they clearly have, you know, a different driver to reduce the supply chain than, you know, for example, solar panels. So there are, you know, definitely ways to, you know, when you're when, you know, to to combat the supply chain challenges, you know, so in the EV space, for example, what we're seeing is that there have been innovation and frankly, a lot of M&A and they're looking at they're driving value in the supply chain, you know, whether it is developers or EV manufacturing, you're seeing what I'm seeing a lot of is that we're seeing the supply chain as a strategic asset rather than a tactical expense. And we look at trying to provide some intangible benefits to and, you know, economic benefits to advance the sustainability agenda. So sometimes that's, you know, we're seeing some acquisitions up on the vertical chain. We're seeing also that there, you know, as technologies and regulations mature, that there's a lot of companies that are evaluating their procurement strategies and how to take advantage of them. So but definitely the supply chain has been, you know, like a like I said, just it's been a global issue and everyone's dealing with it in different ways. There are some like in the automotive industry and others, they've just shut down factories because they're just they don't have enough. It's killing the business. You know, if they don't have a proper supply chain of strategies, there's many steps. That companies can take to appease some of these supply chain issues. But it is causing rising costs for raw materials and prolonged delays. And, you know, these are also causing like commodity prices to go up. It's bad. It's a global problem. That's bad for, you know, all industries, not just renewables. But, you know, in the renewables, it's like if we look at wind, for example, it's the price of steel, which comprises about 70 percent of the cost of a wind turbine, which is nearly twice as expensive as it was before the pandemic. And prices for other important metals are also rising. And then the shipping delays and high freight costs, plus the factory delays caused by covid has also hampered and caused delay in, you know, in planned projects. So the volume of renewable energy projects has definitely been falling. It is a rough patch right now, but it's not a death sentence. So it's definitely a good time for whether you're a developer or you're in private equity or you're a utility. These are these are some of the major clients that we represent. It's a good time to look at either acquisitions or some disposition or some other financing strategies that we can help provide to alleviate some of these supply chain woes. Along with the broader supply chain issues, another issue that was facing the industry is questions about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang province of China. I know that a lot of the solar panels, especially are sourced from China, and that has caused a lot of uncertainty for solar developers. How has the industry weathered that? Yeah, well, I've been involved in a lot of transactions where this, you know, has definitely affected our deal. And this has also caused spikes in the cost of the solar panels, you know, and there's been a lot of ways that companies are clearly dealing with this. But it highlights, you know, probably the biggest some of the Chinese, some of the largest, you know, yes, as you said, Andrew, the majority of all solar panels are made in China in this province. And like Longyi, for example, is probably the largest solar panel supplier. And there has been some pressure to eliminate these labor abuses from the country's supply chain without smothering, you know, the solar industries here in the United States. So it's a tough, tight rope that the Biden administration is walking on. What I've been seeing is that like the polysilicon, which is the key ingredient in solar panels, we have seen a lot of our developers look at sourcing polysilicon from other suppliers, and generally they tend to be much more expensive. It's been very important and very, you know, polarizing, depending on what side of the fence you stand on here in the United States, whether this is something that can be weathered or not. But it does it has caused major disruptions and it's very hard to pinpoint like all the different different exposures. So there have been some investigations into the U.S. solar supply chains which have been started. And, you know, definitely Chinese suppliers are on Washington's radar. You know, recently, a Biden administration extended the 203 tariffs, but they did leave the bifacial solar panels as an exception, which is going to be really important. So two sides of the story. You know, those developers and that rely very heavily on the Chinese solar panels will say that this is a political issue is not and it's not based on facts. And, of course, Beijing echoes this position. But, you know, the Biden administration is sees otherwise, you know, with respect to the 203 tariffs that were just passed. There is a high and rising trade risk to solar product imports. But, you know, again, there will be what the Biden administration is trying to do is to de-risk some of the solar deployment with new import constraints. And I think this whole thing with the, you know, the bifacial solar panels are very, you know, is a good exception and compromise. But again, the U.S. companies were dependent on the cooperation of the Chinese suppliers to implement tracing and auditing programs to verify that their supply chains are not exposed to potential labor issues. And I think, you know, the solar industry is adapting and changing and, you know, we're pivoting. So it is a problem, you know, and again, it's it's it's very polarizing in our industry. I don't know, Andrew, if that answers gives you some view. Yeah, absolutely. And certainly the developers need some clarity, at least in terms of how they're able to move forward. One final thing I wanted to ask you about is the policy front. Now, I have to say, when I was having conversations for most of last year, for much of last year, there was what I thought was maybe excessive, excessive optimism on the chances of a big renewables bill passing through Congress and being signed by the president. And I thought that might have been making its way into some deals. And in December, Joe Manchin said that he would not support Build Back Better, which was going to be the vehicle for a lot of this policy help for the renewables sector. Now, Mona, I'm curious whether since that's happened, there's been any kind of a reevaluation across the industry, if people are reevaluating how much they're willing to pay for assets now, now knowing that it's maybe a little bit more uncertain whether there's going to be a lot of policy help coming anytime soon. Well, let me just let me let me go back and kind of set up the history of the bill. You know, originally, Biden had a very large and ambitious bill that was including not just clean energy, but also infrastructure, among other things. You know, and they and then he really promoted this bill as part of his reelection platform. So when he got elected, you know, as president, people thought that, you know, this was kind of a slam dunk. It was going to happen. And then it it became very obvious very quickly early on that this was just too ambitious for our country to rally around. You know, there is too many, too many different initiatives here and government support. And then what happened was it was it was split into an infrastructure bill and a social clean energy. And that's really what the Build Back Better is now. And the infrastructure bill did pass, which was great. And now we're looking at this, you know, the Build Back Better. And we've had because we knew that it was going to be very difficult for the clean energy pieces because it really was very aggressive, was going to be passed. So now where we stand with the Build Back Better is and then I'll kind of tell you where I think it's going to go, is that it hasn't really gotten momentum. Senator Joe Moshin is focused very much on inflation, on the rising inflation, and he believes that Congress needs to constrain spending and the rising inflation. And I think with the inflation and even today what happened, you know, with the consumer price index rising over 7.5 percent and the fastest pace since 1982. These are all, you know, reverberating in Capitol Hill. And I think that lawmakers now are prioritizing trying to get inflation under control. And they want to, you know, once they have inflation under control, then we could focus more on the Build Back Better. There are I could tell you that there's ongoing discussions among Democrats about how to revive it in some form. But these inflation numbers are putting a finer point and how difficult it could be to cobble together a politically palatable reconciliation package. So what I see going forward is that this Build Back Better will likely be split up in different pieces. You know, like, for example, like one would be just the EV credit. One would be just the hydrogen PTC credit. I am I'm serving my third term. I'm on the board for ACOR and the American Council of Renewable Energy. And we are ACORPREF, we are working with members of Congress in, you know, trying to get at least smaller pieces of this to get some traction. And I can tell you that we have been. So I don't see the Build Back Better the way it is now, that all of it in its entirety will be passed the way it is. And I think that it's going to take a while because we need to get inflation under control a little bit more. And there are there's a lot of speculation about what's going to be done in our economy. But I do believe that, you know, we're definitely going to be seeing rate hikes at least for this year and the first one coming up in March. This is going to affect the Build Back Better as well. And I do see this and I'm very bullish, especially on certain portions of it, that it will will get passed because of all the support that we are seeing. You think at least the renewables aspect, you give it a good chance of getting of it getting passed before the midterm elections? It depends on where we land. Again, I think it's very much tied to inflation in our economy. And it depends on how aggressive, you know, the Fed is going to be with our rates and whether they're going to, like, shock the system or not. One of the things that I'm hearing is that there's a call for like an emergency rate hike, like 75 basis points in March. And if this would happen, then there would be, you know, it would help, I think, more with the Build Back Better, you know. But again, and I'm seeing a lot of banks revising and becoming more hawkish, you know, Citi, Goldman Sachs, you know, and I do believe that the Fed is definitely trying to. I don't want I want them to understand that this inflation, you know, it's increasing the risk that we will end up chasing the markets and not catching up soon enough. So, again, we're seeing a move up in yields and a flattening of some of the curves. And all of this is consistent with a greater with greater market concerns and, you know, possibly a policy error by by the Fed. And, you know, and I know I'm kind of going off a little bit off the reservation, but I believe that this directly impacts the Build Back Better. That's why I want people to understand why I'm focusing on inflation and our economy. Absolutely. There are a lot of moving parts here and it's always hard to predict what is going to come out of Washington. Well, Mona, thank you so much for joining me here today.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, a senior reporter for Sparkspread. Now, one year ago in February 2021, a winter storm known unofficially as Winter Storm Ori struck Texas, causing hundreds of deaths and tens of billions of dollars in damage as the Lone Star State's electric grid failed. Now, our guest today is Peter Crampton, who served as an independent director on the board of the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, better known as ERCOT, during the storm. Peter, thank you for joining me today for this discussion. My pleasure. So to start, can you tell me and our audience a little bit about your background and why you left ERCOT following last year's storm? Sure. So I've been designing complex markets, especially markets based on auctions, for the last 30 years. And since 1999, part of that work has been in designing electricity markets. And so I'm one of a handful of experts of electricity market design around the world. And it's that expertise that led ERCOT to ask me, actually the ERCOT board, to ask me to join the board. And I joined in 2015 and was on, served on the board as an independent director until February 2021. Following the storm, there was political pressure to change the governance structure and, in particular, not have any non-Texans on the board. And so all of the non-Texans, which included all of the independent directors, resigned from the board. So after the storm, there was a lot of talk about what changes were needed in order to ensure that next time such a storm hit, which eventually it will hit Texas, there is more resiliency and the outcome is not the same. Now, I know you at the time had some opinions. What were your thoughts? What did you think needed to be done? Well, many things. First, you have to understand the problem. So essentially, because of the extreme cold, there was a sharp drop in supply and as largely due to freezing. And simultaneously, there was a large spike in demand. And that created a gap of about 30% between demand and supply. Now, an electricity system has to always be balanced. And so effectively, 30% of the would-be demand had to be dropped. And that's the outages that affected about 4 million people for several days in Texas. Basically, to make the market more resilient, you need to do two things. One is you need to have less of a drop in supply and you need to have less of an increase in demand during extreme cold. And it's very important, actually, for the Texas system to address both the supply and the demand side. That will be more effective. On the supply side, so let me just look at the two problems. The supply side, there were many problems, but the largest one by far was the failure of the gas supply. Texas lost 45% of its gas supply due to the cold. And that loss led to many of the combined cycle gas units being unable to generate electricity. And so that was the big problem on the supply side. There were certainly many other problems, but that was the biggest one. And so one of the things that needs to happen is to make sure that there's proper winterization of all of the supply, including the gas supply. And that can be done at the generating units, but really the generating units must make sure that they have reliable fuel during these extreme events. And that's actually the one thing that I think has not happened and needs to happen going forward. Sorry, just to jump in, you mentioned this loss of supply and obviously these were extreme temperatures for Texas, but this type of cold, these types of storms are common throughout other parts of the country. So why was there such a failure when in other parts of the country they're able to maintain generation during similar storms or even worse storms? Oh, well, gas is winterized in places where it routinely is well below freezing. The situation is that in Texas, these are extremely unusual events. And so there's a reluctance to spend lots of money in order to insure against something that's very unlikely. So that's the big issue. And that's true of all the equipment in Texas. It's just not, it's designed for the, in fact, reliability in general in Texas is more designed for the extreme heat in the summer. Texas is a summer peaking market and much less so for the winter. But what Storm Uri points out is that these storms will happen. You know, perhaps this was a one in 30 year event, but nonetheless, it did happen. And perhaps they're happening more frequently. And so in any event, given the cost, both in terms of loss of life and dollar damage, it makes a lot of sense to invest in resilient infrastructure on the supply side. So it's something that should happen, but that's why it hasn't been done so far. It's actually quite problematic to get the, to make the gas supply resilient. And the reason is, has to do with both politics and economics. You know, essentially, on the economic side, the gas supply actually, collectively, they benefited from the poor reliability during the storm. Prices were extremely high, and those that supplied made lots of money. So about $11 billion shifted to gas suppliers as a result of this event. Whereas on the electricity side, it was almost entirely losses. So really, the motivation is not there. What you need is regulation for the, the regulator of gas to step in and impose obligations to winterize. But that's where the politics comes in, because the regulator of gas is largely captured by the gas industry. And so you don't have, you have a two week of an incentive unless somehow the politics changes. And is that different from other parts of the country in terms of who is regulating the gas supply? Oh, yeah, absolutely. The politics are quite different. Texas is the fossil fuel capital of the United States. And so they're, they're very influential in the politics. And by contrast, most of the rest of the US, the gas supply would be viewed as a service that benefits consumers and is regulated as such for the well being of the consumers. Whereas in Texas, it's regulated more for the benefit of the fossil fuel owners. So since the storm, there's been a lot of talk about how to make the system more resilient and some steps taken. How would you rate the progress that's been made so far to these ends? Well, I think that there has been a lot of progress on the simpler things like improved communications. I think on the harder things like fixing the gas supply, there's been almost no progress. The winterization of the electricity generating units, there's been a lot of progress. So that's very good. I think another area that's very important is the demand side and the demand side steps have not been taken. So that's another area where a lot more needs to be done. And in particular, as I started out, I said that there's two things, there's this drop in supply and the spike in demand. And so we have to address the spike in demand. And the two best ways to do that are one with energy efficiency. So boring things like insulation, caulking, thermal pane glass is needed in order to reduce the consumption of electricity during extreme cold and extreme hot events. That's why energy efficiency is so helpful, because it does exactly that. And then the other thing on the demand side is engaging the consumers in responding to the event in an appropriate way through the market price. So during the event, the wholesale price of electricity was $9,000 a megawatt hour, well over 100 times what it normally is. And that actually made a lot of sense, because the social cost of consuming electricity was extremely high there. By your consuming electricity, you were preventing somebody else from consuming electricity and heating their home, and perhaps keeping their pipes from freezing. And so it's actually very important for the consumers to be engaged. And there's almost all of the residential consumers in Texas faced a flat rate and so had no incentive to engage in reducing their demand. So in the markets going forward, it's very important to engage the consumer. And fortunately, the new technology, electric vehicles, smart thermostats, heat pumps, all these things, solar panels are powerful ways for the consumer to be engaged in the electricity market in very simple ways, at least eventually. Essentially managing their demand so that they're consuming less when the price is very high, and they're consuming more when the price is very low. And so that's something that needs to be worked on. And unfortunately, Texas actually had a fair amount of innovation in this regard. But has, if anything, taken a step back. One of the first pieces of legislations that was passed and signed by the governor following the event was actually a ban of consumer rate plans that exposed the consumer to the wholesale cost of electricity. And I view that as as actually quite problematic. And that, if I remember, was the result of a lot of normal homeowners who after the storm had these exorbitant tens of thousands of dollar electricity bills. Is that unavoidable? If we are to have some type of responsiveness? It's completely avoidable. And you're absolutely right. That was the source for that's what made the issue politically salient and for the legislature to take action, but they took the wrong action. What they should have done is encouraged plans and accepted plans that expose the consumer on the margin, but limit the downside risk. And so what we had was very first generation plans that exposed the consumer to the wholesale price, but didn't limit the downside. And so that's where you got these large bills from customers that were not paying attention and didn't move out of those plans in before the storm. But it's very much possible to eliminate the downside. And so then, rather than being seeing and feeling the social cost of using the electricity as being this enormous downside risk during the storm, it becomes a enormous opportunity where they actually can, by reducing their consumption, they can be sent a check for many thousands of dollars, rather than paying a bill for many thousands of dollars. And that works simply with standard hedging approaches that would be managed on behalf of the consumer, so they wouldn't actually have to worry about it. They would just have to know that they would get these alerts that, oh, it's an opportunity to save a lot of money if you turn the thermostat down to 50 degrees. So after the storm, there was a lot of talk about the role that wind energy played. Texas has more wind power and generates more of its energy from wind than any other state. And during the storm, a lot of these turbines froze up. And there was a lot of discussion, both regarding that and whether the intermittency of relying on wind made the grid less resilient. I know that you are skeptical of wind energy, but can you explain why? Sure. So wind and solar as well, they're both intermittent resources, and sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not. A no electricity systems resiliency strategy is based upon, or reliability strategy, is based upon these intermittent resources. And so what the system operator does is they look at various extreme events, extreme heat, extreme cold, and assess how resources are apt to perform during these extreme events. And you're looking at more of the worst case with respect to the production. And so, for example, solar, you assume that the events happening at night, and there is no solar, and so solar is assumed to be zero during such an extreme event. Similarly, for wind, you're expecting, closer to the worst case, that there's very little wind production. There's some wind production, but very little. Whereas the gas units, you're expecting, and nuclear and coal, the conventional generation, you're expecting much higher levels of reliability and production during the events. And so in these plans, wind and solar actually outperformed what they were expected to do during an extreme winter storm, and it was gas especially that fell short, although coal and nuclear even fell short of what was expected. And so that's really why it doesn't make any sense to point the finger at wind and solar. You're not counting on wind and solar in such an event. So even with all the freezing, even with the problems of the turbines, wind outperformed what it was expected to in these types of circumstances. Yes, that's correct. And certainly more could be done with winterization of the turbines. And there it's just a question of the economics. Is it more economic to winterize a combined cycle unit or to winterize a bunch load of wind turbines? And I think it depends upon their exact location, what the production is and so on, but it really should be a market-driven response. The resources have the right incentives. They're seeing and feeling the actual wholesale price. And so are motivated to make the right decision with respect to winterization. Now, another way that Texas is unique is that when it comes to its electrical grid, it is not 100%, but somewhat of an island, less integrated than the rest of the country. And I know that Texans have historically taken great pride in that, but a lot of people said that was part of what made this storm so devastating to the electrical system. Do you think that played a large role? And do you think it could be a long-term solution to try to integrate Texas more into the national grid? Do you think that's something that might be achievable? So interconnection is very important for resiliency, and it's something that should definitely be studied. It is something that in this particular event would have helped less than one might think because of the size of the storm. Effectively, the folks to the east and the folks to the north were largely affected by the same storm. And as a result, there was very little that could be drawn from, very little power that could be drawn from the north or the east. If there was strong interconnection all the way west, then that would have been helpful, but that interconnection doesn't exist right now. I think one of the reasons less attention has been paid to the interconnection is because of the time lag needed for that to be the solution. So if we're talking about storms that are going to be happening 20 years from now, then interconnection should play a large role. If you're talking about addressing storms that might happen this year or next year or even five or 10 years from now, interconnection is not going to happen fast enough to address the issues. So we can't rely on interconnection. That said, I think that it's something that should be on the table. It's something that's going to be very important for Texans to address, and especially as the more innovative Texas energy companies move away from fossil fuels and recognize the enormous solar and wind potential that Texas has and really wanting to be the energy capital of the future, then interconnection is going to be absolutely critical for Texans in order to gain the value of the enormous solar and wind resources. So the day-to-day use of the interconnection will be to export wind and solar, and it just has an additional benefit in terms of resiliency for those unusual one-in-10-year, one-in-20-year events. So it's been one year since winter storm Ori hit Texas, and as we've discussed, there have been some measures taken and there still remains a lot more to be done. Now, in your estimation, if let's say a year from now or even again this month, another winter storm, the same size, the same power as winter storm Ori were to hit Texas, is Texas better prepared? Would the results be less drastic or would we see the same type of failure that we saw last year? I think they're much better prepared. So there would be a lot less damage. There would be a lot less loss of life because Texans I think now recognize the importance of not letting your pipes freeze and making sure that you have emergency supplies. And so all those things that greatly magnified the number of deaths and damages I think would occur even if you had a multi-day outage for 4 million people. So that's point one. So yes, damages could be a lot less and would be a lot less. In terms of performance of the gas supply, I wouldn't expect much of an improvement at all this year or even next year. So there's still, I would expect much improved performance of the nuclear and the gas units that are able to get gas and the coal units. So I think that there would be less of a supply drop than we saw, but there would still be quite significant because of the loss of gas supply. So there would be shortage. And my hope is that the consumers would be better able to weather it because of what they learned from Ori. Well, Peter, this has been a very interesting conversation and it'll be interesting to keep up with all the changes that are going on in Texas. Peter, I appreciate you joining me today. My pleasure. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for tuning into Crossroads. Don't forget to like and subscribe and stay tuned for more exciting episodes coming up. Transcribed by https://otter.ai

Today I'm joined with Manuel Quinche, head partner at Bogota's office for Cuatro Casas and head of the LATAM project finance practice at Cuatro Casas. I also have Giulio Comellini on the line, information news research manager in New York covering Latin America. Manuel, Giulio, welcome to the podcast. Thank you, Eddie. Thank you, Manuel, for having us here. It is a pleasure to share with you and your audience. Thank you. Pleasure. Manuel, just a little bit about you, from what I understand, you previously spent 22 years at Brigada Lutia before joining Cuatro Casas, during which time, between 2005 and 2010, you also served as an associate attorney at Sidley Austin for the LATAM practice group. So I want to ask, it's been a year since joining Cuatro Casas. How's the experience been different? And tell me about your success. Thank you, Eddie, and once again, thank you for having us for this podcast. I could say that last year was was really an incredible year. We started operations of our board office in January. And to be honest, that alone has been absolutely exciting because everything that opening an office entails. And also, it was exciting to see that even though the pandemics, the Colombian economy continued to grow at rates that we haven't even seen before the pandemics. And that was really in part thanks to the dynamism of the infrastructure sector. It is a reality that Colombia's 4G program has been not only the most ambitious one, but also the most successful one in Colombia's history. And now we Colombians are really benefiting from the impact it is having in the economy. So the combination, Eddie, of opening an office and finding a very dynamic infrastructure sector, as you can imagine, for people that does what I do, it's a really thrilling opportunity. And that's the reason why the balance of last year is really positive. We were very busy. And of course, we are now looking forward to what the next year or this year, actually, I'm sorry, it's going to bring us. And I would like to mention a couple of things about what happened last year, because because that's probably going to frame the conversation that we're going to have. And it's going to frame what I think should be the investor appetite in Colombia's infrastructure sector. And I would like to highlight that some events that happened last year are really real life evidence that we can still achieve even more success for Colombia's infrastructure sector. In one hand, the National Infrastructure Agency, ANI, reached a much needed agreements with toll road and airport concessionaires, not helping them deal with the effects of the pandemic. And this, to my mind, shows the government's will to ensure the success of the infrastructure sector, but also the understanding that keeping the sector in good health is critical for economic recovery. I would say that those agreements have been a tremendous precedent, also because they involve not only ANI and the concessionaires, but also the Colombian controlling entities as well as Colombia's Agency for Legal Defense. Without the participation of those entities, those agreements would have not been possible. And I found, to be honest with you, that those agreements send a very important positive message to infrastructure investors, not only in Colombia, but around the world, because it really showed the government commitment with the success of the current infrastructure programs. It creates a track record for future infrastructure programs like the 5G infrastructure program, which is not really a future program, but now a reality. And also the availability of legal mechanisms to make sure that investors and concessionaires are not, let's say, disproportionately affected by situations like the pandemic. So in a way, this alone shows, as I was saying before, the government commitment in the one hand, and also the strength of the infrastructure program and the strength and good design of the concessions that we have in place. In addition to that, last year, we in Colombia saw, for instance, how the 4G program showed a 60% of execution and investments in excess of $30 billion, with some of the toll roads already finished. And I believe that we Colombians now could safely say that the 4G program has been really a success and has demonstrated Colombia's capability to generate projects and to generate development and, of course, to benefit not only Colombia, but the region with programs like these ones. So I'm saying this because, of course, for all those of us that were in the very beginning of the 4G concession program and that have witnessed the 3G and the 2G and the 1G concessions, at a given point in time, the program seemed to be very ambitious. And sometimes people saw it as unrealistic and saw it as something probably that couldn't be achieved in Colombia because of the legal framework that we have or the way the National Infrastructure Agency works and so on. But the reality has proven us wrong. It has been possible. And as I said before, it has now has 60% of more of execution, very significant investments, projects that are achieving pre-completion. And now what we are seeing is a second package of projects in the form of the 5G concessions. In addition to that, there have been or there were very positive messages for the infrastructure sector that are going to be crucial for this year and the years ahead. And one of those messages, for instance, has been somehow embedded in the crisis of the Ituango project. As you know, the Ituango project is one of the most ambitious projects for the energy or power generation sector in Colombia. And the project has continued to recover. Insurance companies are now playing their part in bringing back the project to life and to recovery. And that alone is very good news because two years ago or three years ago, it was even in doubt whether the project was going to be feasible or not. So now it's close to a reality. I guess there are messages and there are lessons learned there that we need to analyze over time because that's going to be very important, actually, for the development of the overall infrastructure sector in Colombia. And the reason for that is it's because we were left with some questions that are still unanswered about the role of construction companies, for instance, in being fiscally liable with the Colombian government in connection with construction activities and so on. So that's something that we may need to resolve one way or the other because for people like me that does projects and it's involved in the structuring of projects, one of the questions, of course, that would arise over time is whether the Ituango project could repeat itself in terms of all the legal developments of all the investigations against the construction companies. And in all honesty, probably what it's going to leave us also as a lesson that needs to be learned over time and needs to be an interpretation, needs to be construed is whether what's going to be the extent of those liabilities, because, of course, it could be the case that if those liabilities are there or are in a way excessive, foreign and local investors may just be prevented from participating in this project. But in any case, I mentioned the Ituango development as something very positive for the infrastructure sector, but something also that calls us to or requires us to reflect on it and to analyze what the legal implications we would like them to be, in essence, because of the impact that this may have over time on construction companies. Fantastic. Thanks for that explanation, Manuel. It's interesting. You're right. We have seen plenty of activity, particularly in Colombia. You mentioned highways. You mentioned hydroelectric. That has also been quite formidable and withstanding a lot of challenges, too, from the pandemic and other legal challenges as well. And I wanted to ask more about which other sectors provide the best opportunities for project finance. We've seen projects with waterways, hospitals and telecommunications. Which other sectors outside of highways and transport provide great opportunities for project finance, in your opinion? Yes, you're right, Eddie. The Colombian infrastructure sector, it's really behaving well. It's developing well. As I mentioned before, there are very real reasons to see that the sector is successful and that it's being developed in a very healthy way. And as part of that, the obvious consequence when a government is successful doing these things and when investors are interested in participating in these projects is that you have to launch more projects. And that's exactly what the Colombian government is doing with the 5G program. I have to say that the launching or the takeoff of the 5G program was very successful. It showed the increased trust that investors and local are having in the sector. To give you an example, for the first time ever, and it saw the qualification of eight bidders for a project, which for Colombian standards was unheard of. And this shows, of course, the increased interest in the country and obviously the increased trust that market participants are having in the sector. The first wave of the 5G program comprises 14 projects with investments in excess of 22 billion pesos. We are talking about five billion dollars or something around that ballpark. And of course, there will be opportunities everywhere, to be honest with you, because when you have very sizable projects in the toll road spectrum, but also in the railway sector, airports and waterways, then it's sort of a perfect combination of most of the infrastructure available being active. And what we are seeing as well is significant opportunities in the energy sector. The energy transition in Colombia is a reality. Of course, it's a reality that it's lived in a different way than in other countries, because we all have to remember and keep in mind that Colombia's energy matrix was already a very clean energy matrix because of the hydropower generation. Having said that, we are seeing now many developers in the developing stage of solar projects or eolic projects. And last year alone, for instance, we participate in, I would say, very significant financings for the sectors, for the energy sector with projects that are very interesting for every standard. And we are seeing, for instance, the international energy companies coming to Colombia, looking into these projects and actually committing to these projects. And we have seen two ways of doing it. We've seen companies that are really testing the waters with small projects. And our impression is that they are, of course, testing the legal framework and whether banks are available to finance these projects and so on. But also we've seen, for instance, the experience of Matrix Renewables, which is one of the large players in the renewable generation sector, coming to Colombia with a large portfolio of projects and also in a very successful way. They closed the financing with IDB and Bank Colombia last year, and they are expected to continue to do that for developing additional projects. We know of other companies with, let's say, billion dollar dreams in the Colombian energy sector. So I think most of the action for break finance would probably be there. We also see other projects coming, for instance, we see projects in the infrastructure spectrum related to hospitals, to public infrastructure as concert halls, stadiums, sports facilities. We are currently working in one, for instance, that would be very important for one Colombian region. I cannot mention which one at this point in time, because of confidentiality reasons, but I would say that it's a project that is going to change, of course, the way in which entertainment and sports facilities are financing Colombia. So with that in mind, this year presents many opportunities. It's been an unusual year, to be honest with you, because to an extent it's an election year. We would have expected that, for instance, last year the activity would have slowed down by, let's say, September, October, November, but it wasn't really the case. Let's see how the new bid processes go. We have also an important break coming up, which is basically the second line of the Bogota metro, which is in the structuring stage. And if launched, of course, it would add to the line one of the metro and, of course, would add to this very long list of projects that would be interesting for both local and international investors. It sounds like there's plenty of opportunity going on in Colombia. I see we're running against the clock a little bit at this point, but I briefly wanted to mention renewables projects, since it's quite interesting. There recently was a PPA auction, Power Purchase Agreement auction in 2021 that drew in a lot of international investors. But what was peculiar about that auction was it was all in pesos. There wasn't a dollar component. So a lot of people were wondering, where does this leave the room for international banks and investors to participate in financing these projects? So I wanted to briefly ask you, what opportunities are there for international banks and investors to participate in financing Colombian renewable projects when these projects are in pesos? So on the renewable energy spectrum, we perceive there are opportunities for international investors and banks. Having said that, there are two issues. One is related to the specific size of some of those projects. Some of those projects still, let's say, do not fit the ticket that is usual for an international investor or a bank. And on that front, I guess we just have to pass the stage where developers are really testing the waters with those projects. We know from some of our clients, for instance, that their idea was to develop one or two initial projects to see how the system works, to see how the reality of building a project in Colombia goes. And if it goes well, then there will be much larger projects. And I'm sure that the results of those tests would go well. The other thing that we are seeing is that, of course, there are large portfolios of projects. Last year alone, Matrix Renewables closed an initial financing for several projects and expects to do the same this year. And on that front, probably there will be a space for international lenders and investors. One of the things that we are seeing that is very interesting, and we are working in one financing like that, as we speak, it's the arrival of synthetic loans, loans denominated in synthetic pesos. These type of transactions, I believe, would become more common and common, of course, depending on the availability or the willingness of investors to do that. But we are seeing that they are being, let's say, efficient and competitive in terms of costs for the developer and the sponsor. So probably where we, let's say, mix large portfolios of projects with the possibility of doing synthetic transactions, then we may find a really good space for foreign banks and investors to enter into those projects and finance them. I'm glad to hear you're working on one of the financings involving synthetic loans. I was speaking with Minister Diego Mesa about an upcoming plan for offshore wind development in the north of Colombia along the Caribbean coast. You wouldn't be able to say which transaction you're working on regarding synthetic financing, would you? No, but you will have the first news as soon as it is closed. We love that. We would love to hear that. Yes. Thank you. You know, I wanted to talk briefly about there's also other opportunities in the Colombian market on the secondary infrastructure market. I'm talking about M&A activity amongst international fund managers buying into projects. And we also see that M&A activity within the renewable space as well. So Manuel, could you tell me a bit about M&A activity that you've seen within infrastructure market in Colombia? Yes, I would say it's a natural evolution. As you know, for instance, in Colombia, one of the key features of the market is that many construction companies that are not really or necessarily interested in the concession business enter into these concessions because, of course, they wanted to be involved in the APC contract and so on. So with that in mind, what is happening is a natural evolution of that. When the projects are really getting close to completion, we are seeing several things. The construction companies leaving the concessions but staying in the APC contracts. And also, we are seeing another phenomenon, which is also important to highlight and has to do a lot with the, let's say, joint venture that Rodin is entering to with Macquire in the sense that we are also seeing the creation of joint ventures between local and international companies to develop infrastructure platforms. I know at least of two initiatives on that respect. Of course, they remain still confidential, but it's something that for sure is going to move the needle in a way for the M&A activity in the infrastructure sector in Colombia. I would say that I'm not sure at what pace M&A would happen, at least in the first six or seven months of this year, and that has to do with the presidential elections that we're having and, of course, the concerns that a political process like this one usually raises in foreign investors and so on. But I would say there will be activity, and let's say the indexes for that activity will increase as time passes because if we last year had the finishing or the completion of three toll routes, we'll be seeing more projects being completed, and with that, of course, we'll see more M&A activity for sure. Fantastic. You briefly mentioned projects finishing construction, and we've also seen another phenomenon, too, a lot of refinancings of 4G roads going on right now as well. Some refinancings going on within the private market, but also within the public market as well. I'm thinking of the Aburra Oriente Tunnel refinancing happened on the public Colombian capital markets. So what do you think about refinancings in the Colombian market now, 4G roads? Yeah, they're rational. They're similar to what is happening in the M&A activity in the sense that as projects get close to pre-completion, of course, CFOs and financial officers, it's almost mandatory for them to evaluate whether the cost of the financing they got for the construction of the project and whether once the construction risk is away, whether those costs could be lowered. So yes, we are seeing a lot of that, and it's happening in several ways. Bank financing is being refinanced with bank financings. We are also seeing bank finances being refinanced in the capital markets. And in the capital markets, we're seeing those refinances are happening sometimes internationally, sometimes locally in the Colombian capital markets. It's very interesting what you mentioned about the Tunnel de Aburra because that's a present that is going to open a very good door for Colombian projects to get financing in the capital markets. We know at least of two additional projects that are coming up to market after the Tunnel de Aburra project. And in a way, it's excellent news because it's really the capital markets playing the role they have in other countries where basically once you don't have construction risk, the most sound option or let's call it the cheaper option is usually financing that way. So refinancing activity will be there. I don't think refinancings would be stopped because of the election season. And because at the end of the day, you got the completion, you got to see what you do with your project. And the obvious step is really to move to other markets or to change instruments with a view to have a more efficient financing structure. Fantastic. You know, we're coming up close to the end of our podcast. I just want to briefly ask, there's an election coming up in Colombia soon. There's been a lot of talk about it. How do you think the upcoming election will affect the pipeline of projects? Well, as it happens, elections usually slow the pace of investments in a country and slow the pace of activity. And usually that's linked to the uncertainty as to what would be the outcome of the elections. I have a very personal perception, and I'm sure not necessarily other people share that. But I believe that for the next government, it would be a huge mistake not to continue and working in the infrastructure sector or not to continue to grow the infrastructure sector. Because in essence, at least for the governments that have passed since the inception of the 3G concession program and the 4G and now the 5G, that's been one of their successes, right? And in a way their legacy. So I have the hope that at least for the 5G generation of projects and other infrastructure projects, the trend would continue to be the same. We hope that ANI as an agency would continue to be managed the way it's been managed or maybe improved. But in any case, the same entity that has made possible the 4G and the 5G program. I'm saying this because I just think it would be a brutal mistake to go the other way around. Either the government, the new government is in the right or in the left. Both would be looking to create employment and to create social development and economic development. And under that promise, either you're in the right or the left, what better than infrastructure projects, right? So I have the temptation to say that regardless of the outcome of the elections, we will continue seeing projects in Colombia and a healthy infrastructure sector. Fantastic. And my final question for you, what advice would you give to clients, new clients looking to enter and invest in the Colombian infrastructure market? Well, as a lawyer, when you face a foreign investor, a bank, an international sponsor, one of the first conversations that you have, it's really about whether you can trust the system, whether you can trust the legal system in Colombia, whether the concession agreement is a well-structured one, whether the government complies with those concessions or with these agreements, whether there are certain changes in law that create risk for investors and so on, and you spend a fair amount of time discussing that. And I would say that over the years, that discussion has become simpler and easier because we in Colombia have been building, let's say, a track record on developing projects and on the legal framework applicable to those projects. And when you look at certain sectors, for instance, when you take the energy sector, I would say that it's a very modern sector by any standard, and in a way, it's totally reliable for foreign investors. And the same, I would say, it's happening little by little with, for instance, the toll road concession sector, where we have now a concession agreement that is internationally bankable. And the reason I'm saying that is because if that wasn't the case, we wouldn't have the most important banks of the world financing these projects. So when you have that combination, I guess the first answer to a foreign investor would be have trust, have trust in the system, have trust that the government has a track record in making this project successful. Of course, as it happens not only in Colombia, but in every other country, legal disputes arise and things happen over time. But in general, when you look at it from good distance, you could say the Colombian investment climate, at least in the infrastructure sector, it's favorable. We have not really registered a reason, let's say, quote unquote, strategies for foreign investors, as it has happened in other countries, for instance. So what I would tell them is to trust the system, and of course, to get good guidance. In some instances, having also a local partner doesn't hurt, because one of the things what we are seeing is that when you're very new to the market, you better get someone local if you really want to win, for instance, a concession. But other than that, I would say that this is a sector that is evolving, it's professionalizing itself more and more, and it should be a sector that by international standards is acceptable to foreign investors. Fantastic. Great and convincing. Thank you very much for that, Manuel, and thank you very much for your time. To close out this podcast, I want to invite Giulio Comellini to speak about the lead table report that we published for 2021, and trends he's seen in Latin America and also in Colombia. Giulio? Hi, Manuel. Thanks for having me today. Well, Manuel said much, I try to do my best to add some value here. So 2021 was a record year globally for the private energy and infrastructure markets. And we saw the same trend happening in Latin America for both deal values and number of deals reaching financial close. So if we take aside Brazil for one second, which is a master market share, and it accounts for almost, let's say 50% of the total Latin American activity, Colombia has shortened the gap from the top countries of the region, which are Chile and Mexico. And this is because as Manuel was saying before, it was a year of growth for the Colombian infrastructure market. And especially because 2020 was a bit of a slowdown in terms of transactions closing, we saw this spike in activity. The sector that drove the market was once again, transportation, especially in the road subsector and in the port subsector, just like Puerto de Antioquia reaching financial close at the end of the year. You guys were talking about this before, but I like to mention that important Greenfield PPP projects funded this year include the 4G Río Magdalena 2 and the Vías del Luz highways, but also the refinancings of other 4G projects, which are the Girardot, Puerto Salgar, and SACIR's Puerta de Hierro. The strong performance is shown in our leak table report that Eddie mentioned before. And it's shown in the fact that Colombia ranked eighth globally in our Greenfield PPP country chart. So it's a very, very high position and increased the year-over-year performance of the country. I just like to highlight one of the most interesting trends that I've seen in 2021. And it confirmed, again, that international players are looking at Colombia very closely. You guys talked about lenders before, but I also like to mention developers. We saw the PPA auction. It was very attractive. And we saw great appetite from international companies like EDF, Canadian Solar, Enel, SolarPAC. They all won PPA contracts during the auction. And the same thing happened with the Maya Vial del Valle del Cauca. At the beginning of the year, we saw this first 5G project to be awarded. And many foreign developers participated in the tender. Oacele, SACIR, STRABAG, and obviously, Patria, which won the concession in a consortium. So we saw the Colombian market growing. And we forecast more opportunities coming in the traditional market, but also in new technologies like offshore wind and hydrogen. Fantastic. Thanks for the explanation, Julio. And that concludes our podcast today. Julio, Manuel, I had a really great time talking with you all today. I learned a lot. And I hope our listeners did too. So thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Eddie. It was a pleasure. Thanks for listening to the Crossroads Podcast. Be sure to subscribe and listen to more Crossroads Podcast. We'll catch you next time.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2022-01-25 22:38:27+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### 2021 League Tables and Fundraising activity\n**Episode ID:** 4354\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nI'm John Weiland, head of research for InfraLogic. Welcome to InfraLogic's Crossroads podcast. I'm joined today by research managers Alexander McLeod and Giulio Camellini to discuss InfraLogic's 2021 league tables and fundraising reports. Guys welcome. Giulio, let's start with you. What do you see as the most significant highlights from 2021? Hi John. Well, thanks for having me today. First of all, we need to say that 2021 was a record year for the infrastructure and energy markets funded by the private sector. We saw deal volume rising by almost 27% year over year, which is like a big data, right? Going more in depth, what caught my eye was that these growing figures in new attractive and ESG friendly technologies like hydrogen, but also battery storage, EV infrastructure and RNG projects. This is because the market is changing, especially in the energy spheres for reasons that we all know about. And we have an increasing demand for new projects, right? Think about hydrogen, for instance. We actually did not see too many greenfield projects closing in 2021, but we saw a spike in development agreements. So basically companies coming together and creating joint ventures to develop hydrogen projects. In terms of financing though, usually these projects require big, big investments, more than billion dollar investments. So this could take longer to raise that, right? So we forecast this financing to take place in the next couple of years, and it's actually very exciting from our perspective to see which players will take part in these deals and will participate in this market. I think it's important also to separate the interest caught by green hydrogen and blue hydrogen. Basically, green hydrogen requires renewable energy to produce, while blue hydrogen requires natural gas. And the recent spike in global prices made green hydrogen much more attractive. Green hydrogen will surely be a hit in the next decade for big markets, but also for emerging countries. I like to mention Chile, Uruguay, Colombia, but also India. They are very active and they have governments that are pushing towards this new technology and this new type of energy source. Talking about other subsectors, we saw a massive amount of deals closing in 2021 in the battery storage subsector, especially in the US and in the UK. One of the most interesting deals is NextEra Energy funding a battery storage system in California by raising approximately $700 million in debt. With 10 lenders involved. So it was a very complex and structured financing. The US market was also very active for RNG, they are renewable natural gas projects, where we saw more than double of deals reaching financial close year over year compared with 2020. In this field, it's interesting the approach we're seeing from big players of the market. Just think that Macquarie launched this week a new platform to develop these type of projects. They're basically converting waste into low carbon energy. So 2021 was very exciting for these markets. We saw these new trends, they're creating many new opportunities and they will continue doing it for sure in the next years. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alex. Yeah. Hi, John. Yeah. I think for me, on the other hand, you know, taking into account all of those positive renewable stories, it was also a big year for, let's say the more traditional energy sectors. You had major one-off projects in Russia, the Arctic to LNG project sponsored by a consortium of oil majors that clocked in at around 25 billion US dollars. There's also an Amur gas chemical complex that was sponsored by a Sino-Russian petrochemicals consortium at around 10 billion US dollars capex. And on top of this, there was 17 exploration and production deals, and this is way more than previous years. So major sales of gas and oil blocks, anywhere from Nigeria to Oman. The list was topped by energy transfers, 7.2 billion US dollar acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners in the US late in the year. These kinds of big energy deals, I think, are responsible for propelling countries like Norway and Saudi Arabia, usually much smaller fish up the league tables for the total deal value. Norway, for instance, jumped from position 54 to 19, Saudi Arabia from 36 to 9. And on Saudi Arabia, the Middle East was carried by oil and gas last year. Of the 9 deals in that region, above 1 billion US dollars, about 6 were in oil and gas. Companies like Saudi Aramco and Adnok, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, they realized the value of spinning their sprawling portfolios off to deep-pocketed infrastructure funds. And I suppose the ongoing energy crisis and the subsequent driving up gas and oil prices, it means that infrastructure investors are realizing that these are strong and stable revenues and it's consistently delivering strong numbers to their shareholders. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, well, one clear result from our reports was that 2021 was the biggest year on record for project finance activity. Yes, John. I mean, the high number of deals reaching financial close this year that we mentioned before is totally linked to higher figures in the project financing activity. Especially loans, actually more than bonds have increased their numbers, their figures, compared with the previous 4-5 years. This is surely connected to the fact that pricing of private infrastructure debt has been influenced by low interest rates. On our global and regional lead table report, we have the top lenders by value chart. Just imagine that 19 out of 20 banks have increased their yearly values year over year in terms of money lent, which is the data that reflects properly this growth, right? And also, if we look at specific sectors, it's indicating the trend of some expanding markets. I'm thinking about telecoms, for instance, which includes data centers and fiber optics. And imagine that in the past two years, the project financing figures have almost doubled. Yeah. I agree there. I think the global sector split was remarkably similar to last year, but telecoms deserve a special mention for having another big year defined by high value fiber co-spinoffs. It's generally a trend that started a few years ago with telecoms companies partnering with infrastructure investors to finance their ambitious FTTH or FTTP programs, rolling out ultra-fast broadband to customers and their millions. This year, in Italy alone, KKR and Macquarie paid in the billions for stakes in fiber JVs sold by Telecom Italia and Open Fiber. Other key deals include a US$6 billion fiber JV between Allianz Capital Partners and Telefónica in Germany. Pardon my German, but unsere grüne Glasfaser. Meanwhile in the US, the Stone Peak Infrastructure Fund paid over US$8 billion for TPG Capital's cable and fiber optics company Astound. So it's clear that fiber deals continue apace as investors seek to profit from the growing demand for faster connections. Already this year, $7 billion fiber deals are pending financial close, and that's mostly in the M&A space. Interesting. Okay. We've gotten into the regions a little bit. Let's talk a little bit more about regions. Where did the most activity take place this past year? Well, if we go more locally to the Americas, the US confirmed again as the main market and imagine that they accounted for almost 30% of the total global activity, which is a big number. However, even if this deal value increased, the number of deals reaching financial close decreased. The take out here is that the numbers were affected by big deals. We recorded many big M&A deals driving this figure. I'm thinking of Canadian Pacific acquiring Kansas City Sounder, which is a transportation company in a $33 billion deal, or Blackstone that acquired a data center company named QTS Realty Trust for $10 billion. If we go south, if we move to Latin America, Brazil has been once again the driver of the region, accounting for almost 50% of the total market of Latin America and Caribbean. Brazil was also one of the best year-over-year performers. It ranked fourth in the location ranking chart we produced following the US, the UK, and Australia. Okay. Interesting. Well, what about outside of the Western Hemisphere? Yeah, yeah. Just to say that first in Europe, it was definitely a less remarkable story with the usual top five. UK, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, they all held similar positions to last year. But no, yeah. As mentioned, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were the main players in the Middle East considering the big ticket energy deals. There were no African entries in the lead table top 25, but Nigeria is notable for having three of the continent's top 10 biggest deals across energy and transport sectors. In Asia and Australasia, Australia usually leads the region. It does this year. But it also stands out for the number of big ticket deals. It did have the lowest number of deals which reached financial close in a number of years, but the total deal volume was still around the same at about US$52 billion. And it's thanks to big deals across a diversity of sectors, including the massive US$8.4 billion Southeast Link Motorway PVP. Unsurprisingly, in Asia itself, China leads the way thanks to some big energy and renewable M&As. But there's also a 3.3 billion metro PVP in the port city of Tianjin, which reached financial close in June. But generally, in some across all regions, there were strong performances driven by the revived appetite among infrastructure investors following the pandemic. Interesting. Okay. Well, let's talk a little bit about fundraising, where we also had a record year. Tell us a little bit about what happened last year and what's the outlook for this year? Sure. Yeah. Fundraising had a big year, record year, as you said. Total annual fund capital raised at final close last year was close to US$110 billion, a new high. Notable mentions include KKR, which in the second half of 2021 surpassed its initial target of US$12 billion, and it's on track for a US$17 billion final close later this quarter. Meanwhile, the latest, largest fund to close last year was EQT Partners Infrastructure Fund 5, which reached a US$17.8 billion final close. Moving to the renewable space, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners' fourth fund reached a US$7.94 billion final close. And that's by far the largest renewables fund to date. And on that topic, renewable and energy transition funds made up around 22% of the total capital raised, with about 15 funds reaching final close during the year. And again, that's by far the largest proportion of such funds raised. And such activity is definitely set to continue. With Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, it's set to launch its fifth infrastructure fund with a staggering target of US$25 billion this quarter. Meanwhile, similarly, Global Infrastructure Partners is set to launch its fifth fund also. And although the target size is not yet clear, generally the funds have been sized similarly to Brookfield's. For more information, if anyone's interested, you can read the fundraising report written earlier this week by our Head of Funds Research, Pablo Martinez. Yeah, and so sounds like 2022 may be on track to be another record of fundraising and activity here. Alex, Giulio, I thank you both for joining us.

Welcome to InfraLogic's Crossroads Podcast. I'm joined today by Features Reporter, Demi Corbin, who will discuss two recent articles, piece on how middle market infrastructure funds are targeting double-digit investor returns to set themselves apart from large cap funds, and an article on how InfraFund managers are approaching estimates of the future impact of climate change in their investing strategies. Please click the links included in the Crossroads invitation posted on our website to read the actual articles. Demi, welcome. Why don't you tell us a little bit about the fund return story and how it came about? Absolutely. So, basically, with that story, I was going through several of our internal fundraising reports that we do publish on InfraLogic, and basically looking at the data, I saw that we've seen some uptick in the new entrants or first-time funds, as they call themselves. And those funds were basically focused on the mid-market space. And what was interesting and what I was trying to find out through this article is whether there's a trend within the space, whether there's an uptick, just generally because if we look back at the data, if we look back at three years before this new trend, we see that some large-cap funds were actually exiting the space. And this created a gap of which those mid-market funds, those new entrants, are trying to fill just because of this overwhelming interest that we see in infrastructure as an asset class. And now we see that LPs are also looking for what's next for their traditional infrastructure portfolios and mid-cap transactions are obviously one of the ways to go. And there's several reasons why the choice of a mid-cap fund. So one of them is that they're not particularly, so they're new, but they're not particularly unexperienced because they do have some prior experience through their team members who have operating experience in the infrastructure space. And as you mentioned with the headline of the story, they're promising premium returns of about 9% to 12%, if not more, because they're looking at the new spaces, new subsectors, such as energy transition, digital infrastructure, and the likes. Now the main issue that we were trying to see with this story is if we can compare the returns to traditional infrafunds and see whether they are actually going to meet the promising returns that they're preaching on. Right. There was some discussion as to whether that would happen with at least one of your sources saying they think the returns might be a little lower than those promise returns. One question I had was, and you get into this in the story a little bit, is that if big fund managers are starting to get into the middle market space, kind of go after the same types of assets, do these middle market only fund managers stand a chance? That's an interesting point because obviously, as I mentioned before, three years ago, those large cap funds were exiting the mid-market space. What we see this year is that some large cap funds are reassessing whether the mid-market is a space for them. We saw, for example, Ant and Infrastructure that launched a multi-billion dollar fund within the mid-market space. But when you speak to the mid-market players themselves, they say that they're not really competing with those large cap funds that are kind of launching those mid-cap funds, just because, for example, the mid-market funds are not creating multi-billion dollar funds, yet Ant, for example, created a multi-billion dollar fund. There are a few other things that are important to point out. For example, those large cap funds are going to have to incentivize their team players to not just look at those larger deals that they're usually focused on, but also the mid-cap deals. And that's just going to change the priorities for the team members, where usually it's just more feasible for them to look at large deals, because it makes sense. So I guess they do stand a chance, but it's all going to go back to whether, again, they get the returns they're promising and are able to attract LPs, just because LPs tend to be a bit cautious with first timers, given that they don't have a large track record. Right, right. Okay, that makes sense. Another thing, kind of question that popped out to me in reading this is that you'd said that it can take longer to close these smaller deals that these mid-market funds target than the larger transactions that the big cap funds target. Why is that? Why does it take longer to close these smaller transactions? It's a bunch of factors, really, but it's mainly around resources. So these deals are less intermediated, so due diligence will naturally take longer and negotiations because of the lack of management accounts and data. So just to put a number to this as well, large cap transactions can close in as little as two months. Whereas because of those longer due diligence process and negotiations, the smaller deals can take about nine months to a year or something around that. But mainly, it's an issue of resources, I believe. Right, right. Interesting. Well, let's turn to the climate change investment strategy story now. That's the second link on our post. Demi, same first question. Please tell us about the story and how it came about. Absolutely. So I've been tracking ESG for a while and obviously any source that you speak to in the infrastructure sector, everyone speaks about ESG and how important it is. But the main issue is whether those fund managers or LPs or everyone are walking the talk when it comes to ESG. Flipping around reports that come up recently, I saw one report that states that infrastructure comparing to other alternative asset classes are falling short in ESG commitments. And this made me question again, whether infra fund managers are just talking about ESG or actually implementing strategies where they're disclosing ESG or they're pushing forward with ESG. And that's where I stumbled across the issue of what they call climate change adaptation, which is basically factoring in any climate change impacts into the investment process. So some fund managers are doing that already because they're quite focused on ESG. Their funds are linked to ESG. But other traditional infra investors could be lacking here just because it's a new process for them. So not everyone is equally at blame here. But obviously, this is something that is very important right now, and it's something to consider. It seems like kind of a herd mentality and the herd hasn't started to move in that direction. But it seems so obvious that investors should consider the impacts of potential future climate change on their investments, particularly in infrastructure. Why do you think many don't? I think it boils down to several things. One thing that really plays a role here is cost, to be honest. So when they're creating reports or looking at climate change in general, one thing that they usually do is sometimes they're looking at backward data in terms of the change of temperature rather than future data. And that kind of inhibits how well they're looking at climate change adaptation. Another thing is that if they do factor in any changes in temperature or any climate change impacts, that's obviously going to increase the price of their project compared with those who don't factor it in. So it becomes an issue about competition and winning the project, winning the bid. But I mean, it should be factored in, obviously. And it shouldn't just fall on the shoulders of the info fund managers on their own or their choice. It should be. So there's a lot of talk of whether it should become something more legitimate or called for by governments, for example, in order to ensure that it's being implemented. Interesting. Yes. One thing that occurred to me, you didn't really address this in the story, I don't think. But one thing that occurs to me every time I read a story about ESG, that's that everybody gives lip service to ESG investing, but there are no uniform definitions of what exactly ESG investing means. When do you think that will change? When do you think there will be the same standard that everybody follows? I think that ESG investing across the board. So this is not just infrastructure, but many asset classes don't have a clear definition or a clear uniform definition for what ESG investing is. But obviously, there's a lot of interest in moving in that direction. And I think it's just going to take time because it's quite new and people are just trying to understand what ESG is going to entail and what to add into it. But I think that the EU is moving forward, or maybe they have some sort of first mover status here with their EU taxonomy. So they've created regulations, which are the SFTR regulations, and it basically asks for funds to kind of disclose whether they are related to ESG or not, and disclose certain requirements based on that. And I think if the EU deems successful with those regulations, and infra fund managers are also successful in implementing and disclosing those ESG kind of commitments, then obviously other regions will follow as well. But I think it's a journey. I think they're trying their best to kind of implement ESG here. But with time and once it's like, I think practice makes perfect, and then we'll have a clear definition on what ESG investing is. Well, thank you very much, Demi, for taking the time to discuss these interesting stories. And thank you all for listening to Crossroads. I'm John Whelan, and we'll see you next time.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2021-11-26 14:23:16+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Crossroads podcast: The growing appeal of Europe’s rail leasing sector\n**Episode ID:** 4352\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nHello and welcome to our latest Crossroads podcast. My name is Antonio Fabrizio and I'm a reporter at Information focusing on EMEA transactions. In our podcast today, we'll be discussing why and how infrastructure funds are expanding their presence in the rolling stock sector. We will also see which future developments are expected in the European rail leasing segment. My guests today are Athanasios Zulovits, a partner at Infravia Capital Partners, and Oliver Edgar Muhlem, an investment director at Diff Capital Partners. In September, Infravia launched Next Rail Lease, a new rolling stock lesser focused on Western Europe, and just over a year ago, Diff acquired the stake in Irish Leicester to Axe Rail. I would like to ask our two guests to briefly introduce themselves and talk about what I believe is their first investment in this sector. So can you tell us what was the company rationale for investing in it and how it has evolved since then, starting chronologically with Oliver first and then Athanasios? Thank you, Antonio, for inviting me to the podcast. My name is Oliver Muhlem. I'm an investment director at Diff Capital Partners, and I joined the company almost four and a half years ago and have since then spent most of my time actually in the transportation market. We have started to invest in the intermodal transport market in 2017. And have signed then and closed last year our acquisition of a 49% stake in to Axe Rail Limited, which is an Ireland based leasing company for rail freight wagons that are operated across Europe and in the UK. For us, rail freight or rail in general is really at the backbone of the transportation infrastructure in Europe, and it makes a significant contribution to our daily life. It is a market that enjoys, on the one hand side, a stable economic environment. And for us as an infrastructure investor, it ticks quite a lot of boxes with on the one hand side, its role that it plays in all of our daily lives. And secondly, its stable and predictive business model, which for an infrastructure fund is certainly one of the key investment criterias. Thank you. Athanasios? Yes, thank you. Thank you, Antonio. So I'm Athanasios Zulovits, I'm one of the partners at Infravia and on my day job, I'm an investor on behalf of our infrastructure funds. I am not a transportation specialist. As a matter of fact, I have invested in pretty much all verticals or sub-asset classes of infrastructure over the last eight years since I started. I joined my partners in the firm, but rail has been one of the initiatives, let's say, that I have started working on over the last two, two and a half years. And this has been really a segment for us that has been essentially following the secular trend of energy transition and translating it into the transportation subsector. So we have since the beginning viewed the rail as one of the best ways to find predictable and we will be discussing later probably about that growing demand on the transportation asset class. This has been demonstrated during the COVID period as well. Transportation has in general been heavily affected, rail a lot less so, but even more so demand post-COVID today for rail is probably larger than what it was before. That was the thesis and the next rail was one, in our view, of the best ways of delivering value to our investors by getting involved into the rail space through the setup of a new Roscoe that focuses on a fairly large segment of the rail locomotive leasing space, which to date has been largely untapped from existing Roscoes. Thank you very much. I guess having said this, the next thing that comes to mind is this is not going to be a one-off investment, right? So you guys plan to grow the business, I suppose it will be through organic growth or are you also considering M&As and connected to these basically, there are various countries with different legislation. So do you think some countries have room for improvement, some countries in Europe are more attractive than others? Which ones? Do you want to go first, Athanasios? Sure, thank you. Quite a few things to unpack there, but let me try to start with an easy one. Leasing is a scale business. I mean, there are significant economies of scale to be drawn in this business and therefore growth is in a certain way an obligation of the business model itself. That is not only for rail, that is for any other leasing business, be it planes, be it boxes, all sorts of stuff that infrastructure funds do. So one of the difficulties, I suppose, in this segment is to find the right scale to get involved. And that is one of the most significant barriers of entry at the end of the day for new entrants of starting to come with new equipment in the market. So growth for sure. Now, depending on the thesis of each party, M&A or organic growth is very different. So NexRail is a project that focuses essentially, to put it simply, on the part of the network that is non-electrified. So 50% of our European network is not electrified. A much larger percentage of the network that is actually used by FRET due to the capillarity of the network that you require is non-electrified. And today we are short of locomotion or traction that has the ability to go either uniquely on the non-electrified side or a combination of the electrified and non-electrified network. There are about 15,000 locomotives today, all the locomotives in Europe, that cover that area. And most of them, or over 60% of them, are of an age that they don't meet any more environmental or even safety norms. There's going to be a huge replacement need to start with, and that part is going to be more about the product. Now, you mentioned countries before. We need to realize that the leasing business is also about having access to clients. And sometimes that is local, that is not access that is a multi-country. And therefore M&A could make sense when you have synergies to create with a business, particularly on covering more client base. Because otherwise, buying old locomotives today just to have scale, be it electric or non-electric locomotives, is not necessarily the best use of capital in a context when you have such huge replacement needs in the European railway space. Perfect. Thank you so much. And Oliver, if you want to add to this, and maybe also comment more generally about competition, we've seen some movement there over the past couple of years. So what's your view as well? Yeah. I think the rail market is a truly European market, especially for railcars, because a railcar can basically run in every country. Therefore, as a railcar lessor, you are not necessarily linked to certain countries, but the most valuable asset that you have is your access to your customers. As Athanasios already said, I think the European rail market benefits from quite some momentum these days. On one hand side, you have an increasing transport volume. On the other hand, the share of leased assets increases. At the same time, large state owned incumbents lose more and more business so that you have more private players, which typically favorite leasing solutions over ownership of assets. So that sets the scene for growth in the coming years. The key advantage that we have at Truax Rail Limited is that we are one of the leading leasing companies in the intermodal market segment, which is by far the largest rail transportation segment. Therefore, we benefit from a unique access to clients, which obviously helps us to drive growth organically, but also gives us opportunity for portfolio acquisitions or M&A deals. Looking at the competition overall, I think it's fair to say that the rail market has attracted a lot of investors in recent weeks and months, as you can see from the transactions that have closed over the last 12 to 18 months. But ultimately, the market hasn't really changed that much because it is a market with a pretty high barrier to entry. So in the rail car leasing market, it's extremely difficult to start a business from scratch. In the locomotive market, that's different, clearly. And therefore, the names of the owners might have changed. And of course, every investment investment company, there's investment in the rail industry wants to grow its platform. But given the positive dynamics of the markets, this has not led so far and I don't expect it will lead to a deterioration of the investment environment. Okay, thank you very much. I suppose we can we can move on to a macro picture now just to see what's happening at European level. And obviously, the things that come to mind for me are, you mentioned the pandemic, but how has the pandemic impacted the sector and what's what's like or not impacted the sector and what do you expect in the months to come? And regarding the legislation, so the EU introduced the so called EU rail packages, which is basically legislation to aimed to create this single rail area across Europe. And how does this translate into an opportunity for infrafunds? You know, are governments doing enough? Well, the answer is probably they never do enough. But the question is, to what extent is government support actually needed? Starting with the beginning of your question, I think the impact of COVID-19 was was surprisingly for most of us probably very positive because it has shown how reliable rail transport actually is. If you compare the transport volumes realized during COVID-19 with pre COVID volumes, then you see that the volumes have remained constant. So we haven't seen a sharp decline in transportation volumes. Why? Because rail transport is a very efficient way in moving goods from A to B. And therefore, it has rather put rail in the spotlight, and has led to a positive momentum because now everybody understands on one hand side, that rail market is reliable. And at the same time, you have the political ambitions and the pressure from the public and from industry companies to move towards a more sustainable way of transporting goods. And that's the momentum we see right now. And what we also see is that in the past, the market participants tended to say, okay, government has to provide more support to allow rail to play a more important role. But what we see now is the growth in the industry is primarily driven by industrial companies that aim to reduce the carbon footprint of their logistics supply chain. So we see more and more customers approaching us with ideas to move their transport from road to rail, or to favor rail transport over other transportation modes. You see ports, like the port of Antwerp, who has announced to double its rail transport in the next 10 years. And in my view, we are going to see the industry that will make a lot of progression. But politics will run behind that, of course, more support is always helpful. But I think we've reached a point where the momentum is clearly with the companies, with the rail operators, etc. And we don't need to wait for more regulation or more subsidies. Thank you very much. And that's very, very interesting. And so, Atanasis, if you would like to add anything also on this, you know, intermodal model, or, you know, which model is the future, perhaps? Antonio, just to specify that we're talking about the rail fret, of course, historically, at least in the traction side, the biggest part had been the passenger rail segment. And there, the impact is not the same of COVID, of course, or on open access networks. I mean, there has been an impact, for sure. On the freight side, it's positive. On the passenger side, question mark. Now, on the traction side of things, or locomotives, which I am clearly, you know, positioned to speak about in this podcast. I must admit that we have to be realistic, rail has been the big loser versus trucks for the last 30 years. It's incomparable, the growth of trucking over the last 30 years compared to rail that has become a marginal part of how we transport goods versus what it should have been in the past. That has been, to a certain extent, because passenger rail was favoured. But even there, passenger rail lost compared to plane. And the second part is that there has been a general protectionist, I would suppose, approach towards protecting national incumbents in every single country of Europe, and not only France, or not only Germany. And liberalisation has not led to market growth yet. There are many reasons for that. I'm not sure it's regulation at the end of the day. It's how regulation is applied. The rules are there, and they're good. And right now, even track access, which has been one of the important bottlenecks in the past of saying, oh, rail is so expensive because we pay so much for network. This has been improved now, both in Germany, in France, in most other countries. But we need to be realistic. Most industrial sites in Europe have stopped having, or have removed their historical rail links to favour tracking. That, hopefully, is something that could grow the pie. Now, our investments as infrastructure funds today are working more on replacement needs and growth of the existing, rather than a significant gain of market share, which is obviously possible, likely, but we need to make sure that it happens. And how will that happen? First of all, it will happen when we incorporate the externalities, the cost of the externalities that less carbon, you know, and other emission-friendly modes of locomotion, or of traction, or of transportation, provide the proper cost for that. And they don't today. There's no carbon tax on tracking today. There should be. That's one of the things that it's an obvious one. The next point is that on rail, because it is a safety-first environment, more than, I mean, equally as planes, there has been a general sclerosis about how we implement rules that are supposed to make the European network more harmonised. And that has a bigger role on traction compared to railcars, for sure. But today, even though we're supposed to have harmonised signalling systems, we are ending up in some sort of form where we will have 27 different interpretations of the harmonised system, and you still need the 27 tomologations. So those are implementation is key, and implementation to date is probably left too much on national, you know, implementation and interpretations, rather than centralised harmonisation. That is one key area that could change, to foster more rail as a percentage of total transport movements, because we're still not, with the exception of COVID, when there was a gain of market share, it has been historically, in most countries, losing share. We are hopefully in a transition and in a change of that paradigm. And if that is the case, for sure, then we will all be extremely happy, because we will have resilience on one side, and that exists, and it is true that it exists, but even more potential for growth. And that's exactly why we chose a lot of us, I presume, to position ourselves in this segment now, versus three years ago, not necessarily because it was called the 2021 year of rail, if you see what I mean. Yes, yes. Okay, so there is room for improvement in terms of legislation, for sure. Applying the rules, I would say, is, I mean, we had this discussion at the moment, as we speak, about, you know, what are the conclusions of COP26. The issue is not the objectives, which are important to have them, and they are there. The issue is how do we implement in such a way that it accelerates the trend, and that, candidly, is not necessarily up to the level that we could, in order to make that positive momentum that comes from demand, as it was correctly pointed out before, from the need to decarbonize supply chains into more demand for services of our products. You know, you've basically introduced the last point, which I think is the most central issue at the moment. It's the energy transition and the shift to sustainability. So, I suppose, you know, for everyone in this industry, in the rail industry now, reducing emissions has gone up to the very top of their agenda. Now, coming to your investments, specifically, how do you plan to do that? How will your investment support these efforts and improve sustainability? And, I guess, this goes both on, this can be applied to Axe Rail and to Next Rail, so on the locomotive front, on the freight segment. So, who wants to start? I'm happy to go for that, if you want. So, as I said before, the big issue here is rail is already, you're investing in carbon avoidance, whatever is the, even with a very, very old, 50-year-old diesel locomotives, you are avoiding CO2 and other emissions much more compared to putting the equivalent number of tracks on the road. So, the rail is at the heart of CO2 avoidance by nature. Having said that, in order to be competitive towards tracking, you need to be able to offer good capillarity of the network, not necessarily last, a real last mile in the cities, because that, let's be realistic, we will never be able to replace the white van with a train or a rail car, but to get as close as possible to that last mile and let alone to get to the single factory sitting somewhere, loading intermodally its container and collecting it and transporting it through a port. To do that, we cannot electrify the entire network of Europe. I mean, this is impossible. So, we need to be able to, or what we did was take a view that there are solutions which are within sustainability objectives of taking thermal engines, investing in them in a newer product, hybrid locomotion with batteries, and taking a journey over the next five to seven years, which will combine carbon-neutral solutions like synthetic fuels and biofuels, and will lead into carbon zero emissions, but from now, not to wait for the name when it arrives in 10 years, from now, to start working on hydrogen applications for freight, and therefore, tackle the biggest issue, which is our 16,000 non-fully electric locomotives going and picking up the cargo where it cannot be fully electrified, either by design or by a lack of economic rationale in a route that is used once every week to invest 10 million per kilometer in electrification, which is not happening in any country. So, that is why being in rail in the first place is investing in sustainability, and our view through Next Rail, which is being in rail in the segment that has the biggest potential for impact in decarbonizing even the traction, is an even more virtuous and impactful journey, and this is where we believe we can deliver, as in Ferbia, value-add for our clients, the sector, and ultimately capture the early mover, rather than first mover, premium of having scale in a segment that people are trying to avoid, even though this is the core of the issue here, to be able to increase the percentage of rail versus trucks, and not the mainline route, which is already fully electrified, and goes from the port of Hamburg to Hungary. Yeah, perfect. Oliver, if you want to add something on decarbonization, and also on this whole issue about hydrogen applications, what would you say? Yeah, so first of all, I would agree to what Athanasios said. I think an investment in the rail industry as such is already a support of an environmental-friendly way of transporting goods, and with respect to railcar leasing, I mean, a railcar as such doesn't have any greenhouse gas emissions. This is obvious, but there is not only the question of the direct emissions, but also indirect, in the sense that you always have to ask yourself, what are the goods that you actually want to transport, right? So we can transport oil, gas, coal, et cetera. Tuax is a player that is clearly focused on intermodal business, and the way we can support the attempt of our customers to become even more environmental- friendly is to get more and more involved in their logistics supply chain, and make sure that we supply them with the right wagons to allow them to move away from road transport wherever that's possible. And Athanasios is right. On the last mile, trucking is pretty flexible and dynamic. That's not the key field for competition of rail. It's rather the long-term, long-distance transport. Outside of our investment at Tuax Rail Ltd., we see a number of opportunities, and we are currently working on a number of opportunities that tackle exactly the, let's say, lack of electrification of the European rail network, as Athanasios described it. Because now you have occasions where on certain routes that are partially electrified and partially non-electrified, you might find diesel locomotives running under catenary and running over electrified routes, which hurts to say that, basically. And that's why there are a couple of initiatives where the idea is to focus or to replace diesel-powered locomotives on long distances by alternative traction power, which can be provided by hydrogen, for example. And this is something, what I mentioned earlier, where you can take two approaches. On the one hand side, you can wait for the government to make available a kind of infrastructure for hydrogen, or you try to team up with the right partners, which might include OEMs, energy majors, industrial companies, etc. And you approach it rather from a kind of project perspective, where you start with well-defined use cases. And out of these use cases, you grow your business case and you grow and expand geographically and in terms of value chain and transport service that you can offer. So this is clearly something that we see and where I believe that the industry will apply innovative solutions much quicker than any government will be able to provide the required infrastructure or to release respective supporting measures. Okay, thank you so much. I think we can wrap this up just with a very brief final remark from both of you on where it would be good to see the industry 10 years from now, just to conclude this. Athanasios? Well, I'm not sure I'm such a visionary and so experienced in the sector to tell you exactly where the industry should be. But what I can say is that it is pretty obvious that rail is a good way of moving people and cargo around our continent, which has never been as unified as it is over the last 10 years. So rail is what started the industrial revolution and it's lost the steam. So I would like to see this take a more central role compared to what it has been put on the sidelines over the past two years. I would also like to hope that now that the compass has been set and societal claims have become finally more at the forefront of where economic actors are ready to act in terms of sustainability, that we can be positioned well to offer a wider range of solutions to be able to make rail more relevant and within the complexities of the technicalities at the end of the day, offer as lessors multiple solutions to our clients for dual modes, single modes, all sorts of modes of relevant traction to be able to accomplish what we require, which is much more goods and people to be moved around by rail rather than by road or plane at the end of the day. Yeah, I think you've asked a billion euro question. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball. But I think that in 10 years from now, the rail market will be much more agile, much more flexible. We see that state incumbents struggle with a service offering, which is not very flexible, not really oriented on the needs of the customers. And you see more and more privately owned companies, operators, leasing companies that provide mobility solutions rather than offering pure rail solutions in a sense that it's not always about rail against road. It is also about finding the right mix between them, offering more flexible rail transport, supporting emission friendly transportation solutions. And I think in 10 years from now, we will see an industry that delivers as it delivers today, a stable way of transporting, but which has become much more common in a sense that it will be easier for logistic companies to really make use of the advantages of rail, which is a potential that is nearly untapped today. All very interesting. So thank you so much, Athanasios and Oliver for this insightful contribution. Thank you. Thank you, Antonio. Thank you, Oliver. Thank you, Antonio. Thanks, Athanasios. So thank you to everyone for listening to our podcast. If you'd like to know more, please check our website, follow us on social media, comment, like and share, and look out for our next podcast. Thank you very much and have a good day.

My name is Robin Ganguly, and I'm the Asia-Pacific head of content for InfraLogic Information and SparkSpread. I have with me also Rohan Sharma, our South Asia reporter based in Mumbai. It is our privilege today to host one of India's most prominent and dynamic policymakers, a man who has vowed to tackle red tape, reduce delays, and modernize the nation's road sector. And many say he is well on his way to achieving those goals. This is, of course, Mr. Nitin Gadkari, India's keenly watched Minister for Road Transport and Highways. Mr. Minister, a very, very warm welcome to the program. Thank you. To set the stage, sir, could you give us an insight into your vision for India's road sector in the next five and ten years? In the next five years, we plan to develop around 60,000 kilometers of highways under Bharat Mala Phase 1 and Phase 2, with an overall capital expenditure of more than 20 lakh crores. Already in Bharat Mala first phase, we have already started the work of 20,000 kilometers. This is already under construction. Now in Gati Shakti, the scheme which is already launched by the Prime Minister, we are already there. The Prime Minister has given us a mandate to increase the national highway length from 1,47,000 kilometers to 2,00,000 kilometers. And Bharat Mala 2 is in the research stage. We are in the preparation stage. And 100 percent, we will be planning for that. And it is going to change the total scenario of road infrastructure in the country. My aim is, my mission is to make Indian road of that standards, which equivalent to USA within five years. And that is exactly the mission. And we are trying for that. We are also to monetize road of the tune of rupees more than 3 lakh crores. Through various modes of monetization, out of this approximately rupees 25,000 crore already realized. And the process has already started. And we are getting very good response from the investor. In the next 10 years, India will have a world-class network roads and highways with the completion of Bharat Mala scheme and overall Bharat Mala Priyojana. And after that, it will going to be changed the total scenario of road infrastructure in the country. We are giving the highest priority for development of hilly area, particularly the hilly states. And we are giving priority for northeast, that is Arunachal, Meghalaya, Tripura, Assam, because they are socially, economically, educationally backward. We are giving special priority for Jammu and Kashmir. We have already started making of tunnels, roads, highway, at least of 1 lakh crore in Jammu and Kashmir. And we are making also roads in Uttarakhand, Himachal, everywhere. And we are making 22 green express highways. That is very important by which that is connectivity to the port, airports will be easy. It is going to reduce the logistic cost. And that is really very much important for the Indian economy, for the growth. At the same time, as a transport minister, we are also trying to connect our road network, not only to the capital or district places, but we want to develop tourism. We are making already completed the project of Bhagavan Gautam Buddha circuit that costing 20,000 crore. We are now on Ram Janaki circuit, that is also very important. We are also making our connectivity to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and particularly, which is very important, by road connectivity, we can connect it to the different parts of the world. So, I am confident that the integration between road, waterways, sea transport, aviation, and railway, by which this Gati Shakti Yojana will give new boost up to our infrastructure. We are already making 100 airports, and the things are moving very fast. I am confident that India is going to be emerged as one of the important countries as far as the infrastructure is concerned. And I am confident that our infrastructure will be landmark, and which will be within five years, which will be equivalent to USA. And that is exactly our target and dream. And we are doing very, very seriously strong efforts for completing the dream of our Prime Minister about Atmandir Bar Bharat. Thank you, Mr. Minister. That's excellent. And, you know, this strikes a personal chord with me, because when you say the Northeast, I grew up in a place called Darjeeling. And my colleague, Rohan, he's from Assam. And, you know, your mention of the USA. So, I've also heard that, you know, somewhere in your office, there hangs a sign which says, roads build the country rather than the other way around. You know, your program that you've mentioned. So, you've said in the past that you would like foreign capital to fund road construction. How do you plan to attract foreign investors for greenfield projects? Because they seem to be interested mostly in operational assets. In November 2020, we revised the model consistent agreement for hybrid NUT mode in order to make the risk sharing mechanism more favorable for the private sector. It has addressed issues regarding change in ownership, exit option, shifting of utilities and maintenance during construction period, financial close and payment during construction period, applicable bank rate and mobilization advance, termination payment and dispute resolution. NHI has also revamped the BOT toll model so that private sector customers are interested in investing in BOT toll projects as well. A revised MCA has addressed the issues regarding project preparation and conditions, precedents, dispute resolution and limitation of liability, ease of doing business, incorporation of new policies such as policy for harmonious substitution, policy for resolution of stuck projects and other miscellaneous reform such as use of latest technology for traffic and road condition monitoring. Overall, we are planning to develop specialized classes of investor in the country like institutional investors, construction agencies, toll collection agencies, operation and maintenance agencies who can combine their expertise to offer the best solution to the Indian road sector. And I also feel that there is a huge opportunity for pension fund or insurance fund because in the dollar the return which you are getting as compared with we can offer you the fixed return. We can give you the fixed return and NHI is a AAA rating and strong our toll income is 40,000 crore presently and within five years it will go up to 1,40,000 crore. Even some of the investor if they need we can make the extra account and I am confident that it is a golden opportunity for investor to get good returns in investing in road infrastructure. Now we are making trying to find out the solution that because the hedging is from my ministry it will be difficult for me I need approval from the reserve bank and finance ministry. But any fund if they want to take the risk on hedging basis, if they want to invest in India 100% it is really a golden opportunity and my suggestion to all of you that if you have any new suggestion, new model by which we can attract this investment we will encourage the people. Presently the Indian banks, Indian institutions are giving good response. We do not have any shortage of money for infrastructure, road infrastructure. We are getting good response from the all our model hybrid NOT, BOT every type of model we are getting good response from the investor and I am confident there will be no shortage as far as the resources are concerned for road infrastructure in India. Thank you very much Mr. Gadkari. My colleague Rohan is going to ask you the next question. Rohan go ahead. Sure, thank you Robin. In the last few months bidding to develop projects has become very aggressive in EPC definitely but also in HAM and we have seen very many small players for the first time because of all the changes that have been made in the bidding norms sometime back. They are also now eligible to bid and they are bidding and they are becoming very aggressive with 10 percent difference to NHI estimates as compared to 25 to 30 percent last year. The difference between now and last time when bidding was aggressive is that industry professionals are now talking about it and they are fearful of a repeat of the previous scenario what happened. Is there a recognition also in the government that something needs to be done to curb this or how are you looking at it? Actually we have learned the lesson from the adverse situation which are witnessed during the early part of last decade. The contract have been restructured in such a manner to ensure appropriate risk allocation and fair distribution of responsibilities between the parties. We have been in regular touch with the bankers and we have advised that they should refrain from funding projects which according to them won't be viable on account of aggressive bidding by the bidder and I feel that there is a competition. We are transparent, time bound, result oriented and corruption free. So, at the same time it is the opportunity for everybody and we are very open for any change. So, always we are interacting with the stakeholders and whatever the good suggestion from them we are always ready to consider all the suggestions and recommendation given by the stakeholders. So, we are constantly in the process and I feel that we are getting good response and every day by the system we are improving the system and I am confident that if any people like you, if you want to suggest something 100% we will work on that and we will think how to make more perfection in the system. You know, that's a really refreshing outlook. I am based in Hong Kong and I meet lots of infrastructure investors from the US, from Europe and also from the Asia Pacific and we shall pass this message on. Mr. Gadkari, the next question is, the Indian government in August announced an $81 billion privatization pipeline for the next four years of which I understand that roads will account for about $20-21 billion. What will be your strategy for asset monetization? Will you transfer more profitable toll projects to the NHEI for bigger investors and bid out smaller projects in TOT to domestic companies? What is the view that foreign investors should take especially since many of them say they seem to want larger projects? The main objective with respect to asset monetization is to make funds available for facilitating infrastructure creation in the future. My ultimate aim with this exercise is to ensure maximum possible realization of funds through monetization of the assets. In this regard, our strategy will be to identify good quality monetizable assets, conduct preliminary analysis to zero down on the mode of monetization, that is toll operate transfer, inbid or securitization and the packaging of the bundles and finally taking the necessary measures for running the procurement process in a smooth and timely manner. The foreign investors and domestic investors should consider investing in both TOT and INVID based on their current analysis of the project bundles. We are also looking to revise our INVID strategy to allow smaller investors to participate in the instrument. And I am confident that the small investor 100% will give good response. In the Indian capital market, actually presently the interest rate on deposits is compared with the previous year, it is now reducing. So by giving the fixed assurance to the small investors, we can get good attractive investment in the road infrastructure. Our cooperative bank, urban cooperative bank, then our carbon cooperative societies, they have got the huge fund is available. And now our idea is to take all this fund for using infrastructure in the country. And they will get good return because as far as the deposit rate is concerned, we will give 2%, 3% more than that. So first of all, in India, it is the time for all of us to develop insurance economy, pension economy and share economy. As far as the world is concerned, it is the time for Indian economy to develop all these three sectors very rapidly. And we are now developing the habit in the mind of the people to invest in the share economy, in the capital market. And NHI has got a tremendous huge opportunities by which the small people can invest and they will get good returns. But at the same time, we are keenly interested. Already the 100% FDI allowed in infrastructure with direct route, there is no problem. And even some of the investor, if they are ready to invest in NHI, I am ready to sit with them to find out the option. My only thing is that the dollar-rupees fluctuation, but presently the growth rate is good. Now it is up to you, people like you to take the decision at the time of the investment, whether it need hedging or not. But at the same time, I feel that Indian economy is day by day becoming a stronger economy. So there is a huge opportunity to investment in India. And I will request you, even for that, if the direct investment of people are ready with NHI, we can think about any other new model, which anyone have, already have some proposal for that, we are ready to consider. And we will think on that line to make it possible that they can invest in India. Just a quick follow-up question. So, you know, if somebody does have a suggestion, you mentioned this a few times, and like I said, it's a very refreshing view. So, somebody does have, you know, the KKR, BlackRocks, etc. of the world, if they do have a suggestion, who should they send it to? Actually, my suggestion is one way to give it to NHI chairman and other is the one copy give to minister, as a minister to me, to my private secretary, and we can work on it, and we can call them, we can discuss them, and we will 100%, whatever the appropriate thing we need to implement for that, we will think and we will consider on that. Thank you. Following up on that, how many TOT bundles are expected by the end of this fiscal year through March 2022? And what is the value of projects planned for transfer to the INVIT in the next round, if you could give us some idea? As on that, NHI has already invited the bids for TOT bundles 6, 7 and 8. The bidding process is underway, and the bidders are conducting the necessarily due diligence in connection with the investment in these bundles. We have already started due diligence on 45 road stretches to develop a complete pipeline of projects to be monetized. And I am confident that 100%, we will expect a good response from the investor. Now, also the good thing is that the Indian investors are also taking interest in TOT mode. That is exactly again a good thing for us. So, our idea is to make the small size of bundle by which they can afford to invest in infrastructure in the country. Just moving on to technology, if you could just tell us, what are the plans to develop charging infrastructure as your ministry has also been seeing as giving a boost to electric vehicles? Are you planning any PVPs for this sector? In order to promote EVs, it has been made compulsory to include EV charging station at the wayside amenities. We are making 350 wayside amenities. In this year, NHI has awarded 39 contracts for development of wayside amenities across the country, in which inclusion of EV charging stations is compulsory. And in the next five years, it is planned to develop wayside amenities at more than 600 locations, all of which having the necessary EV charging infrastructure. The Department of Heavy Industries awarded the work of establishment of EV charging stations for 16 national highway and expressways to Energy Efficiency Services Limited. In this regard, EESL has entered in a move with NHI in order to facilitate the establishment of EV charging stations. As on date, EESL is conducting feasibility studies to identify the specific location on the highways and expressway for setting up a charging station. So, 100% there is a huge opportunity. Now, the public places like malls, like bus stations, railway stations, parking places, then offices, everywhere, there is a great opportunity for making electric charging stations. And the most important thing is now either for EV vehicle, two-wheeler or four-wheeler, the charging, already charging equipment is already is given by the company, manufacturing company to the consumer. So, he can make the charging in his house also. So, there are some people, they have solar charging system on the rooftop. So, they can use that solar power for charging also. So, there is a different initiative taken by the different type of people. And our priority is to maximum use of solar power for EV vehicle. And that is exactly to be import substitute, cost-effective, pollution-free and indigenous. In our power basket, the 38% of the power is from solar power. So, to increase more production for green energy, exactly that is the priority for our country. Thank you, Mr. Gadkari. Finally, one quick question. You know, from your perspective, from what you see, what do you think, is there a message that you'd like to send out, like overall message that you'd like to send out to foreign investors looking to invest in India? Indian economy is the fastest growing economy. And Indian infrastructure is changing every day. India has got the maximum young, talented engineering power available in the country. We have got a different type of industry, the raw material which is available. And Indian economy is now, the growth rate is high. And our exports are also increasing. And that is the reason I will appeal all the investors that India is the best destiny for investment. And exactly as far as the road infrastructure is concerned, it is a golden opportunity. You can check the credentials, you can check the performance of our road sector anywhere in the country or in the whole world. Our 100%, our construction rate is now very good. When I take on my charge as a minister, it was coming to two kilometers per day. And presently, it is 38 kilometers per day. We have already have two, three world record. We have constructed 2.5 kilometer four lane cement concrete road in Delhi-Mumbai highway near Vadodara within 24 hours. Then we have constructed one 26 kilometer bitumen road in Sulapur-Vijaypur section in 22 hours. These are the world record. We are the highest road construction, 38 kilometer per day in national highway. This is also the world record. So, the quality and the construction rate and the phase in which we are using technology, 100%, I'm confident that we are equivalent to international standards. And that is the reason that I'm going to appeal to all the stakeholders that Indian road infrastructure industry, the sector is one of the attractive sector. And I'm welcoming all of you to invest in India. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also very friendly for foreign investment. And we are welcoming all the stakeholders to come to India and invest India. Mr. Gadkari, thank you so much. That was like really an educational and interesting conversation. Thank you once again from all of us at Infralogic Information and Sparks Road for speaking to us. And I personally look forward to meeting you in person when I am in India next. Thank you very, very much, Mr. Minister.

My name is Rory Galavan and I'm a mergers and acquisitions reporter for information covering the UK and Scandinavia. Today we're going to be discussing the future of Altnets in the UK. Altnets is an industry term for new telecom companies that are challenging the incumbent operators, which are BT OpenReach and Virgin Media, in the rollout of fibre and wireless networks in the UK. My guests today are James Haraway, who is a managing director at InfraCapital, and Peter Bachmann, who is a managing director at Gresham House. InfraCapital and Gresham House have several investments in UK Altnets, and James and Peter have been closely involved in these. So before we start talking about the future of the sector, I thought I would start by asking the guests to tell us about how they came to invest in Altnets and what their main investment criteria were as they looked for companies to back. So starting chronologically with InfraCapital, James, could you give us a brief introduction into when InfraCapital started investing in the sector and how things have developed since then? We made our first Altnet investment in 2014, when we acquired the leading rural Altnet GigaClear. We came to the sector from a background of investing in core infrastructure assets. For example, we held investments in two water companies, which are natural monopolies by virtue of the prohibitively high cost to replicate. We saw some similar characteristics in fibre networks, particularly in rural areas. At its most simple, we saw a demand supply imbalance in the UK. On the demand side, consumers were needing increasingly fast broadband connections to work from home, stream, game. And businesses needed faster and more reliable connectivity to support the move of storage of data and applications into the cloud. On the supply side, the existing telecoms infrastructure owners were not investing in fibre, creating the Altnet opportunity. We've continued to support GigaClear as it's grown, making a series of further investments since the initial 2014 investment. And we've acquired four further Altnets in the UK, three fibre to the home businesses, focus on being the leading Altnet in their respective geographies. We also acquired 50% of what was SSE Telecoms, now rebranded NEOS Networks alongside SSE. This is a large Altnet focus on wholesale and business customers, which we're attracted to because of its significant nationwide fibre network. You asked about our main investment criteria. It's fair to say those have evolved over time, but a key criteria is geography. And we've invested in businesses which have an existing presence in their respective regions with a real potential to be the leading Altnet in that region. These aren't the kind of investments where you sit back and wait for the wind to blow or the sun to shine. They're hands-on and operational, particularly on delivery of bills. And as such, the capability of management teams is critical. And we've looked for teams that have shown that they can do it. And then finally, paying customers. Okay, that's obviously quite an important criteria. Does that mean if you're buying a fibre network, you're not just interested in how many homes it's passed, but how many people are actually signing up to the network? Exactly right. Of course, the homes passed metric shows you what the potential number of maximum customers is. And the point is that if you've built your network past a home, if you can sign that customer up, then you can secure their revenue. But until you sign that customer up, you've got no revenue. So it's really important to look at the number of homes connected to a network, i.e. paying customers. Just very quickly, you mentioned GigaClear and then four further fibre investments. Could you just briefly talk us through them in terms of which geographies they're in? Yeah, of course. As I said, three of them are fibre-to-the-home businesses. And they're focused on becoming the leading outlets in their respective regions. So Fibrous is in Northern Ireland. Spectrum, which has recently been rebranded as Oggy in South Wales. And White Fibre, which is on the Isle of Wight. Peter, is take-up a very important consideration for Gresham House as well? It absolutely is. And just to use an analogy back in the day, in the solar and renewable sector, we used to talk about a phenomenon of Braggawatts, where people would big up the amount of pipeline they had. And we're starting to see, or we were seeing a similar syndrome in the Altnet space, where we used to talk about a focus on Hail Mary homes, where we have seen, and we have very good authority, that there are some regional Altnets out there. For example, one of them had 38,000 premises passed, but only 198 paying customers. For us, we take it a completely different way. Customers connected is absolutely key. Our simple logic is there's not really much point in having a network unless someone's using it. So we completely buy the argument that continual growth of household data demand will eventually push everyone onto a gigabit network. We really do focus, prefer a focus on real customers. And furthermore, just to extend that, in a lot of the areas that we're focused on with our Altnets, which are into the rural areas, which are really the hard to reach areas that typically are very badly served by the incumbent networks, they also typically bring with them a voucher, and to actually claim the voucher, you ultimately need to get that customer signed up. So this whole concept of Hail Mary homes of the past, we think will quieten down, and really, except for commercial build markets, take up really is key. All right. Gresham House, I think, is a more recent investor in the sector, and I wondered if you could just talk us through how you started looking at it, and how things have evolved since then. So look, I'll probably go just a little step earlier than that. So I'd been looking at the sector since about 2016. And I think like James had seen that this is very much the next utility, a fourth utility, you might call it, in people's homes and businesses. And at the time in my previous job, I'd spent a lot of time working with a couple of quite nascent venture stage Altnets. And unfortunately, I couldn't get the IC of my previous firm to proceed with them, because they were looking at other VC opportunities and probably saw higher returns. But yeah, I did watch on with immense frustration as all of these Altnets have actually gone on to become household names with matching valuations. So when I joined Gresham House, I made the Altnets, and what I call a digital inclusion thematic, a priority sector for us. And for us, really, our sustainability fund, the Bridge Sustainable Infrastructure Fund, is focusing on what we call data connectivity as being a really key plank to any holistic sustainability strategy. And that's really why we call it digital inclusion, because really, without good broadband, we couldn't be doing something like this today, we can't do any of the other remote health, remote learning. And more particularly, we can't do some of the more important things around resource efficiency, for example, in advanced farming techniques. So we really think digital inclusion is at the centre of everything. We also think that over the last few years, and certainly, since the time that James has been talking about, we've seen the market mature. We've seen that the markets become a lot more investable, particularly with the maturing of the whole construction and delivery side of the market, where we've now seen the cost of connections coming down to a point where a lot of places that perhaps weren't previously within reach now become affordable. And that also is a key factor that has helped us drive towards this market. But overarching all of that, in our view, gigabit broadband really is a once in a generation opportunity in that it is the final solution for any country that it gets rolled out. And it is infinitely upgradable. So as a business area, we think this is a hugely important and a very attractive long term investment. As to what we're actually looking for, like James, I guess, geography is key. We've typically looked for areas that were relatively underserved by the incumbent. And by underserved, I meant typically looking for places that were probably connected through ADSL, or quite long run fibre to the cabinet type connections, which typically translate to sub 20, and even sometimes sub 10, and even sub five megabits per second. So really not up to scratch to what people want. And our view was that if you get into the right places, you could create quasi monopolistic type networks and, and ultimately offer a much better value proposition to our customers and than what they could otherwise get. We also think that there is this copper switch off opportunity over the next decade. And that will obviously then make regional selection and the incumbent network really important. So that's something we look at. But broadly, if we're into a rural network, and we've particularly if we've been funded by vouchers, we think that that does put you in a very good position with respect to any other future risks around overbuild. And then beyond that, not dissimilar to what James talked about for us, yeah, the next really key things after selection of location is that the company that you're going to be investing in has an appropriate scale of initial network, a strong delivery base from which they could work from. And then ultimately great teams, as anyone will know in the space, it's really down to the people and you need really high quality teams. And once we found those things, great region, good initial base and great teams, we then look to scale those up. So in terms of the investments that we've made Rory, we've backed Wildernet, which is focused on the really hard to reach parts of Cornwall, and the southwest border link, which is focused on the equally hard to reach parts of the Scottish borders. And most recently, we backed a business called Telcom, which is focused more on the B2B and the MD office block sectors with what they consider to be a full stack offering. And our medium term goal is to bring all of these businesses under a Gresham House Internet Group structure to create a near national network. Okay, thank you very much both for those introductions. I'd like to turn to the future now, which is the subject of this podcast. So I think currently about 20% of homes in the UK have been passed by full fibre networks. So that obviously leaves quite a lot of room for more investment as this figure rises. But at the same time, although there are probably more than 100 Altnets, I think a lot of them have already attracted investment from infrastructure funds and other investors. So I wondered if you thought whether there are still a lot of opportunities for you and other infrastructure investors to invest in young Altnets that have not attracted major investment already? Or are we perhaps more likely to see follow on investments in companies that are already backed by infrastructure funds? I'll hand that one over to you, James, if that's okay. So from InfraCapital's perspective, our primary focus is to continue to support and grow our existing platforms to achieve their goals. It's not to say we won't look for further investments, but across our five assets, we've got some great management teams and some great platforms and we can continue to support them to achieve their goals. On the wider market, there's been a great wave of investment in UK Altnets with the aggregate amount of announced plans significantly exceeding the number of households in the UK. And we know that the incumbent telcos that you previously mentioned, Rory, have now very much woken up. BT Openreach are now upgrading their network to fibre at pace. And the combined Virgin Media O2 has announced that they will upgrade their entire cable network to fibre and potentially seek a partner to build more network. So over the next few years, it feels like the significant majority of premises in the UK will have a fibre connection without any more alternative network providers being founded. In terms of the opportunities for us, we think we'll soon see winners and losers amongst the Altnets with one of the key success factors being the ability to build network and then to penetrate network, that is to actually get customers onto it. And some Altnets won't succeed in that and others may not achieve necessary scale. And so it's some consolidation that we think will be the next wave of transactions. Very interesting. Can I just follow up on that? So in terms of the losers, it might be a company who starts building a network and passes quite a few homes, but then runs out of money or something. So would they end up getting taken over by competitors or being sold in a fire sale or something like that? I think if a business ran out of money, then yes, it would likely be taken over by a bigger competitor. I'll maybe just pass the question over to Peter as well. Yeah, sure. So look, we're a UK focused platform. So I'll focus on that. And obviously, if we want to delve into some other geographies, we can afterwards. But as you mentioned, Rory, there are around 100 Altnets. Our view is that probably most of the credible Altnets have probably already secured funding by now. And the ones that are left are quite marginal and very regionally specific and therefore relatively small. And it's probably questionable as to whether they hold any further appeal. Although that being said, we saw a relatively small business taken over by one of our Altnet peers this week. So there is probably still some small transactions to be had. But particularly with most of the regional players focused on the Project Gigabit or F20 program run by BDUK, none of those Altnets can really bid into them without a proper financial backer. So anything that's left without a backer right now, I think will struggle to prosper over the next few years. So I think probably most of the existing Altnets have probably got their money. And I think most of the bets have been placed, call it that. I think probably the next major opportunity for investment is when that winner or loser type scenario is sorted out. And I think once the Project Gigabit winners are announced, you will start to see potentially some further opportunities for funding. So at that point, you'll see quite a lot of these Altnets, particularly if they're winning type B type lots, then you will get, I think, quite attractive opportunities to deploy further capital into the space. And then really once that's all done, I think the next interesting opportunity is probably once all of the Project Gigabit lots have been done, which is probably around 2025, where at that stage, I could imagine there to be quite a large consolidation wave to come to the market, where there's probably going to be a lot of people looking to try to either hoover up the regionally specific networks, where you might get someone like your BT Openreach, Virgin, City Fiber, those types of large wholesale owners looking to aggregate. Or you might look to see a number of the Altnets looking to join up to create a genuine national alternative network to some of the BT Openreaches of the world. As for the crowded point, I think probably the more crowded point actually is some of the nuts and bolts of the business, and that there is probably quite a demand. And I think there's probably an undersupply now of labor in the market, which is obviously going to curtail everyone's growth plans. And then also even down to active equipment in the lasers, the OLTs, given the global chip shortages. So I think there are also some other things that will naturally constrain the opportunities for investment. But our overall view is that this market still remains very attractive. And we think that some of the valuations that you've seen on transactions in the space demonstrate that there is a lot of interest in this sector. And ultimately, this is creating the next fourth utility in the market. So we think that this will remain a very attractive space and will only become more attractive as people are able to support businesses that are probably further down that J-curve, call it that, in trying to attract new customers to their networks. Okay, so you both mentioned consolidation, and it's something I've kind of been looking out for as a reporter. But it seems a bit thin on the ground, a few small deals here and there. Do you think it will take maybe a few years before we start seeing, for example, a major regional player being taken over by one that's trying to be a countrywide player? Yeah, sure. Look, thanks. I think that it will probably be a little bit longer before people start rolling assets up, because at this stage, I don't think anyone's really, in terms of the alt net space outside of a couple of the very early movers, have really established enough of a network to probably demonstrate that they've really got the level of customer penetration rates that would make it really attractive for an acquirer. Most of them are still at that fairly early stage. They're still staking their pegs in their relative relevant geographies. But I think once that becomes a little bit clearer and their success becomes clearer, and they've actually been able to deliver a network, and they're probably north of 100,000 premises passed, then I think at that stage, you've become quite interesting as a potential target. And we've even seen some of the, I suppose, the mid-scale ISP type entities looking to try to bring in coalitions of alt nets. And I think that's almost the first step in trying to create national networks of alt nets. Okay. I think when you were talking earlier, you spoke about creating a network with your three investments. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit? Sure. So our view is that we've started to invest in very regionally different areas, but they are quite complementary in that they are typically rural builds, but we've now built a business telecom that's quite urban centric and really fills in some of the gaps in terms of skills and experience. So actually, our view is that we can bring them together, we can use group procurement methods, we can use all of the other benefits of trying to share learnings across the group, and then ultimately over time, look to try to bring them together and try to rationalise some of the cost bases, because that is going to be the most efficient way. It's quite difficult to get economies of scale in the construction side. There are obviously benefits in terms of buying power, and that's an important element, but really where you can get a huge amount of operational leverage comes from when you can leverage sales and marketing budgets and teams to really drive that further forward. So that's where we think that the medium term opportunity is. And we hope that we're there playing when we can start to get into that consolidation phase ourselves. All right, thank you. James, I wondered if you have any thoughts about when consolidation is likely to happen in a big way, and if you can say anything about potential collaboration among your several investments in the sector. We haven't seen any large businesses being consolidated yet. Will that happen next year? Possibly, but I tend to agree with Peter that that will be in the next couple of years, particularly as businesses deliver significant amounts of network and actually get some regional scale. I think at that point it starts to get interesting to consolidate them. And as has been said, where businesses win contracts under Project Gigabit, that will also present some interesting challenges. In terms of our own portfolio, they do already have regular interactions to share learnings, given they're all doing a similar thing in different regions. But the key point that I probably agree with Peter on is that ultimately delivery is a very local thing. And one of the reasons that we've invested in these separate businesses is because it's a very hands-on operational task, building fibre networks, mobilising big teams of construction people, and getting them to roll out in an organised fashion in these particular regions. And that's something that's best handled locally. Okay, thank you, James. You mentioned BT Openreach waking up to the need to invest in fibre, and I think Virgin Media are making plans there as well. So I wondered if you think that's going to change the landscape significantly and make it more difficult for altnets to challenge them? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the reality is, it's going to take a long time to get every premise in the UK connected up with full fibre. And the altnets that have been funded and are building in particular regions will continue to do that. I think Openreach's key focus seems to be on particular towns and cities. And that's where Virgin Media O2's network is, as well. And a lot of the building that's taking place is in those cities, where it's a lot lower cost and a lot quicker to roll out. I think coming back to some of the points made earlier by Bita, there will be, it's hard to see a lot more altnets getting funded in the sense that there's already enough platforms out there to cover the country a number of times over. But we don't think that it's a particular threat to the existing business plans. Okay, thank you. Peter, do you have any thoughts on that? I do. Yeah, look, I think BT Openreach and Virgin have been out there for a long time trying to serve customers, and they've done a somewhat good job. But equally, there's a lot of customers that have access to BT Openreach, and they've chosen to go with altnets because the altnets can give a better overall value proposition. And that's, I think, something that ultimately we will continue to, I think, over-deliver or over-index on compared to the big incumbents. And I think our general perception is that at some point we'll be overbuilt by BT Openreach, even in all of the alternate areas that they aren't currently covering. So I think as long as you keep that in mind, then I think there's still a very relevant place for the altnets. And then also picking up on another area that I think is interesting is that, for example, wireless is another tool that a lot of the altnets can use to help target areas that are very hard to reach or very expensive to target with full fiber. And I think it's this blend of mixed network also that is something that plays well into the altnet's hand. And I do think that over the next few years, you'll see that gigabit wireless will become a feature of how some of these altnets go and really try to connect up the hard to reach rural areas. And for us, that's always been a very key attraction for us, being able to find a way to use these mixed networks, because it really does allow you to essentially get yourself into the customer, get connected with them, and then overbuild yourself with fiber in due course. And on some of the businesses that we back, we're seeing some amazing developments on the wireless front with really full gigabit services that are super reliable and we think represent best value to BDUK as well. So yeah, these are the sorts of things that I think altnets will always probably stay a step or two ahead. But we all have to assume that they're going to be coming for us. We've just got to stay better in terms of what the customers care about. And that's ultimately great service and great connections. Okay, sorry, I just want to ask one follow up one. So you said that you assume that you will be overbuilt by Openreach eventually. I just wondered when that might happen and how you will handle it when it does. I would have thought, as James mentioned earlier, and you'll have seen from announcements and BC Openreach, they're certainly out going trying to procure capital to enable them to do a much larger rollout than even what they'd originally planned. So I would have thought that it's probably by 2030 that they would have overbuilt. They've shown that it does take a long time to build networks. It's not as quick as you might hope. It does require people and that at the moment is, I think, the limiting factor. So I think, yeah, it's over the next five to 10 years, I would imagine. But maybe they can find a way to do it faster if they can find a new technique. But I think most of the new trenching techniques and the like have been probably procured or they've been worked on and discovered. So I don't see any real technological leaps in terms of how quickly we can roll out fibre now. It's just a case of getting manpower out there and doing the hard yards. Very interesting times ahead, I think. I would just like to say thanks very much to both James and Peter. Thanks Rory. Thanks Rory, bye.

Welcome to Crossroads, the podcast, and this time, the Asia-Pacific edition. My name is Robin Ganguly. I am the Asia-Pacific editor for InfoLogic, as well as Information and SparkSpread. Today, we have two very distinguished guests. We have Hardik Shah, Managing Director of Infrastructure from KKR, and we also have Cecilio Velasco, who is Director of Infrastructure at KKR as well. Hardik, if you could just introduce yourself for our listeners. Thank you, Robin. Thank you for inviting us to this podcast. Like you said, I'm Hardik Shah. I'm part of KKR's Asia-Pacific infrastructure team. I'm in Mumbai, and I'm primarily responsible for KKR's infrastructure investments in India. Thanks for that, Hardik. Cecilio? Hi, everyone, and thanks for having me, Robin. I'm Cecilio Velasco, and I'm a Director here at KKR's Asia-Pacific infrastructure strategy based in our Singapore office. Thanks to both of you, Hardik and Cecilio, for joining us today. I really appreciate the time, and I know, Cecilio, you've been quite busy since early this morning at the Infrastructure Investors Forum today this morning. To begin the discussion, Hardik, perhaps this might be directed at you. KKR seems to have rather big renewables ambitions. What, for you, are the most attractive markets in Asia-Pacific and around the world for renewables, and if you could just tell us why, and just drilling down into which sectors as well, solar, wind, or offshore wind? Sure, Robin. So, the renewable sector has been a sector of focus for KKR across our infrastructure strategies for a number of years. So, we've made a number of investments in the sector across the world, whether it's in North America, whether Europe, and more recently in the Asia-Pacific region as well. So, it's a theme that we've looked at investing into for many, many years now, and that theme has now grown multifold and is now what we call the energy transition theme. And so, just plain vanilla renewable energy investment is now morphing and evolving into what we're calling the energy transition, and certainly the Asia-Pacific region is a region where we see a lot more opportunity to prosecute this energy transition theme. We've already made investments behind this theme in markets like India and Southeast Asia from our various strategies, and we will continue to look at investing behind this theme across different countries in the region. In terms of which are the most attractive markets, I think a large part of the Asia-Pac region offers a lot of opportunity here. So, markets like India, China have very, very large targets for renewable energy and clean energy, and so we will look to invest behind that theme across those markets. You've got markets like Korea, Australia, Japan, which while are smaller in terms of megawatts, but are quite large in terms of their ambition and in terms of the amount of capital needed to invest behind those themes. So, we do see that we will continue to make further inroads into the energy transition across this region, across pretty much all our focused markets. In terms of which sectors are more attractive, I do think that's quite country-specific and region-specific, though we do already have investments in solar in the Asia-Pac region, we have investments in wind across our global infrastructure strategy in North America, and it's both solar and wind are sectors we continue to look at across the Asia-Pac region as well. Offshore wind is something we're certainly interested in, but it is slightly more early stage for us right now. It's a sector that we're learning more about and we're looking to do more in. And then you look at other sectors, other more emerging sectors across the energy transition theme like storage, like hydrogen, etc. Again, those are sectors that we've got on our minds and those are sectors we continue to research and look at, and those are sectors we hope to invest in in the near to medium term. Thanks for that. Yes, I agree. Harvik, just a quick follow-up. You know, KKR has been pretty active in India and I understand you're based in Mumbai. What about if you're looking at India specifically, because several investors that I've spoken to in recent times have stated what is actually the obvious is that, you know, you cannot invest in the Asia-Pacific without, you know, having a bit of the India pie. So, what do you see as the most attractive sectors in India specifically? And, you know, you guys have gone in, you know, with the whole infra system in about three years ago. And what would you say are some of the challenges of investing in a very complicated market like India? Sure. So, completely agree with the sentiment there, Robin. India continues to be one of our key focus markets among others in the Asia-Pac region. And the reason for that is that India is probably one of the deeper and more active markets for foreign and private infrastructure investing in the region. The Indian government has been focused on private sector participation in infrastructure for the better part of 20 years now. Different sectors have been inviting private sector participation for different periods of time. So, sectors like roads, etc., have seen PPP in roads for over 20 years now. And that's a very, very mature sector. Sectors like airports, ports, transmission, etc., probably started seeing private sector participation between 10 and 15 years ago. And again, those sectors are maturing as well. And what that's resulted in is you've got a very large pool of operating infrastructure assets with long-term government contracts that you've got available in the country for foreign investors to invest in. And that's contributing to creating an ecosystem here of investors, of developers who want to build these assets and then sell to longer-term owners. So, what we have here is probably one of the more active market, more active infrastructure markets across this region, for sure. And you do have attractive assets here that people want to own for the longer term. I think that is what contributes to the sentiment that you're seeing across a lot of foreign investors that you must be in India. And then to the second part of your question, which is what are the sort of risks or what is the, how do you sort of, what keeps us up at night, let me put it that way. I think you actually touched upon it in your question itself, which was, it is a complex market. It's a complex market with a lot of interlinkages, with a lot of, I would say, not unseen risks, but certainly risks that can creep up on you. So, as such, the way we get comfortable with it is we've been, KKR as a firm has been present in India on the ground for the better part of 15 years. We've spent time learning about the market, not just infrastructure, but just more broadly. And we've spent time creating the relationships, creating the linkages, which we think helps us identify the right assets to create the right risk-adjusted returns. Harik, I don't know if I'm putting you on the spot here, but just a couple of examples of the challenges of doing business in India, especially, you know, given the realities of COVID-19. Sure. I think the COVID-19 piece is just, it's hard to, it's hard for someone to visit. And that's the reality. It's hard for doing diligence. It's hard to sort of get to meet people, et cetera. And that situation is normalizing, but I would say for the better part of the last 18 months, a lot of transactions have had to be done virtually, which is okay to do with people you've known for many years, but it's very hard to do with someone you've never met. So I think that's certainly been one challenge over the last 18 months, but more broadly, I think the risks that one sees is just the uncertainty in the way situations will play out, the timelines it takes sometimes for getting government approvals, the timelines it takes to get things done. I think that's the key. Those are the key uncertainties that one has to be prepared to face when you're looking to invest in India. And again, if you've been around for a long period of time, if you've got the right relationships, you'll know that upfront. So you will build, you'll think that through upfront before sort of running behind a transaction or an opportunity. Thanks for Harvik. You know, I'm actually going to come back to you on that point a bit later, but I just want to quickly move across to Cecilia. Cecilia, thanks for waiting so patiently. You know, I have a question. So KKR has built a significant presence in Asia since 2005 or so. You know, you have localized teams in different parts of the region. Could you tell me more about the infrastructure team and your approach to investing in the region? I mean, Cecilia, you could start and then, you know, Harvik, if you wanted to jump in, please go ahead, Cecilia. Yeah, absolutely. Happy to elaborate a little. So in general, as you noted, KKR started building out as a practice, you know, well over a decade ago. And with that really started with the private equity side of the house and really took a localized approach where it set a number of offices in the major or the key countries that we were focused on over time and really hired a lot of people locally and has a lot of people locally. And as private equity sort of, you know, was established from there, KKR started layering in a couple more strategies in the region. So our Asian infrastructure strategy where Harvik and I both work is an example. And so what we basically did is, you know, we added infrastructure specialists and we tend to have a couple in each of our major markets focused on those markets and really working with and leveraging the broader KKR platform. And candidly, that has been, you know, a huge asset to us in just already having a presence in the market, already being known, having KKR representatives, even if they're focused on other strategies who have relationships and understand the local dynamics and have good connectivity has been a pretty neat stepping stone as we think about, you know, the Asia infrastructure strategy in and of itself. And then I'd also say that, you know, together with that sort of localized approach, we do, you know, really function as one Asia infrastructure team with, you know, pretty seamless collaboration and really working together and sort of cross-staffing and, you know, using best practices and industry expertise across the team as if we were one, even though, you know, physically we're pretty localized in terms of where folks in our strategy sit. So it's kind of a high level. Harvik, I don't know if you want to add something to that. Cecilia, is KKR looking to expand the team in Asia Pacific? Yeah. So look, as a general matter, you know, we are growing our strategy. And so when we think about the team, we gradually sort of increase it as we go. So not that we're particularly sort of looking at anything specific right now, but, you know, we prudently continue to grow the team alongside the growth of the strategy. Okay. Just one more thing is, you know, if you could just help me understand what exactly are your responsibilities at Harvik as well? Yeah, absolutely. So for my side, I sit here in the Singapore office. So I spend a fair bit of my time really looking after the Southeast Asia market, but also help support sort of our digital infrastructure strategy across the region and then sort of work with David, the head of our strategy across a number of APAC sort of level efforts within our team. Excellent. Which actually leads me to my next question. So while several PE funds have invested in the data center sector in Southeast Asia in recent months, KKR has not publicly at least announced any participation yet. Any reason for that? Yeah, well, look, for us, really, data centers is a key area of focus for our strategy. You know, when we say digital infrastructure or telecom infrastructure, we really have three pillars. First, data centers, second, telecom towers, and third, fiber networks, really as the main ones. And within data centers, you know, it's really a business model and a market that we like. You know, it's fast growing, and it has a lot of infrastructure-like characteristics around sort of contracts, visibility of cash flow, you know, capital intensive and the like. That said, you know, it is also a business with many moving pieces. So data centers have a real estate component, local permitting, power procurement, construction, sales force. So it really does require an experienced team that's fairly robust to handle the execution. And so for us, you know, at this stage, we sort of haven't found the right fit for our strategy. But data centers, you know, in Southeast Asia, and APAC, globally more broadly, are certainly within scope. As an example, currently, our broader infrastructure team does have one data center platform in Europe called Global Technical Realty, which is a team that we backed, you know, last year. Thanks for that. And Cecilia, you know, you might be in a unique position to answer my follow-up question about Singapore and, you know, the curbs on building data centers. So where are investors going then? The ones who, you know, would assume would have liked to invest in Singapore data centers, where are they headed, do you think? Yeah, so in terms of the growth on the data center side, I would say, you know, you have an established data center market and really sort of data centers across Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, China, Japan. So sort of some of the bigger geographies or some of the more developed markets. And some of the more emerging Asia, like Indonesia, Philippines, data centers are still a little bit newer, you know. So I think people see them a lot as the next frontier of where data centers are going to get started. And, you know, when you look at places like Indonesia, I would almost say, like, it's already there. There's a lot of teams, a lot of companies, a lot of focus, you know, the sort of build-out is on its way. So the operational footprint is still limited, but the build-out, you know, is definitely ongoing. When you look at a few places like Philippines, you know, there it's a little bit earlier stage than Indonesia. So there you see, you know, a lot of focus and excitement and talk, but the execution is sort of still coming together. And that's obviously, you know, with the exception of the established players in the market, like the Telcos, they do have some footprint and some existing data centers, but not really kind of at the scale and the size that we see some of the, you know, independent data center companies or the hyperscalers really building, you know, massive data centers. Hardik, just coming back to you. First of all, both of you, immense congratulations for earlier this year, you know, USD 3.9 billion close of your first infrastructure fund, you know, looking forward to hearing more about your second fund when you do launch it. Hardik, this one is more for you. How excited is KKR or you, for instance, by the opportunity to remake power grids as we move to a new renewables dominated power market? Is that something you're familiar with and happy to comment on? Absolutely. So the first investment that KKR made as part of its Asia Pacific infrastructure strategy was to acquire control and a significant shareholding in India Grid Trust, which is an infrastructure trust here in India that owns high voltage, long distance electricity transmission assets. And we've supported the growth of that trust from about a 750 million dollar asset base when we came in two and a half, three years ago to today over 2.6 or 2.7 billion dollars of assets that that trust owns. And we've provided us along with partners have provided the capital to support that growth. And we continue to look forward to investing into that team and continue to sort of to grow our exposure to that team. And Robin, a large part of that growth is actually coming from the Indian government's ambitions on renewable energy. So one follow on impact of increasing renewable energy capacity is that you need more transmission capacity because renewable energy, as you know, is intermittent in nature. So the investment that goes alongside in transmission capacity is a lot more than what you have to do if you're building the same capacity of thermal coal or gas fired plants. So what we're trying to tap into through our investment in India Grid Trust is exactly that theme, that as the grid in India becomes or as energy capacity in India becomes more green, the follow on impact will be that there will be more transmission capacity needed and we want to be the capital provider of choice for transmission lines in India. Okay. Is there a sweet spot that you have as far as returns are concerned? Higher the better, no? But only joking, only joking. We look at things more, we look at things more from a risk adjusted return basis. And ultimately, we want to make sure we are the preferred source of capital for opportunities and we want to come in and price things on at where we're making the right returns for the level of risk that we're undertaking. So our cost of capital for something that is way down the risk curve would be very different from our cost of capital for something that is much more early stage, much more greenfield in nature, I would say. So I don't think we look at things on an absolute basis. We do sort of evaluate each opportunity basis, the risk that is inherent in that opportunity, in that cash flow, in that business plan, and then try to think through what's the right rate of return that we need to provide or provide our investors for taking that risk. Thanks. Is there a sweet spot for the size of equity investments that you make? So we're quite flexible. We're actually quite flexible. We've been able to do transactions that are quite outsized for the size of the fund that we have. And we've been able to do that by using the power of the KKR network, the KKR balance sheet, KKR's partners, etc. So we're actually quite flexible in terms of what sort of transactions that we want to do. I mean, the way we see it is if we think the transaction is a right fit, is the right fit for us, it's an attractive transaction on sort of the risk reward spectrum, we want to try, we will try and make it work whether within KKR or with partners, etc. And that's how we try and approach our new transactions. Thanks for that. Adi, just, you know, I wanted to go back to what we were speaking about earlier about, you know, the difficulty or the complexity of doing business in India. You know, we cover infrastructure, as you're aware, and power and energy and renewables. So one of the most noticeable features that, you know, I have seen as far as policy is concerned is Nitin Gadkari. He seems to be quite, you know, going hell for leather to try and speed up projects, just try and speed up approvals. We've seen situations where he sent directives to, you know, to officials to try and speed up things and not to hold on to approval, lengthy approval processes. Is that the right sort of impression? Do you think things are improving as far as regulatory issues and approvals and so on and so forth? So Robin, I would say so. I think we've seen more streamlined processes. And we've seen processes get quicker. We've seen the government across sectors and across ministries be a lot more progressive and a lot more welcoming towards foreign capital into infrastructure assets in India. So if you look at the infrastructure investment trust regulations that came up about five, six years ago, but have continually been refined and evolved into what they are today, and which they're very, they're very investor friendly and very, very amenable regulations that have allowed a lot of capital to pour into infrastructure investment trusts. If you look at the government's national monetization plan, where the government wants to recycle capital from operating assets that the government, government companies and government departments own, in order to create capacity to build more greenfield infrastructure. And I think a large part of the NMP is focused towards foreign investors. And to the government's credit, they've taken on a lot of feedback from the private sector in terms of how to design that NMP. How do you actually execute on those specific transactions and achieve those specific goals that they've set out? So yes, I would say directionally, certainly things are getting more streamlined, and things are getting faster. The other big Asian giant, the world's second largest economy. I had spoken to your colleagues more than a year earlier, and you know, the impression that I got at that point of time for China was, you know, wait and watch. Has that changed? Is KKR planning on becoming more active in China? Or are you watching for the moment? We've always been active in China. That's the reality. We've always continued to look at transactions in China. Our private equity funds, for example, have made a lot of investments into into a lot of companies in China, and have been very, very successful. From the infrastructure lens, and from day one, we've been a lot more focused on B2C or B2B type assets, where the customers that you've got are more corporate in nature, or more sort of consumer in nature, as opposed to sort of contracted assets. And that's been the strategy, and we continue to look at, look to deploy capital into the infrastructure sector of China across those kinds of assets. Thanks for that, Hardik. I think that's really useful information. Cecilia, I'm going to move to you. You know, we're running out of time. We'll try and pack in a couple of questions. Southeast Asia, bright spots? Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, Southeast Asia is a region we're pretty excited about in general. Reality is, we are seeing a lot of growth across the board and in many markets. For us, the two priority ones would be Philippines and Indonesia, really. But you know, that doesn't mean we're not active across the broader Southeast Asia as well. From an industry standpoint, you know, everything from visual infrastructure, as I had mentioned, to renewables, to transportation, to energy, are really sort of big areas that we've been focusing on. Okay. And what about Australia and New Zealand? Yeah. So, Australia and New Zealand is also an area of focus for us. We have a couple of colleagues from the infrastructure side there, based in Sydney, who spend most of their time looking at Australia and New Zealand. There, we've recently done two transactions earlier this year, one in the power transmission space and one in the transportation space. So, also a market, you know, obviously, deep with infrastructure, a little bit more competitive than some others in the region, but definitely full of opportunities if you're looking in the right places. Thank you for that. Hardik, your opinion, apart from Southeast Asia and Australia and New Zealand, rest of Asia-Pac and globally, what do you think are the bright spots for global investors? I think what we're seeing, Robin, is we're seeing a lot more capital that is infrastructure focused move into the broader Asia-Pac region. I think you've seen North America and Europe attract a lot of capital over the last 10 years and continuously on an increasing basis as the macro fundamentals of those regions have led more institutional investors to divert their capital towards infrastructure. We are now starting to see the follow-on impact of that and starting to see a lot of that capital, starting to look at Asia with a lot more keenness, I would say. So, the conversations we've been having with our partners, with our investors, with people in the market, I think have shown that increasing interest over the last three years and the way things are going, we expect that interest to continue. Within the Asia-Pac region, we think all the markets that we're looking at will continue to see more interest. We sort of divide the Asia-Pac region into emerging Asia and developed Asia. If you look at developed Asia, it's Australia, New Zealand, which have a very deep local market as well and a lot of assets and a lot of transaction activity. Then you have markets like Korea, which again have a lot of local capital, but also have a lot of foreign investor interest now. And then you have markets like Japan, which have a lot of assets, but it's probably, I would say, a few years – Japan as an infrastructure asset market is a few years behind the rest of the region, but we do see a lot more activity there coming up, especially in the renewable energy space. So that's something that we think is attracting a lot of capital. And then when you look at emerging Asia, which is markets like India, Southeast Asia, etc. Again, India is probably a more active market than what we've seen other markets in emerging Asia, but certainly as we see activity grow in markets like the Philippines, where we've been very active, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc., we're starting to see a lot more interest from investors there as well. So overall, we do see a trend of increased activity and increased investor interest in pretty much the entire region. And I think what that does is it kickstarts the ecosystem, right? Once there's capital available, transaction ideas come up and transactions become available, and then that sort of leads to more capital being available, and that's the virtuous cycle. And we're seeing that cycle start in Asia, and we're probably already a couple of years into that cycle now within Asia. Okay. You know, we keep hearing about a post-COVID-19 world. So, what are the markers we need to see to say we're in that stage as far as KKR is concerned? So, what markers do you want to see to say that you are in a post-COVID-19 world? I would say, Robin, for the large part, especially I speak with a bit of evidence, at least in the Indian market, I would say for the large part, we are, unless there's a horrendous wave three or there's a huge wave three that comes up, we are already entering the post-COVID world. Now, when you look at whether you look at assets like renewable energy, whether it's transmission, roads, which we're investors in right now, most of those, most if not all of those assets have come back or are surpassing pre-COVID numbers. I think the resiliency that we've seen in the economy and the way we've seen things bounce back has been very, very heartening to see. So, overall, for the large part, except for pockets of areas like airports, for example, which are impacted more by government lockdowns or government shutdowns or government restrictions on international travel, I think everything else which doesn't have a sort of regulatory impediment to it, I think most of it, if not all, has already bounced back to pre-COVID levels. You realize, Hadek, that this makes for a very snappy headline. KKR's Hadek says already in post-COVID-19 situation. That would be really interesting. And I, you know, Hadek, I agree with you entirely. I mean, even looking at infrologic data early last year, the predictions of Armageddon and nothing seems to have dropped off. Everything seems to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels. Amazing kegs of powder. And, you know, if you look at charts, if you look at the data charts as far as, you know, closed transactions and even live transactions, things are looking up. So, there was no real drop off, was there? I mean, for a brief period, yes, but it's pretty much come back. Isn't that true? I think so. And I think what it points to is we found, like the world has found and the market has found ways to adapt, right? For things that you used to have to go meet people earlier, now you're happy to do Zoom calls and continue moving on. There was, I would say, a brief period where things just froze for a couple of months, both last year and this year. But I think the resiliency of the underlying assets, the sector, the people working in the sector or people working in general, I think that's come out in spades. And that has all contributed to how quickly things have bounced back, whether, like you said, in transaction activity, whether on actual physical economic activity on the ground as well. I think all of that is pointing towards things are going to come back to normal if they haven't already much sooner than people thought 18 months ago. Okay, Cecilia, the same question with a focus on Southeast Asia. I ask you, Southeast Asia, because you are based in Singapore and there seems to be from our readers, especially a lot of interest in Southeast Asia. So already flirting with post-COVID-19 or are we still yet to come out from there? Yeah. So, I agree with everything Hardik said from a business environment standpoint. However, sitting here in Singapore today, it's a little bit hard for me personally to say that it feels like we're in a post-COVID world when I'm still working from home. But I agree with everything Hardik said. And I just point out, too, that, you know, it's going to be hard to sort of draw the distinction of where's the firm line when we're in a post-COVID environment. I mean, in my opinion, COVID is going to be a little bit more endemic. And so, it's going to be a little bit of a smoothing into just what is the new normal of living with COVID. And, you know, I think with that lens, I'd say sort of it feels like from a business environment standpoint and sort of activity, you know, we're already there, like things are back, things have bounced back. And of course, there are certain aspects of life or certain businesses or certain restrictions or travel that are different now and will continue to be different for a while. But I guess it's tough to say that one should wait or bank on all of them going back anytime soon and us going back to exactly to a pre-COVID world. I actually couldn't agree more. And, you know, I agree with both of you. My impression is that we are definitely in a post-COVID-19 world, you know, barring the travel restrictions that you mentioned, Cecilio, and, you know, families, you know, kept apart. That's been the tragedy of COVID-19. But hopefully, you know, with vaccination programs, things are going to get better. Hardik and Cecilio, really, really, really grateful for you talking to InfraLogic. And, you know, we hope to continue to keep talking to each other. And Cecilio, you know, if there's a Hong Kong-Singapore bubble and, you know, you do travel to Hong Kong, please allow me to buy you a coffee. And Hardik, the very exact same. We also have an office in Mumbai. And when I'm there, I'd be more than happy to meet up and we could chat over dinner or a coffee. But Hardik and Cecilio, thank you very, very, very much once again. And we hope to have you again in the future soon. Thank you for having us. Thank you, Robin. That was a really good conversation. Thank you for having us.

I'm your host, Andrew Vitelli, a senior reporter with Sparkspread News. Thank you for tuning into the podcast. My guest today is David Burden, a tax partner on Norton Rose Fulbright's project finance team and really one of the preeminent attorneys in the renewable energy space, especially when it comes to anything involving tax equity. I mean, you know, we've been talking about this for a long time. Involving tax equity. I mean, when there's something in the news that involves a tax equity issue or policy, David is generally the first person that I call to make sense of it. So, David, thank you for coming on the podcast today. Thank you. And thank you for that kind introduction. So I'm really glad to have you today because there is so much going on in Washington right now, as I'm sure anyone on the news is aware. And a lot of it could have an impact on the energy and on the renewables sector. So, David, why don't you give me a rundown of everything that's going on that might affect the renewables industry? Sure. I don't know if I'll manage everything, but I'll hit the highlights. Let's do the most important things then. Yep. There are four major issues in Washington at the moment, and veteran lobbyists are saying they've never seen so many moving parts in the tax fiscal agenda before. So the first issue is that the government's fiscal year ends on September 30th and there's been no money appropriated for it to continue operating. So the government needs funded, and that's coming fast because we're almost at the end of September. The second issue is the debt ceiling. We're about to hit the debt ceiling, and that needs to be extended by Congress, increased by Congress. Treasury is saying early to mid-October they can kind of find a change on the sofa and keep the government going, but they're going to run out of what they call extraordinary years sometime around early to mid-October. So that's a train coming right at us that we need to address, and it would be catastrophic for the government to truly default on its debt and basically I cannot see that happening. Then we have the bipartisan infrastructure bill with a price tag of $1.2 trillion. We have some very good provisions for energy transmission, which is critical, and some other energy-related strengthening of the grid provisions, but no energy tax credits in it. It's not a tax credit bill. And then we have what's called the reconciliation bill, which has $3.5 trillion of spending, most of which would be offset through tax increases and much of the 2017 tax reform. And that has sweeping social programs, but also a great expansion of energy tax credits in terms of both the effective dates and the types of tax credits available and the types of technology that qualifies for the tax credits. Senator Manchin has said he would support only $1.5 trillion, but he's obviously a moderate senator from West Virginia. The progressives in the House don't want to give up any of the social programs, the low-income housing, the paid family leave, that type of stuff. They want the whole $3.5 trillion. So even within the Democratic Party, there is not enough votes at the moment to get that budget reconciliation bill passed. So all those four things are floating around. A lot of moving pieces makes it incredibly complicated and difficult to predict as to where it's all going to ultimately fall out. Well, thank you for that rundown, David. And it seems like the one that really is in the industry, especially when it comes to the tax credits, is the reconciliation bill. Can you run down what is in there that's going to impact the renewable energy sector in terms of changes to tax credit law? Yes. Even that is a moving target and relatively fluid. Most recently, we have the bill passed by the House Ways and Means earlier this month that is called the Build Back Better Act, the Build Back Better Act, which basically follows an outline created by President Biden and the executive branch team. But President Biden's proposal was just an outline, didn't have statutory language. The Build Back Better Act gives us statutory language and it's been passed by Ways and Means, hasn't gotten, has not passed the full House and obviously has not passed the Senate. So it has a ways to go. We also have the Green Act, which was supported by more progressive Democrats and has been introduced a couple of times. Then we have Senator Wyden's bill, which has passed his committee in the Senate, his Senate Finance Committee. So it's a very fluid legislative item. And then we don't know what Senator Manchin, who's kind of the linchpin in the Senate, will support. He has said again that he only is comfortable with $1.5 trillion of spending, not $3.5 trillion. And he has also expressed concerns about some of the climate change provisions. Those concerns have just been generic statements rather than specifically saying he didn't like one thing or another. So to get him on board, there's going to need to be some compromise and some trimming of provisions to bring it into line with what he wants and he holds the linchpin boat in the Senate. In terms of what the Better Act would do, it does a couple of things. It pushes out the effective dates or re-expiration dates for the solar ITC and for the wind PTC and for the Section 45Q carbon capture credits. It also lets projects that qualify for either ITC or PTC pick the other one. So for instance, right now a solar project could not opt for the production tax credit, the PTC, but under this bill a solar project could claim the 30% ITC or be $25 a megawatt hour PTC as wind can do currently and wind still can. It also provides tax credits for battery storage on a standalone basis, not having to be powered or charged by renewable energy source. So you could have a battery that is charged by the grid or a standalone battery charged by a coal plant. Senator Manchin might be interested in that, that would qualify for a tax credit while currently the battery qualifies for an ITC but only if it's charged by an ITC eligible project. So that's all expanded. Those goodies come with conditions though. For a full tax credit you have to meet generally three conditions. One is you have to have pay prevailing wages, so Davis-Bacon prevailing wages that's not just during construction that's also for O&M, operations and maintenance. Second of which is you have to have an apprentice program, you have to have a certain number of apprentices on site. There's an exception for the apprentice program if there's no apprentices available in the area the project's in. Then the third thing is you have to have 55% domestic content and that can be quite a challenge. If you don't meet all those requirements, you get a reduced tax credit depending on various deadlines and variations, you get a reduced tax credit and if you fail to pay the prevailing wage and have the apprentice program you can suffer recapture or have to pay penalties and for the prevailing wage you'd have to pay the workers the difference that they were underpaid plus interest and pay a penalty to the IRS. So there's a lot of conditions on getting the full tax credit and if you're just kind of a regular project that doesn't have 55% domestic content using apprentices and paying prevailing wages you're going to get a much smaller tax credit. So kind of a status quo result would be a smaller tax credit than is available currently. It looks like if the project had started construction for the bills passed you may escape these additional social policy type requirements in terms of the wages, apprentices and the domestic content but that's not not entirely clear either. Again, there's a lot of moving pieces. So to be clear, these requirements the Davis-Bacon and some of the other ones in terms of apprentices these don't only apply to some of the additional benefits that are part of this bill. They would apply even if you were trying to get the existing tax credits. So for some projects it sounds like this bill could be a net negative? It could be a net negative. Again, they may, depending on when the project was deemed to have started construction it may avoid this but yes it could be overall less than what the project would have qualified for in absence of these additional requirements. There's exclusions for small projects obviously if you're putting solar on your house you don't have to pay prevailing wages or have apprentices so there's even smaller C&I projects so there's some exceptions. It's basically targeted at larger utility scale type projects but yes the full tax credit comes at a cost under the bill. The other thing the bill has is what's called direct pay which is basically the 1603 cash grant program 2.0 but rather than being administered by the treasury and have to follow an application process it would be a cash tax refund so you would be deemed to have overpaid your taxes and you would be entitled to a tax refund. The direct pay if you want to opt for the cash from the IRS that you do have to comply with the wage apprentice and domestic content rules and it is going to be I think a less popular program than people may be anticipating in terms of direct pay. First of all if you're claiming an ITC an investment tax credit if you want to claim it based on the fair market value rather than based on just the cost to build the project you'll need to have either a sale of the project between different taxpayers or you'll need to have a lease of the project between different taxpayers so that that's going to require involvement of other parties. Next thing is it does not monetize the accelerated depreciation either so-called bonus depreciation or macros depreciation and that's a tax benefit than the tax credits but it's still important and sponsors still want to capture value for the accelerated depreciation the project qualifies for. The other thing is you have to make the election very early on so we're saying you have to make the election when you start construction so you're not allowed to sort of play it out and say well ideally I'd like to raise tax equity because that monetizes the depreciation as well but if I can't then I'm going to go for the direct pay, the cash payment but rather you have to make that election very early on so you don't have that optionality. There's talk about a haircut for going for direct pay. Some policy makers say well you're you know a tax equity investor doesn't transact for free so you're avoiding that cost, you're avoiding legal fees, accounting fees, you know, let's haircut it so that remains to be seen if direct pay is enacted with a haircut. Various proposals have different views on whether or not there should be a haircut and then you'll have to go through the tax refund process and if the refund is paid to a corporation, a C-Corp and it's five million dollars or more or if it's paid to an individual and it's two million dollars or more it appears you're going to have to go through a special refund program or refund process whereby first the IRS has to review the refund in detail, then the IRS has to send a report about the refund to the Joint Committee on Taxation and then the Joint Committee on Taxation has 30 days to act. If it does nothing, it's deemed to have approved it. The Joint Committee on Taxation is a congressional committee that then has a large tax staff of lawyers and accountants and economists so that tax staff would be reviewing your refund request after the IRS has reviewed it. If the tax staff has concerns about it, it then goes back to the IRS to adjust the refund amount or look into it further and make whatever necessary changes the tax staff feel should be considered and then the process starts all over again so it can take quite some time. It could be quite a while between when you commission your project and then actually get the tax credits for it given all these procedures you have to jump through. It is possible and the legislation is very much in flux and it's impossible that Congress could decide to exclude these refunds under direct pay from these special reviews by the IRS and the Joint Committee but it tends to be when you ask a member of Congress to carve out your tax credit from these reviews but a member of Congress is hesitant to do so. What do you mean? You don't want anybody looking at it? It shouldn't be studied by experts. You just want a free pass to do whatever you want so it's hard to sell that as a policy matter to members of Congress so it could happen that these reviews are not required but right now it appears they will be and that's probably if we end up with direct pay that's probably where I would guess they end up being required. So I know that direct pay has been a priority for the industry. It's something that industry groups have been calling for for some time. It sounds like you think it might bring less benefits and more complications than a lot of folks in the industry are expecting. Yeah I think that's right. I mean I think people ignore the fact that they get the ITC based on a fair market value. You need a transaction between two tax payers so they ignore that fact. They overlook the fact that well the depreciation is important as well and direct pay doesn't monetize that. They overlook the time value of money issue and how long the process is to get a refund even if you don't go through a special review and then they don't consider the fact this special review is basically asking to be audited by some very sharp tax professionals and they may find issues of what you've done. If you recall back to the 1603 cash grant days in the Obama administration at the end of a 1603 program it was pretty much unusable because between delays and getting things paid and so-called haircuts that the treasury personnel running the program imposed on applications sponsors pretty much said this isn't worth it. I'm just going to raise tax equity. I have more certainty as to the amount and the timing and you know this is a similar situation. This could be go through the tax return process at the IRS rather than Treasury but it's still bureaucratic time consuming and subject to disagreement over the right amount of payment. So another priority and this is something you mentioned has been an ITC like benefit for a standalone storage. Right now a standalone storage or storage in general must be charged by a renewable resource a certain percent of the time in order to be eligible for the ITC. How big an impact do you think expanding this benefit to standalone storage would have on the battery industry? This is something you think would really kick it into gear because we've seen growth even without this benefit. So just to be clear under current law it's not that just you have to be charged by a renewable energy resource. You have to be charged by an ITC resource, right? So under current law you attach a battery to a wind project and onshore wind project claiming PTCs. That battery doesn't qualify, right? So it's really quite precise and you have to have the same tax owner of the battery and of the project that's charging it. So if you did a deal with Taxically Investor X to build a solar project and then Taxically Investor X says, well, I don't want to invest in your battery. I don't have tax appetite. I don't like batteries. You and I have not gotten along, whatever the issue may be. You're stuck. You can't bring in Taxically Investor Y for the battery. You have to have the same taxpayer on the battery and on the project that charges it. So it's pretty restrictive currently. I think to lift those rules and make standalone storage tax credit eligible would be tremendous. As you've said, we have seen storage grow. There have been some standalone storage projects financed and they do have offtake contracts. But I think if there's a tax credit for standalone storage, it's really going to take off and we need it because the renewables are the key to addressing climate change, but they come with intermittency. Wind doesn't generate power. The wind's not blowing and solar doesn't generate power. The sun's not shining and batteries can be the bridge to cover the intermittency. So they really are critical to addressing climate change and there has been growth, but we need more growth in batteries and I think a standalone tax credit for batteries will really accelerate that growth and make it even more common than it is now. But even without this specific credit, the industry has been growing and there is even a supply shortage. So in the near term at least, wouldn't this benefit go more towards just getting higher prices for battery suppliers rather than spurring new projects? That's always the question about these tax credits, right? Are we just gilding the pockets of people who would otherwise undertake this activity? So I'm not an economist. It's a valid question. I don't have an answer, but I guess what I would say we have seen and we saw this in solar, right? You could have said the same thing when solar tax credits have been extended and expanded. You could say, well, this was going to happen anyway. These people wanted to build solar anyway, but we've seen more manufacturers get involved. We've seen more technology. We've seen huge technological improvements. So when you motivate people to manufacture a product because it has strong returns, because those returns are supported by tax credits, you see competition in that manufacturing, you see technological developments, and then you see a more and a better product being produced. And certainly that's been the case of solar. If you look how the cost of solar has come down and how the efficiency has gone up over the past decade, it's really pretty remarkable. And again, I'm not an economist, but I'm optimistic that we would see similar drop in cost in batteries and similar improvements in technology in batteries if we have a standalone solid, reliable tax credit for storage. So I want to go back to one of the concerns that you mentioned before, and that's the domestic content requirement. I think you said 55% would have to be produced domestically for these projects to be eligible for the tax credits. And obviously that's something that is aimed at spurring American manufacturing, which has been a priority of both parties. But how realistic is that? How would the industry be able to react to such a mandate? I'm not an engineer or manufacturing specialist, but from what I'm hearing anecdotally is that projects are not able to meet it and that it's not realistic currently. It's just not feasible given how much of the input for solar projects comes from various Asian countries in terms of raw materials, manufactured materials, etc. And in terms of meeting the different components of a solar project, not just the modules, but also the inverter, the transformer. So what I'm hearing anecdotally is that it's not feasible. And I have major concerns about the domestic content requirement and whether projects will be able to meet it without going to extremes, which will make it uneconomic. Obviously, this is a very large bill. I think the proposal is $3.5 trillion, even if Manchin is saying $1.5 trillion. Obviously, that's a lot of money that is going to have to come from somewhere. Are there any concerns in terms of how this spending is going to be paid for that has raised red flags for the renewable sector in particular? The biggest way the spending is going to be paid for is a corporate tax rate increase from the current 21 percent to 26.5 percent. So still much below the 35 percent that we had before 2017 tax reform, but still a big jump from 21 to 26.5. Also, individual tax rate increase back to the 39.6 percent we had before tax reform, and then also increase on capital gains tax and a surcharge on millionaires. I think 3 percent for over $5 million of income a year. So, certainly economists are concerned about, some economists, not all, but some economists are concerned about whether that's going to stifle growth and make America less competitive and cause jobs and businesses to move overseas. Generally, higher taxes is good for the renewable energy industry because it means that corporations who are typically the ones monetizing tax benefits and depreciation for these projects have more tax appetite so their management can decide that they want to do more deals. Generally, it's an odd industry we're in in that it benefits often from higher taxes because it means there's more tax appetite and more ability for corporations to use the tax credits these deals create, and also higher interest rates. The connection to higher interest rates is that the depreciation benefit is what accountants call a timing benefit. It's just a matter of recovering your costs quicker than you otherwise would, and that's essentially like an interest-free loan from the IRS, and that interest-free loan is obviously more valuable if interest rates are 5% or 6% than if interest rates are 1% or 2%. So, renewable energy is an interesting industry that actually benefits from higher tax credits and higher interest rates, although people are certainly sanguine to the implications for the broader economy and for American competitiveness abroad. So, overall, how would you say the renewable sector is reacting to these proposals and to this ongoing policy debate and the prospect for legislation being passed? I guess I would say overall, there's cautious optimism, but there's so many moving parts, and it's so hard to tell where things are going to settle. People are generally avoiding doing a lot of number crunching around hypotheticals and, well, what if it's this, what if it's that, because it's just too hard to know. There is, and it's fantastic, there is a lot of support for green energy tax credits, and I think we will see some expansion and some extension of the tax credits, but as to where it settles, we don't know. So, I don't think anybody's making a whole lot of bets that this is definitely going to pass, so I'm going to go a corner of a battery market so that I'm in the pole position when this passes. I don't think anybody's doing that, but I also don't think anybody's just completely ignoring it. Certainly, as I do deals and draft and negotiate tax equity documents, there are various contingencies to deal with these proposals passing or not passing. So, right now, everybody's tried to be prepared for whatever happens, which is good for lawyers, but not so good for the industry in terms of the time it takes and the expense of not having predictability. Oftentimes, business people say what's best for business is long-term predictability and stability so you can make plans. Well, at the moment, I think people are planning optimistically, but nobody really knows which version and flavor of these proposals we're going to end up with. Well, David, thank you for that rundown. It's been really interesting and obviously a lot to follow in the coming days and weeks. And, David, thank you for coming on Crossroads today. This has been great. Thank you, Andrew. I've enjoyed speaking with you. Appreciate the opportunity. And thank you all for tuning in. This has been the Crossroads Podcast.

I'm Matt O'Brien, reporter, news editor for Information News North American Coverage. I'll be your host today. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce our guest today. Someone's going to give us his view on the broadband infrastructure landscape. I have with me a partner on the TMT team at Searchlight Capital Partners, and former Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai. Ajit, welcome. Ajit Pai Hey, it's great to be with you, Matt. Thanks for making the time. Matt O'Brien Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. So most of us saw back in April, the Searchlight announcement that you were joining the firm. I thought we would start off with you telling the listeners, what have you been working on? And, you know, have your impressions of the market changed since joining Searchlight? Ajit Pai Well, first of all, thanks again, Matt, for taking the time. I've really appreciated the work that you and Information News have done over the years to help educate those of us in this space and look forward to a great conversation today. Speaking of Searchlight, one of the things that intrigued me after I left the FCC and as I started exploring my different options was that Searchlight was composed of a really extraordinary group of individuals. Over a decade, they've built a private equity platform that has really been successful in terms of assets under management or some of the acquisitions and deals they've done. And certainly, the culture they've built over that decade has been one that's very collaborative and teamwork oriented. And all of those things have been confirmed in my couple of months at the firm. I've had the chance to work on a couple of different transactions, most notably All Points Broadband in the state of Virginia. And there too, it's been exciting to get under the hood, so to speak, of some of these innovative businesses, understand what makes them tick, where value might be added, and then try to figure out a way where we can add value. And I've really been excited at the opportunity. And also, it's been an education for me. I don't have the traditional financial background, of course, but it's been great getting to obviously apply the traditional tools of finance to some of these great opportunities out there in the infrastructure space. Great. The way I want to start this conversation is on mergers and acquisitions activity and where you see that going. For me, I've been covering the telecom sector since roughly 2018. I saw a lot of activity through that infrastructure lens in 2019. And then the second half of 2020, obviously, the first half, we can all agree, was a bit challenging. The first half of this year, a lot of activity still. But then recently, it feels like things have cooled off a little bit, again, just from the infrastructure perspective. So if that's a fact, will an activity continue and set a new range in trading activity? Or do you see something else? It's a very good question. So I think in years past, when we talked about M&A, we might have had in mind straightforward acquisition with no material changes in the businesses being acquired. But now, I'm not sure about the overall volume, but I can say that the tenor of these investments has seemed to have changed. For example, you see a lot of entities, either private equity companies or strategics, acquiring some of these telecom companies and then pouring in capital in order to upgrade infrastructure. And so I think the nature of the acquisitions has certainly changed compared to even a few years ago. And I think the COVID pandemic, candidly, has probably driven some of that. I think COVID, at least here in the United States and likely around the world, has underscored the importance of broadband in the lives of consumers everywhere, to be able to work from home, for your kids to be able to do remote learning, for you to have a remote visit with your doctor, even for farmers, for example, to be able to do precision agriculture, all those other kinds of things. You need a broadband connection. And so I think now, both investment firms and strategics are recognizing that there's a great opportunity here, even if the companies themselves that are being acquired don't have fiber, for example. If they have some sort of infrastructure that can be leveraged, you increase the amount of capital expenditures pouring into the upgrades, and hey, you've got a pretty good investment opportunity there. So I'm not sure I would defer to you in terms of the absolute level, but I would say that the nature of those investments has certainly changed over time. Yeah, gotcha. And on that note, let's dive in just a little bit deeper. One of the things people are talking about, you go to these conferences, telecom conferences, communications infrastructure seminars, and sometimes a conversation comes up with the convergence between your enterprise-focused firms and that of residential. And think of all your fiber-to-the-home players that have popped up in the last few years are just super focused on residential. Yeah, I mean, sure, they serve maybe a small business here and there that make up their total customer base, but they're really uber-focused on the residential aspect and on customer service. And I think these enterprise-focused carriers are taking notice of a lot of the success that they're having. Do you see some kind of convergence between those two business models? Because there are important distinctions between the two, especially from a contractual basis that they have through their customers. But do you see those business models converging? Do you see that accelerating, taking off? What's your view on that? That's a great question. So I certainly see that some of the more enterprise-focused firms are recognizing the value in residential and even more so the reverse that some of the traditional residential, for example, fiber-to-the-home players are seeing a value on the enterprise side. And so to the extent that they're delivering, for example, fiber-to-the-home to every home residence in a jurisdiction, to the extent that certain businesses are on the way, I mean, you see a great revenue opportunity there to leverage an already existing network, both middle-mile and last-mile, to be able to capture some of that value. I also think that in the time to come, we're obviously in the early stages of the next wireless revolution, 5G, but 5G is going to require much deeper fiber penetration. In addition to that, you're going to need a lot more small cells operating at lower power, but those small cells will also have to be connected with fiber. And so I actually think there's going to be a convergence with the residential and enterprise fiber providers with respect to 5G, because the same fiber that's being used in a neighborhood can be used to leverage a 5G network. So I do think that in the time to come, we'll see fiber as one of those technologies that unites both the enterprise and the residential sides. So let's dive into particulars of Greenfield activity. You know, while there might have been a lull in M&A, or maybe the sector is just digesting some of that activity, it certainly continued at a frenzy pace in Greenfield. You know, a lot of public infrastructure procurements seem to have been put on pause in what information covers, whether it be a core or core plus assets. I think they're all waiting to see what comes out of the infrastructure bill. But you know, when I'm looking every day, it feels like there's some kind of new procurement, public procurement going on, where a municipality, a state, they're looking for some kind of network build out, whether it's fiber to the home, or maybe a middle mile. Every day, we're seeing something new. So what do you see, given all this activity, what do you see as opportunities for infrafunds and other investors in the Greenfield space? That's a $64,000 question these days. There are so many tailwinds for these types of Greenfield bills. And we track the same news that you're tracking, and it's incredible. And I think what it speaks to is the fact that across the country, at all levels of government, national, state, local, and even tribal, there is a dissatisfaction with the fact that the digital divide has persisted for so long. And certainly, when I ran the FCC, one of our goals was to allocate public resources to the maximum extent feasible to target those unserved areas, and in addition, to modernize our regulatory framework in order to make it easier to build in some of these areas that didn't have broadband. And some of the more arcane regulatory reforms that the average person might not know about, but that are really critical to building a broadband network, for example, one-touch make ready to make it cheaper and quicker to gain access to utility pools for competitive fiber providers, or making it easier for telephone companies to migrate some of their infrastructure from copper to fiber. And now, I think that's only continued ever since I left the FCC. You see now these massive funding streams. The American Rescue Plan, for example, is devoting billions of dollars to states, and uniquely now, states are taking some of that funding and making it specifically available for broadband deployment. The broadband infrastructure framework, which you talked about, I mean, my gosh, if you told me back in 2017, when I gave a speech as FCC chairman, urging Congress to allocate significant funds for broadband as part of an infrastructure plan, if you told me that you'd get bipartisan agreement on the $65 billion, at least $40 billion of which would be for broadband deployment, I would have been doing cartwheels. And so I think it suggests that there's now a recognition in Washington that this is really important. And I think why that's important for Greenfield in particular is that here in the United States, just as around the world, there have always been certain areas where established providers don't see a business case for deployment. It might be that the populations in those areas are relatively sparse. It might also be that those areas have relatively lower incomes. It could also be topographical. There might be mountains, for example, or I've been to parts of Alaska that are in permafrost. You can't lay a fiber line. And so I think one of the great things about these funding streams coming from Washington and the states is they finally give uplift to some of the infrastructure funds, some of the telecom providers that are finally finding that the math works in some of these areas. And so I'm really optimistic about what that will mean for infrastructure going forward. And we'll simply point out as well that the consumer demand is clearly there. I've traveled to 49 states and the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands over the last several years. And I can tell you that those consumers who don't have broadband, it's not because they don't want it. They really do. And they finally see an opportunity now to get on the right side of the digital divide. So in addition to the business side of things, which of course is important as we've discussed. So I think in addition to this being good as a business opportunity, which is of course the subject of our conversation, there's a tremendous social benefit here. I think coming out of COVID-19, I think I'm hard pressed to think of a better example of an ESG related benefit than bringing people who were for too long on the wrong side of the digital divide into the digital era. And so I think there's a great opportunity here for not just individual consumers to be better off, but for communities and national economies to be stronger. Yeah. Gotcha. Great point. Thank you. Thank you for that. I know that you guys procure a broadband project as a publicly financed municipal network, something for more of my colleagues at DebtWire Municipals. Do you think that when the municipality or in the state decides to procure a network that way, all using all public funds and it'll be publicly owned, government owned, do you think that that caps private investor opportunities? It seems to be a raging debate right now, right? Being municipal owned or P3 or completely privately owned in finance, or if it's all publicly owned, is there still room for such projects where investors can participate? Well, I think the way I would answer that is that I certainly understand the motivation underlying the push for municipal broadband or for wholly owned government operated networks. And I think part of the problem is, however, that then you do end up crowding out some of the private investment that is very eager to build and operate some of these broadband networks. And so I think the most effective model has been one akin to what Virginia has done, the state of Virginia. So there, for example, they've established a framework, not just devoting state funds through the American Rescue Plan and on its own for broadband deployment, but they've also changed the law to allow utilities, electric utilities, to build middle mile fiber and to essentially amortize the cost of that build over the rate base. And in addition to that, they've encouraged electric utilities and internet service providers to work together. And so what we see coming together in the state of Virginia is a very unique public private partnership model in which you have everybody aligned, state government officials, for example, electric utilities, internet service providers, and in the case of Searchlight and AllPoints, a private capital provider. And so all of us are working together to solve that problem of how do we get universal service in areas that just don't have broadband right now. We think that's a much more effective model. The track record for municipal broadband has been a little bit spotty. I've visited some great municipal broadband projects, for example, in Lorenz, Iowa, a very small town where no provider was willing to build. But there have also been stories, for example, like Provo, Utah, where the city spent tens of millions of dollars on a broadband network and ended up selling it to Google for $1. And so I think at the end of the day, what we want to do is to make sure that we maximize the benefit to those tech consumers and as taxpayers and as consumers for these broadband networks. And I think the public private partnership model is a better way to achieve that worthy goal than wholly government-owned and operated networks. Yeah, that's a great point. It's interesting to see how these different actors are partnering up. And that's a point you make about partnering with the electric co-ops. We're certainly seeing a lot of that. Given your background in government, helming the FCC and working around Washington, I have to ask you some policy-oriented questions. What broadband elements should the current Congress and White House add to the infrastructure bill that we're all on the edge of our seats watching, waiting with bated breath? If you were still part of the D.C. machinery, what would you like to see added to that bill? What would you push for? Boy, that's a good question. So obviously, now that I'm out of the game, so to speak, I have a little more freedom to think broadly and speak broadly about what I would put into it. Were I still in office, I would say, of course, I defer to Congress on whatever they choose to do is what they choose to do, and we'll dutifully administer it. I do think that the broad contours of it have to be very thoughtfully structured. And so, for example, my own preference would be for Congress to allocate funding through the FCC, which has existing mechanisms for distributing that funding, as opposed to another government agency, either the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, or some other federal agency. The FCC is the nation's premier communications agency, has been administering the Universal Service Fund for many years, and I would have some concern about pouring tens of billions of dollars into a Department of Commerce agency, for example, that doesn't have broad experience distributing funding, has never held a spectrum auction or a Universal Service Fund auction or other type of auction market mechanism for distributing funding. And also, the FCC knows all of these players in the various states, it's also developing the granular maps, the broadband maps that will be necessary for determining which areas are served and unserved or underserved. And so, that's point number one. Point number two is that I would encourage Congress to think about giving the FCC flexibility in terms of structuring the distribution of this funding. It could be grants, it could be loans, it could be just a straightforward auction as the USF funds have traditionally been, but you give the expert agency the ability to tweak these distribution mechanisms according to the necessities of the time. And the final thing is I would ensure that there's accountability on the back end. It was very important to me when I ran the FCC to make sure that we made clear to all the recipients of this funding, look, we're not simply cutting a check and saying, you know, by a condios, we want you to use the scarce taxpayer funding for the benefit of American consumers. And whether it's enmeshed specifically within the law or whether the Congress simply says to the FCC, you shall establish regulations on accountability, that would be very important as well. And so, I think those are some of the broad outlines. In terms of the funding amount, I certainly think that that seems to be a number that I've heard in terms of attacking the unserved part of the country. And that's probably the last point I would raise is that the last thing we want to do through these government mechanisms like the infrastructure program is to, number one, either target areas that already have service and or number two, fund overbuilding of privately built and operated networks. I mean, to the extent that somebody already has broadband from a private provider, the last thing the government should be doing is I think coming over the top and spending taxpayer funds overbuilding that network. So I would target the unserved part of the country, which tends to be underserved if not unserved completely. And these areas are going to be very, very difficult to connect otherwise in the years to come. So those are just a few of the things I would think about. And I'm quite sure that these are topics that are being debated hotly right now in the halls of the United States Senate. Right. Yeah, I bet. Let me ask you this. How do you see the current thinking at the FCC impacting broadband infra activity? Yeah, I think broadly speaking, we're all the same. They were all on the same page when I was running the agency and they continue to be. I think that people recognize that all of these different programs the FCC runs are important. The universal service one is one of them, but even some of the other ones that in terms of making sure the broadband was more available, you know, one touch make ready, which I mentioned earlier, I mean, that was a unanimous decision, which was a pretty big deal, given the political environment in Washington, some of the other things, encouraging the migration from copper to fiber. These are things that people tend to agree on. So going forward, I would expect the FCC to be focused very much on those types of consensus based policies. Now, there are going to be areas where, you know, obviously people differ. Some of these issues are very challenging politically, but nonetheless, I think in terms of the broad strokes, people are going to be on the same page. And even as I was leaving and the new administration was taking over, we saw some of that continuity in terms of some of the affordability of provision. So for example, I encouraged Congress in my last couple of months to extend funding for consumers who were unable to pay because of difficulties caused by the pandemic. Congress established that authority in late December, and it ended up becoming the Emergency Broadband Benefit, or EBB, three to four billion dollar program that the current FCC adopted unanimously. So I think broadband might be one of the few things in Washington that unifies people regardless of political affiliation. And I say lead into that. I hope the FCC now and going into the future will continue to focus on those types of consensus oriented policies. Yeah, gotcha. I have one last question. I think I'm going a little bit out of order here. I wanted to back up, but maybe going back more to the greenfield, I can see it even affecting M&A. The pandemic has obviously challenged supply chain issues and logistics. What, you know, when you look at these fiber providers and even the workforce, you know, people not returning to work, are these presenting a challenge to various fiber operators and investors? What's your what's your take on that? I certainly hear anecdotally and we're starting to see in terms of prices and timing that there are certain supply chain issues with respect to equipment and even workforce issues, as you mentioned. And, you know, with respect to the first, you know, certainly what I've been hearing, at least in seeing, is that the purchase orders take a lot longer to come to fruition. You might see in many cases as well that you might see an increased price for some of the fiber if you're not ordering at scale. And in terms of the workforce as well, you know, one of the things I noticed when I was at the FCC, well before anyone heard of COVID-19, is that the work of building a fiber network, any communications network, is exceptionally difficult. You know, I've actually sat on a ditch, which in the muck of Louisiana's bayous and strung fiber, I've climbed a utility pole and a 130 foot pole to check a wireless antenna. I mean, this is really hard work. And, you know, there are very few people who are qualified to do it. And so now, of course, as we've been discussing, there's not just a massive influx of capital and interest, but there's a massive influx of need for the people to be able to do that work. And so hopefully as things start to open up a little bit, we'll see where the Delta variant takes us. But I certainly hope that that workforce is not going to be a constraint on the building of some of these communications networks going forward. But there's no question now, we've seen activity in this space on the greenfield side that is unlike anything I've ever seen, probably since the late 90s when we first saw this rush towards the construction of digital infrastructure. So the next couple of years are going to be very critical. And here's hoping that all the pieces fit together because time is not on the side of American consumers waiting for that digital opportunity. All right. I know we're running up against the clock here and pressed for time. Any last thoughts before we sign off? No, I think this is a very unique time in the digital infrastructure space. You know better than I do, having viewed this market and many others as well. But for the first time, I think we do have almost a universal alignment among all of the players in the Internet economy about the importance of digital infrastructure. And so for me, at least, it's a very exciting time. Obviously, very exciting time for me to be at Searchlight, but even more generally as an American citizen who grew up in a rural area, I'm really excited about what this will mean for people who have just been waiting for a chance to participate in the digital economy. So I think the next couple of years are going to be very critical, not just for investors and for providers, but also for consumers. And here's hoping we can get the job done as Americans to make this a better place for everybody. Well said. All right, Ajit, thank you for your time. Well, that was the one and the only Ajit Pai from Searchlight Capital Partners. I want to thank our audience for listening to the podcast.

My name is Kyle Yonker. I'm the editor for Sparkspread North America. I'm joined today by Rob West, the founder and CEO and himself an analyst at Thundersaid Energy. I first heard Rob speak on a panel in December in which he made some very thought-provoking comments about the energy transition and ever since then I've wanted to interview him to delve deeper into some of his ideas and research. Thanks for talking to me today, Rob. Hey, thanks for having me. Great to be with you, Kyle. So as I said, Rob has some very thought-provoking ideas backed by compelling research and I think this conversation can be a good jumping-off point for our audience of financial advisors, lawyers, developers, bankers and investors to dive deeper into some of these ideas and your research in particular. So your research firm, founded in 2019, recently hit a milestone of publishing 2,000 pages of research and to commemorate the occasion, this month you put together a report on your top 10 controversies in the energy transition and that list and your ideas regarding these controversies, as you're calling them, are going to form the core of today's podcast. Before we get to that, I just wanted to ask you about your research approach because what I've seen is that you're doing sort of deep-dive analysis on issues or companies or technologies and you're combining it with an analysis of patents, which is something I've never seen before. So I just wanted to see if you could take us through your research approach and why you think it's important to consider patents. Well, I think we're all trying to figure this thing called energy transition out and we're all in the same boat, that nobody is an expert in this stuff because it doesn't exist yet. And we're kind of, you know, throughout the entire community of decision makers, to some extent, making it up as we go along of how we're going to meet the energy needs of the world and taking out all of the CO2. So a lot of the technologies that we're looking at to get the world to net zero are early stage. And what I found in my time as an analyst, if you talk to a charismatic CEO of an early stage company, they're convinced it will work by tomorrow and they just need a little bit more capital and it will be perfect. What I found with patents, to get granted a patent, you have to start by telling the world what industrial problem you are trying to solve. And so in the patents, people tend to be very forthcoming about their problems. And I like that because, you know, really, I think what we're all trying to do as decision makers in this space is find the areas that are going to have the fewest problems. And that's where patents I've found really helpful. Okay, so let's jump into the 10 controversies. Here they are, as Rob has laid them out. Inflation, geopolitics, new energies, costs, renewables, grid backups, green hydrogen, nature-based solutions, oil and gas, hidden opportunities, and finally SPACs and technologies. So number one is inflation. The International Energy Agency recently published a roadmap for reaching net zero emissions, which you calculate will cost $400 a ton on average per ton of global CO2 abated. You say that this is 10 times more expensive than your own roadmap to net zero. And the IE model, you say, would also lead to dangerous inflation. Can you just take us through how your net zero model differs from the IEA model? Yeah, the biggest difference is that the IEA model isn't really trying to get the world to net zero, it's trying to get the world to zero fossil fuels. And they're totally different things. So when we talk about net zero in the thunderstorm energy model, we want to meet, you know, 100,000 terawatt hours of annual energy demand in a system that puts net zero CO2 into the atmosphere. You can still use low cost, efficient, well run oil and gas in that mix, you just have to make sure that you either capture the CO2 or you offset it by nature based solutions like like reforestation or getting carbon into soils. The IEA roadmap kind of goes a little bit further and says how do we meet the energy needs of the world with zero oil and gas and because of that, it's much more heavily weighted towards really building out renewables to the levels where the volatility gets really hard to manage. And pathways like hydrogen, which are just very, very expensive and back to our patents, have some elephant traps and issues hidden in there that maybe some people aren't thinking about. Number two is geopolitics. You foresee the potential for tensions to rise between developed nations that now want to decarbonize and the rest of the world that is developing and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. What do you think is the most likely endgame here and why? Well, I'm worried about it. I started Thunderset Energy because the idea of climate change was keeping me up at night. There's something else keeping me up at night much more these days. And it's this, you know, how's the world going to work if we bend over backwards in the developed world to decarbonize our economies and we get to net zero and India, China and Africa keep growing their emissions and then they say, nah, we don't really care about that. You're on your own in the West. We'll just keep emitting. You know, what are Western policymakers going to do in that world? And I don't think we have a good answer to that other than putting in border taxes. But the only historic analogy I can find that looks remotely similar is what happened with the abolitionist movement in the United States in the 1830s, 40s and 50s. And I think there's some really big questions about whether the world wants to go down that route. Yeah. So the next one you say here could potentially pull us back from this trajectory. That's new energies costs. You say the cost of new energies could go down so much that the developing world could jump straight into these clean technologies. What are the dynamics influencing potential deflation of these technologies? And what do you think are the most promising? Well, the debate here is, do costs go down and down and down or up and up and up for new energies? And the fear that I have from having built over 130 models around this is that at some point, the cost of new energy is going to start going up again. And where that point is, is when we try and decarbonize the making of new energies themselves. So I'll give you an example. You know, one kilogram of photovoltaic silicon emits 140 kilograms of CO2 when it's made, principally in China using coal power. So if you were to decarbonize making the solar panels, the cost would stop falling and they would reinflate, they'd probably double from where they were in, you know, 2019 prior to COVID. And that that's the challenge is that when you start having to decarbonize everything in this, you know, 5 trillion a year map, like the copper and the steel and the, well, everything, then you get these inflationary feedback loops coming through. And so maybe instead of costs going down and down and down and down, there's fears they might start going back up again. One of the most interesting things that I've seen you write about is the optimal share of renewables in decarbonized 2050 power grids. Can you just go over your views on that and why you think this range of 40 to 50% is the optimal share? Sure. If you plot the data of all the wind farms offshore in the UK, you'll have three days where they're generating flat out, and they're all generating flat out at exactly the same time. And then you'll have somewhere between two and 10 days where they don't generate at all. And that volatility is really hard to backstop. People talk about, oh, it's easy. We'll just put some batteries into the grid, model the size of how big those batteries would have to be to backstop 10 days plus. And you just can't do it. At least you just can't do it without going back to the previous controversy, you know, costs just starting to get out of control. So I think the right answer is to stop at 40 to 50. With the remaining power needing to come from nuclear, geothermal, blue hydrogen, and carbon offset natural gas. Exactly right. Okay, that leads us to number five here, which is backing up a renewables heavy grid. You say that grid scale batteries and hydrogen are ineffective. Instead, you say demand shifting is a vastly better option. How do we implement a system for demand shifting at the scale required? Well, as usual, you read my comments to me, and I agree with myself. Demand shifting is the best option. So if I need something to store up the renewables and re-release them, it's going to cost me money because I have to build a thing. And it's going to have an efficiency loss because of the second law of thermodynamics. Instead, if I move my electric vehicle charging to when the renewables are generating, it basically costs me nothing because it's something I was going to do anyway. And that principle doesn't just apply to electric vehicle charging, which is a simple, easy way to understand it. It could apply from everything from electric arc furnaces in the steel industry, through to data centers, through to ICT technologies, through to desalination plants. I think about 20% of mature grids could end up being demand flexible like that. And that's companies that can do this, can do it right, just going to start printing money, because there's going to be about a third of the time when renewables mean power prices are zero or even negative, and about a third of the time when power prices go through the roof, because renewables are not generating. Somebody's got to be the marginal person to switch off. So a steel company could essentially operate when these power prices are low, very low or negative. You got it. Exactly right. Okay. Number six here is green hydrogen. Yeah, I will just quote you a little bit more here. You say no other theme in the energy transition has attracted more hype than hydrogen. Is this the ultimate transition fuel? I think the more green hydrogen I put into my models, the less decarbonization I get. If I start with 100 megawatt hours of renewable energy, I want to displace 100 megawatt hours of coal. If I make that 100 megawatt hours of renewable energy into hydrogen, I have a big efficiency loss. I'd only get to displace 50 megawatt hours of coal. There are issues around the cost. There's issues around technology readiness. This could be a one and a half hour session if we talk just about green hydrogen. So let's leave that one there. Nature-based carbon offsets are number seven. Well, they're the most exciting to me. So I think you could do about three billion acres of reforestation and about five tons of CO2 per acre per year. That's a 15 billion ton per year carbon sink. Last year, I offset my own CO2 emissions 10 times over. I actually believe in this so much that I'm starting my own reforestation project over here and, you know, going to offset my own lifetime of CO2 emissions. That's very interesting. We might have to come back to that one or save it for round two of the podcast. So let's go to number eight here, which is oil and gas. In your roadmap to net zero, what is the role of oil and gas? Well, if they can provide energy that can be carbon offset and not have any emissions go into the atmosphere on a net basis, then I think they have a very good future in the future energy system. And so I have about 85 million barrels a day of oil and about 375 TCF a year of gas in a fully decarbonized, fully modeled energy system in 2050. And, you know, if I look at decarbonizing somewhere like China, the biggest bottleneck to actually doing this is that we can't get enough gas into China to displace coal, which is 65 percent of the total energy mix. So I have a lot of oil and gas in this roadmap. And each megawatt hour that we generate from natural gas is only one third of the CO2 is from coal. So those megawatt hours to come from somewhere, we've got to get them from the low carbon places. And of course, there's not a free pass for the gas industry. We've still got to catch all of the methane leaks and we've got to capture the CO2 and offset the CO2. OK, we've got two more to get to here. Number nine is hidden opportunities. Underneath the veneer of some of the hot themes in the energy transition, you see some of these hidden opportunities. What are some of your top picks today? I think there's just so many to go into that I don't want to go into any one or two things because then I'll feel bad for the other ones that I didn't mention. So let's save that one for another time. Let's go to the last one, SPACs and technologies. You note here that 360 new companies have come to the market in 2021 as SPACs, the largest category being New Energies. You're talking about risking these companies in the right way. So can you just take us through what type of risking you think is appropriate? Well, I've always thought when we're looking at these new technology companies, you know, you want to figure out is the technology real? Does it work? And often all you have to go on is a kind of glossy presentation pulled together by the company. So I like when I go through the patents, I look for five things. I want to see, you know, what specific challenges do the company claim to have solved? If there's an issue that, I don't know, that your fuel cells generally don't tend to work very well when it's too humid or too dry, is that the area where you've got the killer breakthrough? What is it? Two, how specific is the solution? You know, not a sort of vague, we've solved all the problems of the world in our magic mystery box, but here is a specific thing we are building. Here is how we're doing it. And you can lay that out in the patents because that's what a patent is. Then can you understand it? You know, because I always find the best way to de-risk something is when I can wrap my head around it. Whereas the things that are just unintelligible, full stop, I think are more of a punt than an investment. So those are the top three things that I look at and we tend to score companies on those dimensions based on going through all their patents. And I always say that you sort of spend a hundred minutes reading patents a little bit bored. But then the one minute where you figure out like the really crucial eureka moment, it kind of makes the entire exercise worthwhile. So I guess one thing I try and do is invest those hundred minutes and just share with people the one minute eureka moment and give them the bit they really need to know. But there are some amazing opportunities. I mean, I'm sorry, you know, this short format isn't the right way to explore them all. But there are just some truly incredible opportunities coming through to get the transition done. And I guess thinking back on the things we've talked about, I just want to point out it was called the top 10 controversies in the energy transition for a reason. So if some of this sounds controversial, especially in the very brief showing we gave it today, then I guess I should say that is by design. Yes, exactly. We want this to be a jumping off point and we thank you very much for being with us. Well, thanks for covering so much ground in such a short amount of time and great talking with you. And I hope we can we can go into the weeds on a separate occasion. Absolutely.

I'm Jon Burke, Americas Editor for Information News. Joining me on today's program is Brent Burnett, Co-Head of Real Assets for Hamilton Lane, and Jonathan Carmody, Editor of our Latin America team. Welcome to the podcast, gentlemen. Thanks, Jon. Nice to be here with you today. Always a pleasure, JB. So Hamilton Lane is a global private markets investment management firm with $667 billion in assets under management and advisement. On the infrastructure side, they work with clients on a discretionary basis and also do advisory work with pension funds on real assets allocations. So 2020, for obvious reasons, saw a big drop-off from third-party fundraisers from 2019 and 2018 in terms of infrastructure funds. Overall, though, there was over $200 billion or so raised during that three-year period, which saw two global flagship funds, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners 4 and Global Infrastructure Partners 4, exceed the $20 billion threshold. Third-party managers also sought to whet the appetite of LPs eager to increase allocations to infrastructure in other ways, such as infrastructure credit platforms, geographic-specific vehicles, and energy transition funds. Brent joins us today to reflect on the fund landscape and what the rest of 2021 might look like. Brent, before we get into specifics, it seems like there's a mandate to get a large infrastructure bill passed by Independence Day. I'd like to get your general view on what the Biden infrastructure plan looks like and what specific sectors it will impact. Yeah, sure, John. It's a good question. We're fielding this question frequently from clients as well. As you know, there appears to be bipartisan support for getting something done. I think, you know, ultimately what the bill will look like may be pretty different from what's been proposed, but if you just take the plan as proposed, I think there are some sectors within infrastructure that are likely to benefit from it, and there are others that I think it will be, you know, either neutral to even slightly negative. And so, if you kind of look across the sectors that have specific spending allocations that are allocated to them, you know, transportation and water, those have been subsectors within infrastructure, at least here in North America, that have been pretty small targets for private infrastructure funds. There have been some PPPs done in that space, but they have been relatively few. And generally, where the private capital has benefited has been from projects where there's a lack of federal spending available to fund those projects. So, if we see the federal government come in in scale into some of these sectors, like transportation, like water, I think there is some risk to crowding out some of the limited opportunities that have been available to private capital that have primarily worked through state and local governments on those PPPs. So, I think transportation and water, depending on how that spending plan is structured, could be neutral to slightly negative for private capital. On the sectors that I think are potentially positioned to benefit from it, data telecom, specifically rural broadband, electricity in terms of electric vehicles, transmission, distribution, those are sectors that have sizable allocations for spending. They've been good sectors for private capital. I think it's unlikely that the federal government takes a directly competitive role with private capital in those sectors and will more likely look to either backstop loans or provide incentives to consumers to select their provider. And I think that approach will, on balance, be potentially very positive for private infrastructure capital. The last sector on the social infrastructure side, this has been a small target for infrastructure investors in the U.S. as well, much larger target in Europe. I think it will depend on the form that the federal government takes in terms of how it approaches this. If they take a model that's similar to what we've seen in European countries, where consumers have some choice about which care facilities they choose and the level of service, while the government essentially backstops the bill, while setting service standards, I think if they take that model, that could be positive for private capital. So, you know, I think we're all watching it intently to see how it comes out. And but if you take it as it's laid out today, I think there are going to be some winners and losers that are created from it. Yeah, and I think ostensibly it seems like the Republicans want a scaled down version of the bill, which sort of almost like bypasses what Biden was targeting in terms of clean energy initiatives and actually settling around transportation as being the core focus of what they'd like to see in a scaled down version. You have two different agendas and they're going to have to meet in the middle somewhere. Yeah, I think that's true. And I think, you know, at least some of the early moves that the Biden administration has moved on, has made on the renewable sector have been a positive in terms of looking to speed permitting for offshore wind, federally backstopping some of those loans and offshore wind projects, potentially providing some more permanent subsidies to wind and solar or tax credit. So I do think that there is some grounds for some grounds for compromise there. But as you note, the one sector that I think has benefited most from some federal intervention here has been on the renewable side. And it'll it'll be interesting to see how that gets impacted. Excellent. Thanks for that. What I alluded to earlier, again, about these different vehicles that we and others have been writing about over the past couple of years, LPs have a lot of choices today in terms of increasing their real assets or infrastructure allocation. And this obviously goes beyond infrastructure into other forms like real estate, for instance. Just from your experience, what type of funds do you see are making an impact and why are they making an impact? Yeah, I think there's a couple of things happening. And and, you know, as you know, this is an asset class that has that has grown almost exponentially over the last 10 years. You know, our data suggests that 10 years ago it was roughly one percent of a five hundred billion dollar private markets asset class. Today, it's roughly eight percent of a six and a half trillion dollar private markets asset class. So the growth in infrastructure allocations has really been significant over over the last 10 years. You know, on that set, I think there's sort of a natural evolution of this asset class in that we're seeing a lot more choices offered to LPs in terms of how they approach their infrastructure portfolio construction. So as as you noted, the mega funds have moved up in size, obviously, over the last few years. They had very strong fundraisers in 2019. That, I think, is partially why you saw lower activity in 2020 is because a lot of those mega funds had had had come to market in 2018 and 2019 and weren't really in the market in 2019 and 2020. But at the same time, I think where we're seeing some growth in new opportunities has been in sector specific funds that are around the data and telecom space that are attracting a lot of institutional capital. We're also seeing a growth in the number of offerings in the small to mid market infrastructure space. So, you know, this is this actually from information's data. If you look at where the number of transactions that that occurred in 2020, about 75 percent of the number of transactions were below 500 million of enterprise value. And so you think about the fundraising as being strongest in that larger end of the market. But the liquidity of the infrastructure assets is actually much greater on that smaller end of the market. And so we've seen more small to mid-sized focus funds targeting, you know, anywhere from 500 million to a billion and a half dollars of capital be launched this year in response to what is is kind of a dearth of capital availability for those small to mid-sized deals. Great, interesting points there. Moving on to ESG, there remains a very important buzzword in investing in general, but let's talk about it at the base level from the view of the pension funds. What are you seeing today in terms of how ESG is affecting investment strategy as it pertains to real assets? Yeah, I think, you know, as you know, this is a critical piece to institutional investing today, and it's not just enough to have a policy. Groups that are coming to market to raise capital, they need to have a very robust ESG policy, but they have to be able to look through that to to show institutions how they are measuring and monitoring specific ESG criteria within their portfolios. And so I think we're sort of moving beyond the implementing ESG at a screening phase and moving toward being able to monitor specific ESG criteria within portfolios. And that's what institutions are starting to expect now. I think that, you know, the easiest one to focus on is the environmental piece because it's a little bit more quantifiable. But I think institutions are really trying to take a comprehensive view of the environmental, the social and the governance aspects of those policies such that, you know, even an upstream energy strategy, for example, that may rank negatively on the environmental side, they still need to be able to show that they are mitigating the environmental effects to the extent that they can. And they have a robust policy with respect to social and governance issues if they want to have any chance of raising capital in today's markets. And that's that's that's very true for infrastructure funds as well that have historically been heavy on the midstream infrastructure side. It's just it's critical to fundraising today and it's no longer nice to have. It's a must have for the institutional market. I think early on when we were covering this from the perspective of the investor or the LP, there was always a question about what was governing their ESG, you know, was it was their metric metrics like Gresby? So I'm kind of wondering, you know, what the evolution's been there. Has there been a more common metric adopted and more people opted into Gresby as a metric? Yeah, we're seeing more more institutions adopt Gresby, most more so in Europe, John, than what we've seen in North America. It's it's really it's really become in many ways a standard. And and in fact, when we're when we're looking at new opportunities or even pursuing new business in certain European markets, it's a requirement to have either Gresby or some other reporting capability on on the ESG function. So I think, you know, Gresby has kind of emerged as the standard in in Europe. I think we're starting to see it a little bit more in North America, but it's not it is not to date a requirement like we see in other markets. There are some other providers out there as well that are trying to solve this issue. And fundamentally, what these service providers are about is is being able to quantify and monitor the ESG compliance, the ESG impact of the underlying assets in a portfolio. So, you know, this is what I mean when when I say we're trying to move from incorporating ESG into a diligence approach from and taking a step further in integrating ESG into monitoring and services like Gresby help to do that. Are there any newer metrics that US LPs are looking at right now or is it more the sense than getting used to Gresby? Yeah, I think I think, you know, Gresby is one one provider. I there I think institutions in North America are are starting to look for what the specific metrics should be in their ESG policies that they can measure and monitor. I think first they're trying to define what those metrics are and what the standards are that they will hold their underlying GPs to. And and then they will look to identify, you know, what what provider it is that they will require to monitor those. So, you know, I think Gresby is sort of out in front given its footprint in Europe. But but but I can't say that that's been the only service or the only way that groups in North America have looked at it. Moving to just some of these energy centric funds that are out there and have raised a ton of capital over the last decade, have you seen ESG sort of impact LP's relationships with these fund managers and how how has it changed? How has it forced them to change their approach? What have you seen from the GPs in these kind of relationships that have focused on energy for so long and now are being forced to adopt somewhat by ESG standards or LP's different approaches to this? Yeah, I think it's a it's an interesting and natural evolution to where their strategies have been in the past. And I think the groups that are have been poised to really benefit from this and and I say benefit, but what I should say is is those groups that can more easily pivot to these energy transition strategies have been the more diversified energy focused funds. So, you know, if you if you were a pure upstream production oriented fund, it's very difficult to, I think, transition into an energy energy transition type strategy. But some of the more diversified energy managers, I think, have been successful at transitioning their approach to focus more on the energy transition theme. And I think this is driven by a couple of things, Don. It's not just ESG, although that is a big driver here, but one of the very practical drivers is that institutions have been very underwhelmed by the returns that they've experienced in their historical upstream strategies. So they've seen a lot of volatility there. They've seen limited distributions coming back now for nearly 10 years from those strategies. And in addition to that, you have a new ESG policy, which is really driven by the desire to fully quantify all of the risks that are inherent in a strategy. And so I think you take the combination of the poor returns, the lower distribution, plus an additional risk overlay through an ESG policy. And it's natural that institutions are migrating away from a more volatile upstream type approach. And so this has created a market for these energy transition funds that are really looking to provide bridge capital to these types of companies that are helping with this electrification trend in North America and globally. And we think it's a pretty interesting space because many of these companies in the energy transition space, they're not quite ready for infrastructure capital in the sense that they may have some technology risk, they may have some business model risk, they may need to scale their manufacturing capability, they may need to diversify their customer mix. But once they sort of get through that growth phase and really start to function as an infrastructure provider, there's a lot of ready capital that will be available to come in and take out those positions. So we think it's a pretty interesting place to play. And we think that those groups that are best positioned to play there are the ones that have historically had more diversified energy strategies. Well, along those lines of alternatives, we've seen some other funds start to rise up, such as aquaculture, for one. And then obviously, as I alluded to earlier, you've seen specializations start to take place in certain efforts, what KKR is doing in Asia. But can you just, from your view, tell us a little bit more about what asset classes are starting to gain popularity? Yeah, and I think a lot of this, John, goes back to my earlier comments in terms of being kind of a natural evolution of the infrastructure market and by extension, the capital raising markets and real assets. And that is, as the capital has increased, that's targeted toward more traditional infrastructure. There's been kind of an expansion of the definition of what infrastructure is. And, you know, 10 years ago, when there were not many players in the space, I think it was easier to find kind of plain vanilla infrastructure that could meet the returns that groups are targeting. Today, that's more difficult because it's become more competitive, especially on the larger end of the market. And so, you know, you see groups kind of transitioning into other subsectors that are infrastructure-like but may not meet a traditional definition of infrastructure. You know, Auker could be considered one of those in the sense that, you know, depending on the company, you can have high barriers to entry, you can have high CapEx requirements, you can have long-term off-take contracts. And so groups are starting to look for companies that are infrastructure-like but that may not meet a traditional definition of infrastructure. So I think that spurred some of the interest. The other, I think, is there's been a growth, and as I mentioned, the sector-specific funds, I think some of the thematic-based investing approach that groups have taken have allowed them to make sector bets in data and telecom, renewable infrastructure, traditional midstream energy infrastructure was sort of your single subsector dedication in the past. But the number of new entrants that's come into the space with specializations in data and telecom and renewable energy has really grown. And I think the other place that we're seeing more, as I mentioned on the small to mid-cap side, so we're seeing groups come in with a strategy targeted towards smaller assets with either a platform build-out strategy, a small asset aggregation strategy. They're looking to take advantage of the strength of the capital raising on the larger end by assembling positions that can easily be sold into that market. And then lastly, as you know, we're seeing more on the emerging market side. And I think, again, this is sort of a natural evolution of the return compression that we've seen in the larger end of the infrastructure space in more developed markets like North America and Western Europe. Groups are migrating toward more growth economies in order to meet, in order to try and target the returns that they want to target for those strategies. So those are kind of the areas that we see are newer that are starting to attract capital. And again, I think a lot of this is driven by a natural evolution in the growth of the infrastructure market. Before we get to emerging markets, we should note that in a deal that was announced only about 10 hours ago, KKR did announce that they had made an offer to acquire John Lange in concert with Epitext, which is another trend we've been following over the last two years, that you can mar investment with Greenfield Development as well, which we've seen constantly through deals like CDBQ acquiring Plenary and today's deal with KKR and John Lange. So it's going to be interesting to see the growth of those businesses now under the deeper, well-pocketed owners. Yeah, I think that is interesting, John, and just just one comment on that, that this is another area where we think, you know, infrastructure investors are finding some arbitrage opportunities in terms of what stabilized assets sell for versus what they can develop or build new assets for. And so, you know, if you think about stabilized renewables in North America, for example, that's a very competitive space. Once they once they are contracted under long term PPAs with utilities, the cost of capital that comes into those is very low. But there's still an opportunity to develop and construct renewable assets in North America at a yield that represents a pretty significant spread to where those stabilized assets trade. So, you know, similar to the deals you've mentioned, we've seen more interest in companies that have some stabilized operating portfolio, but also have a big backlog of construction ready development opportunities because that's how groups can drive incremental returns in competitive sectors. Switching gears over to emerging markets, Jonathan Kermode has had extensive experience over the last couple of years covering the fund formation in Mexico, Colombia, to name a few. Yeah, thanks, JB. Hi, Brent. You know, we've been curious about the kinds of investors that have started to look more and more at Latin America. Macquarie, for example, had a Mexican fund for a long time. It was their first Latin American vehicle actually raised inside of Mexico from local pension funds. We have seen other investors like Aberdeen raising Andean specific funds, regional specific funds. How do you see the appetite for emerging market risk, not just in Latin America, but in places like Africa and Asia as well? Yeah, I think that the appetite is there. I think it's growing off of a relatively small base, and that's really driven by the return compression, I think, that we've seen in developed markets. And at the same time, as you well know, there's a balance between trying to achieve incrementally higher return and trying to quantify the risk that you take in those developing markets. And Latin America is a good example of that. There have been groups that have historically been active in Latin America. Some of those that you mentioned, Brookfield's done a number of things in Latin America, GIP as well. There are certain constructs of the power markets there that are actually, from a regulatory perspective, in some ways better than what you find in developed markets. And that's one of the sectors on the power side that we've seen groups commit capital to in Latin America. That said, there has been a lot of geopolitical risk and changes in some of those Latin American countries. Most recently, in Mexico, you've seen a kind of a retrade on some of the power contracts there, trying to make some of the renewable generation bear its cost of the inefficiencies that it creates for the grid operators. That has sort of funneled down to traditional generation as well in the Mexican market. So what you know, you have to go into these markets understanding that that that regulatory construct can change at any time. Chile has historically been a very, I think, comfortable market for institutional investors to transact. I wouldn't call it developing by any means. It's an OECD country, but even a country as stable as Chile, we're watching now intently to see how this new constitution may come out and how that may impact private asset owners in what has historically been the most stable jurisdiction for foreign investment in Latin America. So I think it is on the radar, for instance, that we know that in developing countries, especially the need for infrastructure spend and the need for infrastructure assets is much greater. The competition is lower. There's the prospect for better returns in those markets without taking incrementally higher credit risk. But there is some geopolitical risk that investors have to be aware of. And so although I think it's growing in interest, I think it's still going to remain, you know, call it a kind of 10 to 15 percentage target. For investors relative to North America and Western Europe, which are going to be, you know, 60 and 40 percent respectively of their target infrastructure allocations. That's a very interesting point. And when it comes to the political risk, which obviously is relatively inherent in places like Latin America, how do you at Hamilton Lane assess that risk? What kind of techniques and what kind of resources do you have for for gauging that beyond just the press or ratings agencies? Yeah, we have we have local market expertise in those markets. Hamilton Lane is a global firm. We have presence, obviously, in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia. So it's very helpful to have local market resources that can help us to assess those risks. And I think, you know, to to your point on some of these groups that have been active down there, having having a track record and local market presence in those in those Latin American economies or Asian economies or African economies is really important. I think it's it would be very difficult for us and for most, I think, institutional investors to invest with a group that is just looking to kind of parachute into those markets and figure them out. So when we invest selectively in those developing markets, we do it with with the benefit of having a local presence ourselves or investing through a partner that has a team on the ground in those markets that has a long history of operating. I think the other way you kind of mitigate that risk is your contract counterparties really matter. So your ability to secure contracts that are U.S. dollar denominated and mitigate some of your currency risk, the pass through of those contract structures to holding companies that have a A-rated credit or above is a way to mitigate some of that geopolitical risk. So I think there's ways to mitigate that through both local partnerships, but also the way you structure the agreements for assets in those markets and trying to mitigate both some of the currency risk, but also the counterparty risk. That's a very interesting point, especially regarding the real assets themselves. When you discuss kind of fund of funds strategies, is there much appetite among those kind of investors to actually invest in Latin American based vehicles or vehicles based out of Asia or Africa? It might be kind of GPs operating from the region directly. How do you view those kind of investors, those local investors, compared to, say, a Black Rock or a Brookfield? Yeah, I think those those locally based investors have, you know, have have an advantage in a lot of ways over some of the groups that may be, you know, may be more global, but not as experienced in the in the emerging economies. So we have seen institutional appetite for country specific strategies or region specific strategies in Latin America, in Asia, to a lesser extent in Africa. But there is there is some interest there. But but again, I when I say there's some interest, I would say your typical institutional portfolio may have, you know, up to a 10 percent allocation for that type of market exposure. It's not zero, but they're they're sort of mitigating that through portfolio construction as well. But the local the local funds in those markets, they've typically been much smaller, obviously, than the globally diversified funds. But they have, on the whole, been successful at hitting their fundraising targets. And they but but they're typically raising, you know, 500 million dollar funds, not, you know, multiple billion dollar funds when they're specific to those markets. OK, fantastic. Brent, let's focus on these mega fund managers for a minute. So as you talked about earlier, you know, they when you raise a lot of money, the amount of opportunities you look at in terms of dollar sizes, it gets rarer, there's there's less opportunities that you can measure with the size of the equity check that you need to write at that level versus the type of returns you're trying to achieve. And not only that, you know, achieve that's consistent with historical returns, which is what got you to these, you know, supersized funds in the first place. You know, what's your view on capital deployment today through these larger funds? And, you know, are there enough opportunities out there for them to achieve these returns consistent with earlier generations of funds? Yeah, I think I think return compression is is kind of a natural occurrence when you get more capital coming into a sector. That said, historically, those funds have have have returned, you know, private equity like returns. And so I think going forward. What we should expect from those funds are more infrastructure like returns, which, you know, on a net to LP basis for for kind of a core plus to value add approach, we think is more in the kind of 10 to 12 percent range. Right. And so that return compression, it doesn't it doesn't mean that they can't achieve what they're advertising to us. It means that they may not achieve what they have historically. But historically, if you look at some of those at some of those mega funds in their in their earlier vintages, they've really returned private equity like returns. And so we think that, you know, sort of moderates to a more infrastructure like return, which is which is more consistent with the risk profile that they're on. You know, the funny thing is, too, for those mega for those mega funds, and we have relationships with all of them, we rarely see them run into each other on transactions. I won't say it never happens. It does on occasion. But they have been, for the most part, successful when pursuing opportunities independent of each other. And so we haven't seen a lot of overlap in their portfolios for some of the for some of the widely marketed larger deals. We have seen them multiple players in that space be a part of the same auction. But I would say that's been you know, that's been the exception. And so for the most part, we have seen them successful in continuing to execute their strategies. They've done that without bumping into each other a lot. I think they've they've focused more on some of the large asset corporate carve outs that are really not accessible to some of the smaller groups. And I think they've also been successful at, as I mentioned, expanding the definition of what infrastructure is away from kind of the plain vanilla assets and looking more toward other subsectors that behave in an infrastructure like manner, but may not fit your typical your traditional definition of infrastructure. Great. Let's talk about secondary vehicles. You know, again, getting back to our point about alternative asset classes become very popular as of late. What have you observed about what kind of assets are finding a home in these funds and why? And I'd like to get sort of your perspective on how to return stack up in secondary funds as opposed to primary funds. And again, this is to be very specific about infrastructure. We know that there's been secondary funds that are years old on the private equity side. So just wanted to get your take on things. Yeah, I think on a total return basis for a performing primary and a performing secondary, the expectation should be that the secondary fund should perform better. And the reason for that is because the value proposition of a secondary fund is to get you closer to where the monetization events happen. And so if you have similar asset performance, but you're coming into it from a secondary perspective, closer to when that asset's going to be monetized, you should have a higher IRR. And even if you're not transacting at a discount, just by virtue of being closer to the cash flow return, you should expect to have a higher IRR in a secondary vehicle. You know, that said, within infrastructure, the traditional LP secondary market in infrastructure is still reasonably thin, especially relative to private equity. This remains, even though it's grown exponentially in institutional portfolios and the number of players has increased on a kind of number of positions and scale of the capital opportunity and infrastructure secondaries relative to private equity, it's still a much, much smaller market. I have a feeling you're going to tell me next it's far more popular in Europe right now. Am I correct in saying that? No, no, I mean, I would say it's more popular in the sense that many of the, I shouldn't say many because there's not that many, but most of the larger infrastructure secondary players are have been European based so that they can and predominantly have European LPs. So you could say that that market is a little bit deeper in North America or in Europe versus North America, but they're still chasing the same secondary LP interests that some of the North America based funds are chasing as well. The one area, John, that we've seen growing a lot on the infrastructure secondary side has been in the single asset recapitalizations, the GP rollover vehicles, the continuation vehicles. And this makes sense when you have an asset that the GPs maybe owned it for four or five years. There's been some value creation over that time period. There's been some stabilization and de-risking of the asset base, but there's still runway left on the business plan for value creation. There's there has been a good liquid market for rollover transactions or GP led syndications of those single assets as they've as they've progressed through their life cycle. But that's probably been the fastest growing area of the infrastructure secondary market. Great. On that note, Brent, Jonathan, thanks for joining me on today's program. Really appreciate it. Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for listeners. And we hope you'll tune in next time. Workout.

Today, we discuss the surging trend of P3 broadband projects in the US, which has started to surface in highway projects after some earlier setbacks and have increased amongst rural counties on the heels of the Biden administration pushing broadband incentives through the America's Jobs Plan. Joining me in today's discussion is Devin Campbell, Assistant Vice President for Plenary Americas, Andrew Pettersen, Associate Consultant with WSP and Information Analyst, Olivia McFadden. Thanks for joining us on the podcast today, guys and gals. Before we get into a broader discussion, Olivia, can you perhaps outline what P3 deals are currently in the market for broadband across the US? Hi, JB. Thank you for the introduction and welcome Devin and Andrew to the podcast. This trend toward P3 broadband has indeed been a significant part of the US infrarmarket in the past couple of years and I'm excited to provide a quick overview from the data we currently have on our database. So for the past two years, we have out of a total of 25 P3 broadband projects and so these are fixed telecommunications in the fixed line subsector and this is across 17 states. Out of these 25 projects, we have approximately half of them that are either rural or highway initiatives and three of these projects were cancelled and one was placed on hold and eight of them remain in pre-launch, however, we still see that there is a lot of initiative even if these projects have not materialized the same as other P3s in the US. Arizona and California have had the most initiatives, although two of the three cancelled projects were from California. Arizona has two projects at pre-launch and one, the Gilbert Fiber Optic Project, had RFPs returned from Cox Communications and Sci-Fi Networks last September. One rural procurement in Vermont, the Trailblazer Broadband P3, reached financial close in September 2019 and five other rural procurements are on the horizon in Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska, Vermont and Virginia. Five highway-broadway projects are in pre-launch in Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Tennessee. The Georgia Interstate Broadway development was cancelled in March 2019 with the initiative reinstated in October 2020. The North Carolina Department of Transportation Highway Broadband Procurement is set to close soon, it's close to reaching financial close. Two other projects that have preferred proponents but have not yet reached financial close are the $40 million West Des Moines Fiber to the Home Network P3, which was awarded to Google last July, and the California State Park Wi-Fi and Broadband Project, which was awarded to Access Parks last month. The Englewood, California Broadband P3 received RFP responses from CoFi, Indio Networks, Mox Communications, Ting Incorporated and American Dark Fiber in October 2020. The two projects that were cancelled in California were expected to cost up to $2 billion each. And the New York City Broadband Services Expansion, which launched earlier this year, has a price tag of $2.1 billion. And that's it for just a quick little overview, so I'll take it back to you, JB. Thanks Adelaide, I appreciate it. So Andrew, to kick it off, the Federal Highway Administration made a communication last week to state DOTs, which could have a significant impact on highway procurement. If you can just walk us through this. Thank you, John. Yes, last week, the White House and DOT announced a memo from FHWA to state DOTs regarding guidance for alternative uses of the highway right-of-way. The guidance included a variety of topics, including energy generation, electrical trends, emission and distribution, and also our core topic for today, broadband. They bundled these into what they're calling Clean Energy and Productivity Projects, or CEC projects. And in pursuit of these projects, the guidance specifically mentions public-private partnerships, as well as the need to minimize repeated excavations, otherwise known as dig ones. The guidance clarifies really two methods for accommodation of these right-of-way uses in the Code of Federal Regulations, either as an accommodation as a utility, or as an approval as an alternative use. And I'm going to go a little bit into the weeds here, and then I'll bring this back up. To be accommodated as a utility, USDA DOT is informing the states to update their utility accommodation policies to include language around energy generation and or broadband uses. It's provided some kind of standard language for that. And it's also encouraging states to use fees accrued through this utility use for transportation-related projects. There's a number of current restrictions that are prohibited by statute around commercial activity, for example, on interstate rest stops, that the administration itself can't change. It's going to have to be changed in legislation. But what they can do, they are doing right now through administration priorities. The second approval process as an alternative use to the right-of-way, or as an alternative use to the right-of-way can be utilized if it's determined that these clean energy communications projects are in the public interest. In this administration, what the memorandum is saying is that FHWA will treat these types of broadband installations as an acceptable use as it assists with equitable communications access. So what does this mean? It just means that there's really clear federal support for more broadband projects along the highway right-of-way, as well as an explicit mention of P3s. So I'd hope that nationally we'd see kind of a strong growing market for these types of projects as states kind of take up the mantle of this federal guidance in particular over the next four to eight years. Great. Well, Devin, the good news is that Plenary is already here. In the past 12 months or so, they've won contracts for aspects of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Broadband Project and the recently awarded North Carolina Highway Broadband Project. Perhaps you can walk us through the contracts, one in each deal, as they were slightly less traditional, you know, DBFOM contracts, if you will. Thanks, John. Yeah, no, we've been pretty fortunate to have been focusing on these broadband right-of-way projects for the last few years. You know, starting with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's broadband project, you know, there was an initial procurement of that project that was, you know, a full DBFOM type of project with commercialization across the entire state. And I think, you know, once bids came in on that project and, you know, some more certainty around the costs, the Pennsylvania Turnpike subsequently, you know, canceled the initial procurement and ran a bifurcated process. So there's a, you know, design-build project for the eastern portion of the network by others and a consortium with Plenary and our partners Tilson won the operations, maintenance and commercialization scope. So about towards the end of this year, the project should be nearing completion on construction under the DB contract and we'll take over the network once ready for service and, you know, maintain a portion of that network for the Pennsylvania Turnpike and really that to meet their telecommunications needs and cashless tolling and there'll be additional capacity that, you know, our consortium will commercialize. So that closed earlier this year. We're obviously still early stages from a commercialization standpoint. You know, construction is underway, but, you know, definitely a positive development getting this type of model out there. Happy to dive into more details, but just switching gears on to North Carolina, you know, then with the caveat that we're still in a closing process there. So, you know, probably thinner on details that I could give, but effectively it's a similar model. There is a separate design build contract that will see the construction of, you know, roughly 600 miles of fiber optic cable along the right of way. And that, again, will be bifurcated between, you know, fiber infrastructure needed by NCDOT for their needs and their ITS devices and dynamic messaging signs and additional capacity that, again, a plenary consortium with Tilson will operate and commercialize over the next 30 years. So further away from a ready for service network there, but definitely a lot of activity, particularly on the commercialization side, you know, even before the network's in the ground to, you know, make sure we've got the right capacity and supporting infrastructure to, you know, to set up a viable and commercially valuable network. Devin, before we get to the next question, I think it would be good for our listeners to talk about the commercialization aspect of the project. How that works is, again, sort of an issue we don't typically deal with all the time in covering these procurements. You know, let me see the advice of the Penn Turnpike, can you walk us through how that's going to work? Sure. And, you know, I'll start by saying, you know, from my perspective, there's certainly different ways you can approach commercialization, and it really depends on, you know, who is the entity commercializing. So I think someone like Plenary Americas, you know, we are first and foremost, you know, an investor and developer of publicly owned infrastructure. So we're not a retail service provider. We don't provide, you know, end services for customers. That being said, I think there's a, you know, a really good framework here where we can effectively, and along with our partners at Tilson and SQF, we commercialize fiber capacity really on a wholesale type basis. So the types of customers we're looking at, you know, would range from mobile carriers to ISPs to data centers, you know, enterprises that are looking to, you know, have perhaps their own IT departments and are really just looking for dark fiber. So there's definitely, you know, a wholesale type of nature to the commercialization activities. Now that being said, we have the long term contract with the Turnpike and access to the right of way, which I know we'll talk about in a little bit, but, you know, that allows us to develop supporting infrastructure to make sure that those end customers are, you know, seeing some utility in both the location and the capacity and the function of the network that we'll commercialize. So that's really how we're looking at it. I think as many know in the industry, it moves very rapidly. So, you know, depending on what the needs are at the time for customers, you know, we'll likely need to pivot strategies ongoing as more of a business as opposed to, you know, kind of a fixed P3 concession. So that's generally how we're looking at the asset class. Very interesting. So we talked before airing today about right of way issues and, you know, sort of fill me in. Obviously, this is something that falls to the contractor ultimately, but can you just maybe walk us through the basics of what right of way issues will come up as these projects progress? Sure. Yeah, I can definitely give you my best answer. You know, I think notwithstanding, Cleanery won't be managing the construction of these projects. You know, we'll certainly be operating infrastructure and in the right of way and the nature of these assets. It's not, again, it's not a statement asset that sits there in the ground. There's going to be network expansion and upgrading. So there will be quite a bit of activity for us in the right of way. And I think the starting point for projects like Penn Turnpike and the NCDOT project is a great framework in that as part of our contract and concession agreement, we have this access to the right of way to be able to kind of operate and commercialize the infrastructure. And that's a big, a really important piece because not every fiber P3 type project has had that framework. And that kind of right of way access is a big risk. One that doesn't exist in the same way on these projects. That being said, you know, we're adjacent to an active roadway for hundreds of miles and there's obviously clear safety considerations, both in terms of activities on the side of the highway, as well as, you know, certain types of infrastructure that we'd look to build to support the commercial network must consider, you know, the risks and considerations obviously of being along the highway. So I, you know, I think we're certainly eyes open that there will be issues and constraints that come up. You know, there's obviously lots of other contractors over the next 20, 30 years that are going to be operating along the right of way, you know, road widening projects, there's existing utilities, there's, you know, requirements on our side to make sure we've got power for certain types of assets. So there's definitely going to be, you know, a lot of activity and a lot of management about that type of a project. But again, going back to the, you know, the foundation in these P3 agreements where we do have that access to the right of way, that's certainly important and manages a large risk on, you know, these types of projects. Great. Well, let's talk about the projects themselves. I mean, what do you think are the real catalysts for these type of projects from either the Turnpike authorities or the various state DOTs? Now you've, you know, been through more than a couple of years talking with Pennsylvania through the broadband project and more recently through North Carolina. What do you fear are the ultimate drivers for these type of projects and how does this really benefit the end user, aka the commuter at the end of the day? Yeah, that's a good question. I think, you know, really my strong view on, you know, the catalyst and really the success factor here is there needs to be a clear and understood, you know, value add for the public sector. So taking the Pennsylvania Turnpike, for example, you know, they have their own telecommunications needs for their highway operating activities. And so there's value for them. They need and they've decided to have a fiber optic supporting infrastructure for these types of activities. So they're already planning to install this type of infrastructure. The marginal cost of running additional capacity to commercialize and to generate income from makes a lot of sense. But without that kind of core, you know, highway operations need, core public sector need, it becomes a more difficult business case, right? Because there needs to be some willingness to really share in some of the costs, which has been done on both these projects where there is either state or other public funding coming in. You know, how that accrues to the actual, you know, users of the Turnpike itself in that example, I think it's twofold. One, the goal of this project is to also generate positive revenue for the Turnpike Authority. Which they can obviously use as part of their highway operations and maintenance and upgrading, which is obviously beneficial. And then the other side of the equation, which is probably a little, not probably, it's definitely less defined today, is how connected and autonomous vehicles are going to need telecommunications assets to function appropriately. And I think there's, you know, debate about which path it's going to go down and you really need a critical mass to really understand the best solution. But I think there's obviously in the next, you know, some would say five years, but definitely in the next 30 years, there's going to need to be infrastructure to support those types of activities. And I think that will be more of the direct benefit for users in addition to, you know, for example, having strong wireless connectivity in sections of the roadway where historically there just hasn't been good cell signals, things like that. You know, that'll be kind of the secondary and tertiary benefits of these. But I think the core focus on why these projects and how these projects can be successful is really identifying and valuing the benefit to, you know, the public counterparty. That's terrific. And Devin, only strong opinions on this program, by the way. We don't want weak ones, just to let you know. So just to conclude on the highway part, what other jurisdictions, to your knowledge, are looking at these projects now and, you know, what else can you say about them, the status of those projects? Yeah. So, obviously, Olivia covered some of this in the beginning. I think thinking about kind of pure DOT led types of projects, obviously one that jumps out and is probably front of mind is GDOT and Georgia's plan. Obviously part of a, you know, there's some history there and part of a bigger project, including construction of roadway construction as well, that will obviously have some interface to how the broadband project will unfold. But it's definitely one where we're looking at and keen to follow the development there. So I would say that jumps out, you know, there's, as Olivia mentioned, I believe, you know, the project in Tennessee that's in pre-launch and a few others around the state. But, you know, I definitely think there's also a lot of focus on these fiber to the home projects, which I know you're going to be talking about in a little bit. And, you know, there's obviously has a much more direct interface with underserved and unconnected individual customers as opposed to, you know, a broader kind of DOT need. So you're definitely seeing a lot more news in that sector, but, you know, keen to see more DOTs, particularly with the FHWA, you know, announcement that Andrew spoke a little bit about, you know, hopefully that acts as a catalyst to get more of these DOTs to think about broadband projects in a similar way. Yeah, I'm kind of looking at, I'm sort of wondering about the Austin, Texas, whether that's going to be a hub of activity there as well after they got their big infrastructure measure passed in November. And they are in the midst of doing several highway projects, whether broadband gets introduced there at some point or not. But I guess we'll see. So, Andrew, given your work with the Biden administration and the Senate Committee for Environment and Public Works, can you give us a sense on whether or not through the vise of America's jobs plan, what we should expect ultimately coming out of this, whether it's a broader infrastructure plan or at least getting some kind of broadband incentives package getting improved at some point? If not part of the broader sweep that was first proposed in March 31st. Thanks, Sean. Yeah, I, you know, at a high level have really kind of strong hopes for a broadband package to come from Congress in the coming years, in part because, you know, you've mentioned the, you know, America's jobs plan, but there's really been kind of clear messaging around the importance of broadband in particular going back, you know, through last year, both in, you know, now President Biden's campaign, as well as perhaps more notably, H.R. 2, the Moving America Forward Act that passed out of the House last summer. You know, that bill had a handful of provisions focused on broadband that came from the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House, you know, most notably preempting state restrictions on municipal broadband, which I think we'll talk a little bit about later. You know, and, you know, for the P3 conversation, a new financing program, BIFIA, or the Broadband Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. For folks listening in who are in the P3 space, you could probably tell that's a complementary program to TIFIA and WIFIA, the Third Transition and Water, respectively. You know, it's also worth noting that, you know, these provisions were, you know, endorsed by now Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, who has plenty of political capital to make sure these provisions are included in the coming bill. You know, and that brings us to today of kind of what is, you know, what is coming now. You know, the House is going to work off that bill from last summer, off H.R. 2, for their reauthorization. And I imagine those provisions, you know, will be included again. And you know, the White House has, of course, announced their America's American Jobs Plan, which includes funding for broadband as well. Their Republican Council proposal also includes broadband funding, which makes me believe it's likely that's something that will get bipartisan support in the long run, you know, in kind of a broader infrastructure package. So, you know, I have high hopes, and I think, you know, broadband is being included in kind of the definition of infrastructure on both sides of the aisle right now. Thanks for that. And just within the proposal itself, from the 31st of March, how is rural broadband supposed to work within what was proposed in that plan? The Biden administration's plan announced, you know, a kind of aspirational 100 billion dollars in broadband funding that includes, you know, covering rural broadband, you know, and they're really trying to kind of reference back to the New Deal, which brought electricity to rural America for the first time, you know, and what they're, you know, how they're thinking about it, kind of prioritizing broadband networks, is they're really kind of looking at, you know, broadband networks owned or operated by local governments, nonprofits and cooperatives. And this kind of alludes to, you know, the policy that was in HR 2 earlier, around, you know, kind of, you know, state preemption issues. You know, there's some examples of this out there already, that wouldn't, you know, consider rural but kind of smaller city, you know, the most notable examples is like the Chattanooga, which has a municipally owned broadband network that claims the highest internet speeds in the Western Hemisphere. You know, the local ownership model that I think the administration is looking at, that is kind of modeled in Chattanooga, you know, both allows the municipality to, you know, charge and make revenue, but also, you know, allows them the flexibility, for example, to offer free broadband during the pandemic, you know, when low income students were now working from or, you know, working or studying from home. So, you know, I think they'd like to see more successes like Chattanooga across the country. You know, and notably, I'd say, you know, Chattanooga's network was built with ARA funds for the last economic downturn. And you know, I'd imagine they want to kind of be able to scale that success across the country. So, you know, from a policy standpoint, you know, I think the kind of this local preemption kind of issue will be a little less bipartisan. I think something like BIFIA, this kind of, you know, financing tool for broadband will, I think will likely go forward unscathed, but I guess we'll see. Great. Thanks for that. Devin, you also talked to me before about how Plenary was looking at fiber to the home place besides highway projects. How does that work within the purview of a P3? Yeah, thanks, John. So, you know, similar to what I was saying earlier on the podcast about, you know, identifying that public need and I'll make the distinction between, you know, public here being individual customers and underserved customers and those that need fiber to the home versus, you know, a public counterparty that would be championing the project. You know, I think, again, there's a space from our perspective for traditional P3 investors and developers to really come in there and provide a public stakeholder, whether it's a municipality or, you know, a larger region or, you know, health authority, a school authority, some sort of champion and also anchor tenant is the key distinction here for, you know, part of the fiber infrastructure that really reduces the overall cost of the project, right, for to enable that access to individual homes and bring fiber to the home if that's, you know, the technical solution in a given project. So, the way we're looking at it is, you know, let's say there's a city that, you know, wants to move forward with the fiber to the home project, identifying, okay, what is the right-of-way access that you have a city have control over that this fiber infrastructure could be built on? You know, what needs do you have in terms of connecting your institutions or other functions from the public sector's perspective and valuing that and really determining, okay, how much of a cost share for this kind of core infrastructure is warranted and really is appropriate and, you know, based on the result of that, then you can say, okay, let's bring the infrastructure on that basis and on that framework to a certain point and it might not be all the way to individual homes. It might be to cabinets and co-location facilities that are very close to, you know, underserved communities and then have an actual retail service provider and ISP meet at that location. You know, obviously that location and that last mile cost needs to be economically feasible for, you know, whoever that other party might be meeting us and ultimately serving the customer, but that's the point of identifying, okay, what is the core kind of public facing P3 project that can effectively help subsidize that last mile? And I think there's, it obviously takes a little bit of work and structuring, but I think it's an appropriate delineation because then you can get your traditional P3 investors and developers to really focus on the, whether it's backbone, middle mile, or, you know, even further other assets, focus on the certainty of delivery, the certainty of financing and or funding and operations and maintenance, and you're leaving a small piece to the retail service provider that then is the most appropriate party to actually, you know, provide retail services and meet the needs of individual customers. So we think that general framework is one that could work in a lot of instances, not all of them, and it certainly wouldn't preclude, you know, accessing additional federal subsidy funding for, that's already allocated or talked about being allocated for these types of fiber of the home projects. And Devin, you just told me there was a good model for this in France. How does that work? I'll give you my best summary. Strong summary. My strong summary of how I think that works, notwithstanding, you know, I'm not as across the details as I'd like to be, but really generally speaking, and I'll compare it to a kind of a model that we see up in Canada, which is, you know, you've got a, for example, universal broadband fund that has money allocated to, you know, projects that will help serve underserved areas and kind of solve this connectivity gap or the digital divide. So the model there is you get, you know, subsidy public funding that brings down the cost of the project to such a level that, you know, private service providers, you know, it makes economic sense for them to come in and build that and own that infrastructure and serve those customers. I think that what they're doing in France and what they have been doing in France for the last number of years, you know, with probably varying degrees of success is to say, okay, what are these areas where, you know, they call them white zones, I believe, where their customers, where there is a connectivity gap, and instead of just, you know, providing a subsidy so that, you know, a private operator or service provider is attracted to build in that area, they actually, the local authority in the area will own the network and the network infrastructure and really structure these like long-term P3 concessions where a concessionaire, you know, like a plenary or someone else would come in, look at the model, evaluate what the revenue and cash flow might look like over the next 30, 30 plus years, and bid on that to be the concessionaire of that network with the distinction that it's publicly owned, the network infrastructure is publicly owned. So, it's a slight nuance, but one, and certainly brings with it limitations whether you're, when you don't have private ownership of assets from a financing standpoint, but I think it's structured in such a way that it, you know, it grants things like access and exclusive rights to operate those networks and allows a little bit more certainty in terms of, you know, how you can value these things, obviously, under a competitive bidding environment. But I think the biggest benefit is it's really the public authority is effectively taking the reins here and saying, yes, we are willing to own this infrastructure and structure this as a kind of concession project to make sure and effectively mandate service to these regions. And again, I mean, there's probably examples of where things haven't worked, you know, as the people would have liked them to theoretically, but I think that general model is one that, you know, we'd like to see a little bit more of, which is effectively public entities and whether they're state transportation agencies or, again, you know, municipalities or larger kind of regions where they see a benefit and are willing to invest in owning that, you know, whether it's fiber optic infrastructure or some other type of infrastructure, you know, fixed wireless or other, there's a willingness to kind of own and that infrastructure outright to make sure that constituents are being served. So one that we hope to see a little bit more of in North America. Appreciate that. So before we sign off, just wanted to thank the Young Professionals of Infrastructure, YPI, for bringing this podcast together. Andrew, if you want to say a few words about YPI and their functionality, that'd be great. Yeah, I'm happy to. So, you know, YPI is an industry-focused nonprofit founded in 2015 by young professionals in the US infrastructure space. Really focused on a handful of things, including, you know, promoting awareness, understanding of P3s, you know, driving, you know, increased diversity and inclusion within the industry, as well as, you know, increasing knowledge transfer and, you know, cultivating relationships amongst young professionals in the sector. We operate a number of committees. I, you know, in particular am on the education committee, and we're always looking for more folks to be involved in the organization. You know, if you have any questions, you know, feel free to reach out, you know, via our website at ypinfrastructure.com, and, you know, look forward to hearing from you all. Great. Thanks for that. And again, I thank my panelists for joining me today on the pod, and please tune in next time. Brook out.

I'm Jonathan Carmody, Latin American editor here in New York City, and I'm joined today by Eduardo de la Pena from Deloitte, Mexico. Hi Eduardo. Hi Jonathan. Good to have you. Eduardo is an expert in infrastructure and PPP concessions, been working for many years in the sector in Mexico and across Latin America. And today I'm going to talk to Eduardo about the state of infrastructure in Mexico as it stands and some of the opportunities that we're seeing there, as well as the prospects for Mexican companies to do business internationally as well, outside of the country. Eduardo, in your work in Mexico, as I said, you've seen many PPP contracts, many concessions. What's the state of the market like in Mexico at the moment for investors that are looking for opportunities in the infrastructure and energy spaces? I would love to say that the market in Mexico right now is more dynamic, but the truth is that we are still lacking a lot of projects and planifications. The current government has focused a lot on megaprojects, right? They are boosting, for example, the Mayan train in the South, the Isthmus Corridor, the Refinería de Dos Bocas, and the new airport, right? So they have this strategy to focus only on those megaprojects. This has been a problem to the infrastructure industry in Mexico because the majority of the companies in this industry, they attack smaller or medium-sized projects, right? So what is going on right now in Mexico is that, of course, we have those megaprojects that I believe are really interesting, especially the Mayan train. It has the opportunity to transform the region of southern Mexico. But we need more than that, right? There was an announcement, I know that most of you should know, a couple of months ago about a private investment plan for infrastructure. And I always say this, and I'm saying it in a really constructive way, that it's not a plan, right? It's more like a list of projects, more than a plan, and we can elaborate a little bit more on that. So right now, what is going on in Mexico is that we need more projects. The industry is really low. But on the other hand, you have a lot of capabilities in companies, right? You got a lot of construction companies, you got engineering companies, consulting services. You got a really robust industry around infrastructure that right now is desperate to look for opportunities. And the other situation in Mexico is that due to the political arrangement that we have, as you should know, we have federal states. So we have some states that they have, I mean, their own budget and they can promote their own projects. But you got like smaller states that they cannot promote infrastructure investment without the support or the budget from the federal government. So we are seeing also some movement in some states like Guanajuato. Guanajuato has been historically a really nice state to attract investment. Nuevo León could be another interesting one. However, right now they're going to be in the middle of political change, right? So the current scenario is that we need more projects. We have only mega projects and the industry is getting a little bit nervous about what is going to happen in the next years. And in terms of the plan, as you said, I think when I saw the infrastructure investment plan from AMLO that was announced last October, and then the second installment of that plan, which came out around November, you know, he was talking about many billions of dollars worth of investment, I think around 300 billion pesos in the original investment plan in October for around 39 projects. But as you said, some of those projects really had already been awarded to companies. Some of those projects were perhaps not necessarily the kind of PPPs or concessions that we've been expecting or hoping for perhaps in the infrastructure community. With that in mind, do you think that there are more projects to come from the federal government or do you think this is really a list of what they've got and what they're prepared to tender in the coming years? I'm an optimistic by nature, right? And I'm working with the government in some projects such as the Mayan Train. So I believe that there will be more projects to come. But one point that I wanted to make about that, the plan or the list that you mentioned is that, of course, when you look at the numbers, you say, well, there are like, I don't know, more than 100 projects, several million dollars in investment. But we need to remind two things. One is that the size of Mexico, of the economy of Mexico, more or less, we should be spending around 5 percent of our GDP on infrastructure just to sustain a healthy growth. But historically, that percentage has never been more than 3 percent. Peña Nieto wanted to take it to 4 percent. So the number as a whole may sound relevant, and I'm not saying it's not, but if you compare it as a percentage of the GDP and the target to be around 5 percent, there is a huge gap to cover. Right. And the other point that you need to analyze, and I have said this to a lot of colleagues, is like, you need to look into detail how many of those projects are ready to be built in, I would say, one year or two years. Some of them are, but some others are just in an initial state of analysis, right? And every project will take at least one year or a year and a half or two just to make the feasibility analysis. Then you have to do the engineering, the tender process, and then you have to start the construction, right? That's the second level of analysis that you should do. In my personal opinion, the infrastructure is a path for economic recovery, right? So we are coming out from a, well, we're still crossing a COVID crisis, right? But in order to recover faster, we need to invest in infrastructure. It is proven that for every peso, dollar, or whatever that you invest in infrastructure, in the medium term, you are going to have at least four times that in investment returns, right? So what I think could happen, and I'm hoping for that scenario, is that if the current government is going to realize that they need to boost economic growth, they are going to realize that the federal budget is not enough to make all of the projects by themselves or by public works, right? You need to attract the private sector, the investment of the private sector. And of course, there is going to be a political aspect to it. So they will need to prove that they are investing, that they are doing projects, that they are generating jobs. So I expect with all of these elements, in the next six months or one year, there are going to be some new projects launched by the federal government, especially around the mega projects could be like the ISMA region, but also there has been a lot of ongoing conversations with several stakeholders from CFE to try to reboost or to launch again, for example, the transmission lines, that will be a huge investment. And also they want to promote renewable energies, right? And this is kind of surprising because when you compare that initiative with the current political agenda and the reformations to the law, it may sound that it doesn't make any logic, but the logic behind it is that CFE may not be against renewable energies as far or as long as they have a relevant part of it. And you can take the example of the Central de Abastos, a project that is going to be launched in Mexico City, which is going to be one of the largest solar parks in an urban area. It's going to be around 40 or 50 megawatts. And the CFE is leading a great part of that initiative, right? OK, so we could see more promotion of renewable energy through the CFE and through their contracting mechanisms. You know, that's been a really controversial topic in Mexico for a long time, the generation market, especially with a lot of the auctions that happened. They awarded a lot of long-term contracts with the CFE and a lot of the other renewable certificates that they awarded at the time as well. A lot of those projects and the owners of the projects in particular got very worried by some of the movements that the Mexican government made to try and change the rules. Do you think that Mexico, now that we've had two, almost three years of AMLO's governance, do you think Mexico is showing signs that it's going to find a balance at some point? Or are there still more challenges that the government seeks to make towards private investors in infrastructure and especially energy projects? It's a complicated question, right? Because on one hand, what has been proof in these two years is that once the federal government makes a decision, it's really hard to make a turn back, right? We can start with the cancellation of the airport, right? There was a lot of pressure. There was a lot of conversations with private companies for the cancellation. And at the end, they took the decision to cancel it and to take the hit, right? They were going to pay the investors, but we are not building the project. So within the energy sector, maybe what we can expect is something similar, right? That the decisions that have been made or the changes that the Mexican government and CFE are pushing, they are going to remain that way. However, I believe they will get to a certain level of arrangement or commitment or negotiation with private companies to avoid litigation. The Mexican government, I believe they don't want litigation. They have a specific point of view on how things should work, and they are trying to work on that. And the other point is that I think there is some misunderstanding, and this is a dangerous space in which you start to mix the political reasons with the technical reasons, right? So the CFE and the Mexican government, they usually say that the renewable energies, for example, they produce a lot of intermittency, and there is not a secure way to provide electricity, right? Of course, intermittency, it's a problem, but there are organizational schemes and scenarios in which you can have a really balance between renewable energies and other sources of electricity, right? But just to say that because of due to the intermittency, we should not invest in renewables. I believe that is more like a misunderstanding, right? And the other thing is that maybe in my perception, what the Mexican government is questioning right now is how those contracts were granted and if they were on the best conditions for the state, right? So the previous government wanted to boost private investment, and this government wants to have a strong CFE. Those are like two antagonistic points of view, maybe in some spaces. But I believe we need to get to a middle point because the CFE cannot do the investments they need. They will, for sure, use the private sector, even if it's for concessions, for PPPs, even if it's for generation, or even if it's just for financing purposes, they cannot do all the investments they need by themselves, right? So I think this is just a phase, but I believe we should get to a middle point in which the CFE will get a little bit stronger as they want to, maybe take a more leading role in new projects, but the private sector will still be considered in those investments. Okay. And in terms of the construction companies, again, one of the topics that I wanted to discuss with you today was the possibility that Mexican companies will be forced to go abroad to try and find opportunities in other jurisdictions. In the past, we've seen companies like Marnos that have tried to do highway PPPs in places like Guatemala, south of Mexico, even further south going down to Colombia. We've seen people like here doing hospitals in Chile and showing interest in other countries in the region like Colombia as well. How have you seen the experience of Mexican companies doing business abroad in the past and what kind of prospects do you think there are for them to go and do business in other countries in Latin America today? I mean, I truly believe that we should, and the Mexican companies should go to other geographies in Latin America, of course. And I think we are, I may say that we are even late to it, right? Because you mentioned Marnos, of course, you mentioned here Ica had some experiences, but you can count them with the fingers of one hand. But the size of the company, so the infrastructure and engineering companies that we have in Mexico, it's really relevant. So I always make the comparison with the Spanish companies, right? So the Spanish companies took the decision 20 years, some of them 30 years ago to go outside from Spain to explore other geographies. And one of the most obvious one was Latin America, right? Because we share the language, I would even say that we share some cultural issues, of course. So they tried to do it and they succeed. They succeed and right now they are like some of the leading infrastructure companies in Latin America. They have projects across all over the continent. Yeah, but what is going on right now is that even the Spanish companies, they perceive that the political risk right now in Latin America, with a lot of governments probably going to the left side of the spectrum, they believe that maybe the risk is too much. The rates of return on the projects, because we have more competition, have been driven down. So the Spanish companies are looking for new geographies, right? Like Southeast Asia, Africa, and even the United States. United States has a really aggressive plan, as you know, for economic recovery based on infrastructure. And I have been having conversations with a lot of Spanish firms that they say, like, we need to go to the United States. So that space that the Spanish firms are going to leave on Latin America, I think they should be filled by Mexican companies. Well, you get Mexican companies, you get Colombian companies, but a little bit less in number, and even Peruvian companies. And another relevant player that has been really patient in the region and is starting to see some results are the Chinese companies, right? So I see a possible scenario in which some Mexican companies, I hope a lot of them, they will perceive that the market in Mexico is not as big as they need, and they should go and look for other opportunities in Latin America, right? The infrastructure industry right now is a global industry. We need to change the perspective of local construction. That, of course, is useful. But right now, if you want to play on the infrastructure scenario, you need to look for global opportunities or at least regional opportunities. And obviously, the best way to find those opportunities is by reading information and seeing our stories and using our database. But beyond that, how can Mexican companies really best approach doing business in a place like Colombia? Colombia has an enormous program of infrastructure opportunities coming up in the next few years. The fifth generation 5G program is projecting around $6 billion worth of investments in highways, airports, railways and waterways. For Mexican companies to go and do business there, Eduardo, what do they need to be considering? It can be very expensive to open a new office in a new company, hire local staff, get local advisors. What do you think is the best way that they can approach these markets and find a way in? Yeah, I mean, you know, I wouldn't especially agree that it is expensive to open a new office because, on the other hand, you need to compare what is more expensive, right? To try to open an office and explore opportunities or just to remain with that asset and capital in your geography without projects, right? So I think it's worth the shot. I think in infrastructure, as in any business, you got two things. You got the know-how, but sometimes the most important thing is the know-who, right? So, of course, you need to understand the regulation of the country. One good thing is that, at the end, the regulations in Colombia or in Ecuador or in Peru, they had certain similarities to the Mexican regulation. The PPP schemes are similar. Of course, they got their own local requirements, but it's not as going to China, you know, it's something really similar. So understanding the local framework is really important, the legal framework, sorry. The other important thing is to understand the country, right? What are the institutions that do the planning, that do the tenders? What has been said about foreign investment? You need to, of course, absorb all of the information that you can. And, of course, at some point, you need to deploy some resources. Some companies, the ones that you mentioned, for example, they started with assigning one person or maybe a couple of or a small team to do specific travels, to talk with government officials, to talk with foreign investment agencies like ProColombia, et cetera, to have conversations with local construction companies. And starting from that, then they decide to do the next step, right? We are in an industry that it lives by projects. So my recommendation will be to understand the pipeline, focus on the projects and the sectors in which the Mexican companies believe they have experience, that they are strong, that they have credentials that they can demonstrate. And the other aspect will be to look for local partners, right? This is something that I always say to the Chinese companies when they arrived in Mexico five, 10 years ago, they didn't even have Mexican professionals within their companies, right? And I understand that, of course, you need to have Chinese officials, but when they start to hire local people, they saw a change within their success rates. So general recommendations will be that understand the legal framework, understand the pipeline, focus on what you believe you're strong, look for local partners. And of course, and this is not a commercial, but look for local advisors also, right? In Deloitte, we currently help a lot of companies to explore new regions and opportunities. And of course, it's going to take time, but the size of the projects and the type of projects that are going on in South America or the Andean region, or even Central America, some of them are far more interesting than the ones happening in Mexico. So you got the knowledge, you just need to take the jump of faith, right? Sure. And I think it really plays in as well to what you were saying previously about how infrastructure is really going to be used by a lot of governments to help in the economic recovery in the post-COVID period. We've seen countries like Brazil that have been really plowing ahead, trying to do as many of their tenders as possible, trying not to deviate too much from their timelines. And, you know, in places like Colombia, as I said, with the 5G program, in Chile with their hospital program that they're tendering, there are a lot of opportunities around the continent. You mentioned as well, some of the political risk, obviously there's a very interesting election happening in Peru right now between Keiko Fujimori and Castillo. And I think those kinds of situations as well can really, you know, they can really leave a lot of doubt for investors, depending on who gets into power. But at the same time, as you said, infrastructure really is so important to the country and to economic development. Can you just talk a little bit of that philosophy that you have and how you see how infrastructure as a philosophy really serves the needs of the people in those senses? Yeah, I mean, and just let me give you a comment on Peru, because this is an interesting thought that I was having a conversation with a local friend in Peru and a lot of people or private companies are afraid of Castillo, right? But he told me, you know, Eduardo, remember Ollanta, Omala, he was from a left side party. And for example, and the economic growth that it has with Ollanta in Peru was a significant one, was one of the best growing growth periods for Peru, I believe. So once again, sometimes you have to differentiate the political aspect of it and the investment, right? So I will not be afraid even if Castillo wins, because at the end, you need to invest in infrastructure. And I'm going to link this comment to the philosophy that you mentioned. Why do you need to invest in infrastructure? Because it's one of the most, it is one of the investments, the public investment that has the highest rate of social returns, period. If the lack of services and the lack of infrastructure, it makes more damage to the lower income families and the states that need more investment than other ones. For example, if you have good roads, the local producers can take their production to the center of consumption because you can put your production in a truck and sell it. But if you don't have access to that transport infrastructure, you will need to sell it at a cheaper price to a local company that will put all of the small producers together. That's a small example. Another example, in energy, having reliable and cheap electricity, it helps on one hand to the families, of course, and I'm talking about, for example, energy poverty, that it's a concept that is well spread. There is a direct correlation between the use of electricity and the income of a family, because you can use it for storage your food to have a better performance, but also you can use it to some level of entrepreneurship. Now you can use it for studying, etc. So having good electricity helps that sector of the country. And also, of course, it boosts manufacturing companies and other industries that will attract a workers that usually will not be skilled workers. And also you can apply the same to water. Water, I believe it's a huge, how would I say, it's something really sad that is going on in Latin America because we don't invest in water as much as we need, because usually it's not that politically profitable because you cannot open a new pipeline, right? I mean, you cannot see it. So sometimes the political, sorry, the politician doesn't focus on that, but improving water condition has a direct impact on the health of the population. So I believe that the governments in Latin America, if they want to give priority to the poor citizens, as they say, they need to invest in good quality infrastructure and in good quality services because they will help them more than other sectors, right? That's just the social part. And of course, the financial part, you are going to generate new jobs during the construction, also during the operation. And as I mentioned to you, the return on the infrastructure investment would be around four times, right? So it makes sense to do this from a social perspective and from a financial perspective and from a competitiveness perspective. And just one final point, I think as well, the interesting question, when you get changes in government, people who come into power like AMLO or potentially Castillo, the question is how favourable they're going to be to the kind of investment structures and mechanisms that developers typically like, such as concessions or public-private partnerships. With that in mind, I think it's also interesting to consider the government finances. Can the government afford to effectively do this infrastructure themselves? Can they build a new airport or a pipeline or a port or whatever else they need, a water treatment plant? And how can the private sector best kind of relate the benefits of PPPs and concessions to governments that are perhaps reluctant to use those structures? I think that's a very important point to consider as well. Yeah, because, you know, there is this conception sometimes from some governments that they believe that since the infrastructure investment is such a millionaire, I mean, they are like huge investments. The only ones that are going to be benefiting from that are going to be the investors or construction companies. But they forgot the daily users, right? And I do believe, I mean, in the spirit of trying to be a little bit critic, that, of course, you can improve the PPP model and, of course, you can make it more social. And let me give you an idea, for example. If you're going to have a concession for roads, well, maybe you can do a different tariff for local users to pay less. We have been doing that, for example, with trains and metros or another example that has been going on in some countries in the Andean region with internet, right? You can give the concession of the spectrum for telecommunication companies, but in return, maybe you can ask them to provide free services for certain towns or certain citizens, right? So you can make a mix among these things. Fonatur is trying to incorporate this social aspect within the infrastructure they are building, right? For example, they are planning to deploy optic fiber across the Mayan train line and they want to allow certain capacity to provide free services. And this is a great idea because then you put the private sector to work for your interest, right? You align the incentives. You say, listen, I'm going to grant this project to the one company that provides me the more social return or they give me the best additional construction for local companies or give me more services for free, et cetera, right? So you can use the model to create a bigger social impact, but it's a matter of improvement, not a matter of saying, no, we're not going to invest in infrastructure and PPPs because it will only make the rich companies richer, right? Right, indeed. Eduardo, listen, those have been really interesting points you've made and it's been a really fantastic discussion. I think everybody's going to really enjoy this conversation and I'm really delighted that you agreed to come on the show. Thank you so much for appearing on Crossroads. No, thank you, Jonathan. And I hope with this podcast, a lot of companies in Mexico take the leap to the rest of the continent. Fingers crossed. We hope to see them in the 5G program and elsewhere in Latin America. So that's it from us today from everyone at Information Crossroads and New York and in Mexico City today. We appreciate your time and attention and we wish you all the best.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2021-04-19 16:00:15+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Vicinity Energy discusses university energy P3 deals\n**Episode ID:** 4342\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to another edition of Crossroads podcast. I'm Americas editor, John Burke, and joining me today is Brian Mueller, Chief Development Officer of Vicinity Energy, a Boston-based district energy business and portfolio company of Anton Infrastructure Partners. Brian, welcome to today's program. Thank you, John. Pleasure to be here. Vicinity is teamed with Anton and Bond Building Construction and is among five squads shortlisted for the University of Maryland's NextGen P3 project. An RFP is expected shortly. Separately, Vicinity struck a deal over the summer to acquire Morgantown Energy Associates, the district energy system serving the West Virginia University. Vicinity is among a few developers that are starting to make inroads into the university energy P3 space on the concept that it leaves designing modernized energy systems in the hands of an integrated consortium, while keeping the university in alignment with its cleantech goals and possibly using the project to create additional opportunities for student base, such as educational programs and endowments. In recent years, larger state schools, such as the Ohio State University and the University of Iowa, have successfully ran and closed procurements for new energy systems, while smaller private schools, such as Georgetown University and Howard University, have also closed bilateral deals in recent months. Brian joins us to walk us through some of the latest developments on this front and get a sense on what lessons are to be learned through some of these procurements. Brian, can you walk us through the process of getting the P3 procurement done through a university as opposed to a municipality? Sure, Jon. Public universities and municipalities obviously follow fairly formal procurement processes as required by the procurement codes in their respective states. The formal processes obviously are run by the consultants, you know, particularly on these larger transactions, they really require that expertise to run a fair, balanced process that allows a successful outcome. The primary difference between a university process and a municipality process really focuses on the universities looking at an ability to engage with consultants of a variety of types earlier and more often in the process, an ability to develop concepts that are beneficial and flexible and not prescriptive, and that they really also differ in one key area I feel is that with the universities, there's a real need to sell throughout the organization. It's through the finance department, through the operations department, the leadership of the university on campus, as well as at the various board levels, as well as engaging with the faculty and staff constituencies. It's really a opportunity to sell up and down the organization to meet various constituencies' goals and objectives, whereas in a municipality procurement, they're typically procured by smaller groups or committees, and they are left to deal with engaging more of the community folks. Great. As you stated earlier, there's been now sort of a track record of universities and colleges big and small going through various procurements. Energy is, of course, one of a couple categories now. Housing has also been a popular category, as well as other uses like parking and academia, as well as actually creating new infrastructure around university medical campuses. Have universities grown up in terms of being specific around what they're looking for in their next generation of energy systems, or do you feel in general it's still a more open process in terms of getting feedback from investors and developers for such a procurement? I absolutely believe that university leadership has evolved, particularly over the last decade. I do believe they are being specific, but they're being specific about their goals and objectives. They too are listening to their faculty, staff, students, board members, alumni on clear direction and a lot of different clear directions, but you can say that on where they need to be as the university. So I see them becoming much more receptive to flexible solutions from third-party providers, but really challenging those providers to leverage their expertise, their experience, to bring new ideas, new concepts. And then really I've seen an evolution of the universities moving to an outcomes-based program that had very measurable and achievable goals and expectations of the partners. And then they expect those partners to meet those expectations. To do that, they're obviously making very long-term commitments in a true partnership format that addresses operational, current capital requirements, as well as long-term capital improvements and asset recycling or asset monetization and replacement. So Brian, how are universities viewing costs at this given point, given that often universities have to tap corporate debt versus a lower cost municipal debt to fund these projects? That's a very good question and one that we hear often. And it's really the costs associated with the educational mission, the research, the development, the growth, and their respective investments in the core mission activities versus the cost of the infrastructure. What we're seeing is the use of the third party on non-core assets and infrastructure allows them to focus on their core activities, reinvest in their educational assets, their research assets, their housing assets, and allow a third party to accept the risk of the asset management of the non-core for the university into the third party's core business that allows them to shift that money to asset recycling and replacement, both for the short term and for the long-term replacement of deferred maintenance or capital renewal requirements. It's really a best use of both worlds in a lot of cases. This allows the university to use the proceeds to fund endowments and an active third party will engage with the university to enhance those endowments, enhance research funding and educational opportunities for the faculty and students on campus. Great. Brian, you were an engineering student yourself once, right? Long time ago? A very long time ago. Yes, I was. Yeah, I just think it seems like some of the schools have started programs around these new projects to be able to get in at the ground level to see a new renewable type of project getting built or something modern. It's probably a cool learning experience all in. It is. I enjoyed my time in engineering and particularly in graduate school when you engage with desktop programs that can evolve into commercialization or commercialized activities. Getting that hands-on feeling is important, I think, for engineers entering the workforce. But also from the third party's perspective is there are a lot of fundamental research activities that are going to be the next generation of technology and as good stewards of the projects and of the community and of the business, we should be looking to be at the forefront of those developments and accelerate those where we can. Interesting. So just moving on to another area, one of the university deals that got done in the last couple of years was at Syracuse, where there were a couple of starts and stops there, but ultimately they came to a deal with EnWave and the district energy system that was proposed was more around both the city and the university itself rather than just serving the needs of the Syracuse students. Is that something that we might see further in other deals as we think about towns and the schools that they house? And it's almost like there's smaller towns and there's bigger schools and somehow you would think you'd want more of a modernized energy product in communities like that. So I'm sort of wondering if we're going to see more of that going forward. Sure. It would definitely not surprise me. I think in the large cities, integrating district energy systems with the university's healthcare campuses as part of the district networks is common. Vicinity, as an example, serves many colleges, campuses, and the districts that we provide service. When we look at a university-owned system expanding into the surrounding city, it's often a question of really what is the right load conditions. So Syracuse has a number of healthcare facilities that are in the very close proximity to their system, as well as how are the engagements between the city and the university. Effective engagement at the town and gown strategy level is how do they integrate even areas of support around efficiency, optimization, where the university, if it's a university system, can leverage those opportunities with the nearby facilities, the nearby buildings, and grow. But I think it really takes a lot of engagement at both top levels to work together, to collaborate, because after all, these are infrastructure plays that support the entire community. And in some cities where the university is either the largest or one of the largest employers, it just makes natural sense to have the two groups integrate and share services. Great. So, Brian, what other universities do you think might be able to undergo a process this year? Or if not one, to go into specifics, maybe talk about your expectations of this being a trend for the rest of the year and on until 2022? Yeah. So without naming specific universities, I do think there will be more colleges and universities seeking third-party solutions to their sustainability, efficiency, and infrastructure upgrade programs. So I do think there will be a number of processes for both energy and other infrastructure assets in the university and particularly public university market. I do think that these projects, these processes allow long-term infrastructure challenges to be achieved through the effect of partnerships, the ability to provide asset management, asset recycling, the renewal, as well as reducing the risk of the utility services. I also do believe, and I've heard this from clients, is that as we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic, many colleges and universities obviously have had a tough financial time. They're looking to solve infrastructure issues as well as the need to address hybrid education models and how do they address the need to satisfy their educational goals and changing their educational infrastructure. So I do believe that there will be third-party infrastructure options to support sustainability, efficiency, and long-term risk transfer from an infrastructure play and an energy play, definitely 2021 and 2022 and beyond. Great. So just getting to purely district energy, where does that stand now just for cities and maybe talk about backgrowth going forward? Sure. I personally think it is an exciting time for the district energy businesses. It's an exciting time for vicinity and our clean energy future. It is an exciting time for district energy as a whole. The systems are very vital, reliable, and resilient components of a city's utility infrastructure. They provide a lot of opportunity to grow both with existing building stock as well as with new buildings. And what's really important to remember is that the infrastructure that is supported by the district energy plants and the district energy systems is irreplaceable. It's extremely robust. It has a long-term, long time, long-term history. It's got a viability and an ability to adapt to ever-changing customer needs as well as challenges from cities and states with respect to environmental and sustainability goals. Our ability to upgrade and make our plants more efficient through the use of biofuels or other technologies, our ability to improve the efficiency and optimization of our operating assets, the benefits are reaped not only by us but by the entire community that we do serve. So as we look to improve our sustainability, our carbon footprint, and we work towards net carbon zero, all of our customers, all of our partners in the communities that we serve are seeing those benefits. And we're able to do it on a large scale. Just one last question from my end. Can you talk about what new innovation there has been in district energy in the last year or so? From an innovation perspective, I think the districts have continued to evolve. We have been evolutionary in our systems as we have migrated to more efficient systems. We are constantly looking at new products and new technologies. One that is really exciting for us at Vicinity is that we will be using a biogenic fuel to replace our remaining backup fuel oil, which is a locally sourced product. It's a waste vegetable oil. It will be used locally and we'll be able to replace that fossil fuel. We're also engineering and evaluating a number of options around clean energy sources and technologies that will keep us out of the forefront of efficiency and sustainability. Great. Well, Ryan, that's all the time we have. Thank you for joining us today. It was a really interesting discussion. Thanks, John. And we hope Crossroads listeners got a lot out of it. And please tune in next time. Rick out.

Joining me today is Roddy Devlin, a partner in Nixon Peabody's Project Finance and Public Finance Group, to discuss the March 31st unveiling of the 2.55 trillion America's Jobs Plan and how it will impact infrastructure development as it relates to both projects and potential P3s. Welcome to the program today, Roddy. Thank you, Jon, and thank you for having me. So, the Act, which proposes to be funded by an increase in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% and implemented over an eight-year period, offers spending in several different categories related to transportation, clean energy, water, and broadband. Some of the newer categories include funding for electric vehicle charging and introducing storage as a beneficiary of an expanded investment tax credit, or better known as ITC, and amending Section 45Q tax credit, which addresses carbon capture. First off, Roddy, we have a very bold plan here. Every element of infrastructure and alternative energy is addressed that is going to be addressed, and I don't think President Biden got to every category in yesterday's speech to talk about it, but dating back to some past several traditions, why is this proposal different relative to other infrastructure plans that you've seen? Thank you, Jon. It certainly is different. I mean, it's not just its size. As you mentioned, it's a $2.55 trillion plan over eight years, which makes it the largest plan since World War II. So, it's seismic in its size and scope, and it truly is a once-in-a-generation plan. So, that makes it different. But the other thing that really marks it out against almost every other infrastructure plan we've seen for the last decades is that it's a very politically-driven program. And I'm not saying that in a bad way at all. President Biden has been quite plain that addressing racial disparities and racial justice issues is front and centre to his infrastructure plan. He's made it clear that he views infrastructure as being one of the means of perpetuating racial inequalities, and he's looking to reset that. And he's been quite direct in saying that the plan is going to focus potentially 40 per cent of its investments in low-income and poor communities of colour, recognising that poor public transportation has disproportionately impacted low-income communities over the years, as has poor school infrastructure, poor water infrastructure. It's a very broad plan. And it's not to say that other plans aren't political, but they're not as overtly political. Deciding to focus your investment plan on roads, bridges, tunnels, airports is in and of itself a political decision, as most past plans have. So, it's putting the politics front and centre, making that a driving force, is new and differently marked. This is a different type of plan. As you mentioned, your green energy and energy resilience and your climate issues are front and centre to this plan as well. As you mentioned as well, he's looking to move most of the federal fleet of vehicles to electric vehicles, which is a seismic change, given the amount of vehicles, trucks, vans, cars that the Feds have. You're moving those to fully electric. You will have a real significant impact on the electric vehicle market, including the need for charging stations across the nation. So, I think that's the two things that make it really different from other plans, the size and the recognition that the infrastructure has always been political and trying to use infrastructure to address this particular political agenda. Right now, your Marxist is a different type of plan. So, Radhi, the clean energy aspects of the bill really create clear incentives for development. This includes the investment tax credit and how it applies to areas like battery storage, potentially, as well as carbon capture. But when we get to the transportation elements, which a lot of P3 professionals probably are taking a look at, they're seeing about $620 billion spent for various portions of transportation, replacing old bridges and highways and electrification of transit, which was talked about by Biden yesterday. Can you walk us through the immediate effects of the bill from your purview and what the medium and long-term effects might be? Sure. You make an interesting point that even the allocations of your priorities of spending is pursuing his agenda in that there is a substantial amount of money set aside for traditional highways. I think it's a 35% increase over past funding levels, which seems like a lot. But proportionally, that's a C minus in the Biden plan in that there's a 400% increase in real transit investment. So there's definitely an emphasis on de-emphasizing traditional roads, bridges, tunnels in favour of public transportation, which is interesting. But to get back to your question directly, short-term versus long-term impacts. I mean, the good thing is there are lots of existing programs and mechanisms for getting federal money out the door quickly in the transit space. TIFIA being one of them, but there's many other mechanisms where that money can funnel through relatively quickly. If this plan does come to fruition, I could see the money coming to the states relatively quickly. And the states are starved for infrastructure investment. I mean, the needs are truly significant. President Biden identified your 10 major bridges across the nation which have been needing replacement improvements for decades. It's not as if this issue suddenly arisen during the Biden administration. The transactions are there, the needs are there. There has been historical underfunding of American infrastructure for decades, and there's a pent-up demand, a pent-up need for everything from improved school infrastructure, water, waste water, roads, bridges, tunnels, not even to mention the new areas of green energy and technological development that he's focusing on. So I wouldn't say that the projects are necessarily shovel-ready in the sense that the money will be going to work in two or three weeks, but there's a lot of projects out there that could do with this money very, very quickly. And I think if the Biden administration follows through, there's going to be a real impact very quickly. Yeah. I mean, at Information and Elsewhere, I mean, we're covering specific projects that are along the lines of procurement right now, and there's a little bit of state political heat, if you will, on projects such as the Pennsylvania Bridges Project where, again, that wasn't the 10 bridges President Biden was talking about, but I'm sure the motives are clear. These are older bridges that Pennsylvania is trying to get modern infrastructure in place on, and then you have the Louisiana program, which has always been there. They got Belle Chase done, and they want to get the CalSCO Pass Project done next, and Alabama is trying to improve their I-10 corridor as well, just to name a few that are out there. And now you also have Austin, Texas, with their measure that they passed at the elections to get a $7 billion infrastructure package across for lots of things. So there's certainly projects out there. No shortage of projects like you talked about. For sure. I threw LA Metro into that list as well. Sure. We've got a very adventurous plan that's been on the drawing board for a long, long while. And so there's depth in terms of, are the projects there? Absolutely. Will the states, municipalities, cities jump on this money? Absolutely. So in terms of short term, if the money really does start to flow, the projects are there that can lift it up quite in the short term. In the long term, if this plan comes to fruition, it truly has a prospect of being transformational. It's well known that underinvestment in American infrastructure has a real impact on the US's economic competitivity, and everything from sitting in traffic jams and underserved roads, to having airports which aren't conducive, to investment and compensating. The impact that poor infrastructure has on the American economy is myriad. And this program has the potential to address that. And in terms of the racial injustice, you know, to put that front and centre of the infrastructure plan is new. And as I say, when I say it's a political plan, it's not a criticism plan, because I think all infrastructure plans are political. This one is wearing its politics in its sleeve. So if, again, it manages to achieve what it's focusing on doing, including putting 40% into underserved communities, that again has the opportunity to be transformative in the long term. So yeah, it's an adventurous plan. And it's, you know, both in the short and long term, it's got lots of prospects of creating real change. Okay, well, let's talk about the mechanisms a little bit more. Do you think it was a mistake not to, again, this maybe more applies to the transportation aspects and the water aspects of it, to establish a permanent pool of capital, whether it be a federal infrastructure bank on par with the Canadian Infrastructure Bank and EIB, or perhaps sequestering a budget specifically for infrastructure? Was it a mistake to make it very clear in the bill, this is what they were trying to do or not? It's a very hard question. I mean, you're having a federal infrastructure bank with an established source of financing would be great. I mean, that would be a real shot in the arm for, you know, for long term stability when it came to infrastructure investing. But it's a bit of a chicken and an egg issue. I mean, if you're going to line everything up until you have a free system in place, that will kind of distract you from getting the projects out the door. And I think in making the agenda behind the infrastructure plan so apparent and so central, I think it's going to be easier in some ways to get broad support behind it. I mean, to be blunt, people in the infrastructure space such as myself, we find it interesting, we find it sexy, but infrastructure isn't necessarily the sexiest topic in the agenda. And, you know, the Biden administration is doing a lot to put it more centrally. You know, the fact that Mayor Pete is heading up the Department of Transportation and taking a central role in the infrastructure plan is important to me. And, you know, when you turn on late night television and you find, you know, Mayor Pete on there talking about infrastructure, that's new. That hasn't happened before. So it's a new focus and a new way of coming at infrastructure. So to circle back to your question, an infrastructure bank would have been great. To have more certain funding in place would have been great. And we'll probably talk about this, but the main source of financing for the plan is a material increase in taxation, which is going to be difficult to get through a divided Congress. I think to wait for an infrastructure bank to get that lined up in place would have slowed down the process and slowed down getting out the door. And getting out the door an infrastructure plan that has clear policy agendas that have very wide support, not just among Democrats, but among Republicans too, is going to hopefully build some momentum to get this thing moving, even with the lack of an infrastructure bank. And infrastructure banks, you know, things change too. I mean, there is a thought that if you have an infrastructure bank, then at least that provides some stability across administrations. And if there's a change in the executive, then at least you have that base there that kind of continues the funding. But your funding can be cut off too. The mere fact you have an infrastructure bank doesn't mean that it's always going to be there. The funding sources can be cut off and directed elsewhere. So I hope that will come in time. And, you know, from a chicken and egg perspective, once these projects start rolling out and once the money starts hitting the streets, if there's a recognition that a federal infrastructure bank would be a more efficient way of kind of funding this money through, then that could well come. And I'd certainly be supportive of that if that becomes part of the plan. Excellent. Thank you for that answer. So let's talk about some of the elements of the package itself. You know, I mentioned transportation before being only $600 billion of the package. And then it goes on to address, like I said before, clean energy, water infrastructure, which President Biden did point out yesterday. It's severely underinvested at this point. And then on to broadband and getting 100 percent of the country fully, you know, connected to the Internet, which sort of, you know, goes back to the Wi-Fi being another utility soon. I think that we're coming closer to that that day, given some of the language around that bill yesterday. But, you know, what was your sense of transportation relative to some of these other categories? I mean, how do you think about it? I mean, was it fair in the sense that it tried to address everything, could have been more focused on certain categories? What are your thoughts on that? You know, fair is a difficult concept. It's very much in the eye of the beholder. It was a it was a plan that throws the net wider when it comes to infrastructure than other plans. Other plans in the past have looked at infrastructure purely as being, you know, transportation, roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and, you know, sometimes ignored even your basic water, wastewater infrastructure. So this is a plan which focuses on infrastructure in a broader way. So your transportation is I think it's 40 percent of the overall overall plan. But you're focusing on affordable housing, low income housing, schools, universities. I mean, that's all perfectly valid. I mean, that's absolutely infrastructure. And if the purpose of infrastructure is to improve people's lives and to make sizable improvements in people's day to day, then you're better to start than the homes. I mean, again, there's been chronic underfunding of public housing, low income housing at the federal level for many years, and this plan is adventurous in addressing the needs of that sector, everything from energy retrofitting to reinvestment to get new affordable housing in the urban areas where it's needed. Your schools, again, have been chronically underfunded. And from a racial justice perspective, both of those focuses are again central to Belgium's desire to redress the racial imbalance that has been implicit in a lot of the federal investments over the years. So your fare is a difficult one, but it's an adventurous, aggressive plan. And maybe it pushes the boundaries a little of what's infrastructure. You're looking at your other policy considerations, your health care workers and home care workers and your child care. You come into that, come into the plan too in a way which is pushing carefully legitimate policy goals, but maybe pushing the infrastructure a little too far. But it's an adventurous plan and I don't think the underfunding of transportation, given the size of the investment, everything is getting more, including surface transportation with reduced numbers, everyone's getting more. Some areas are getting more and more, recognising that there has been traditional underfunding in those areas. Well, let's move over to the P3 aspect of it. I mean, obviously what we saw this in the first quarter was the advancement of some projects that were gestating for a while. To your point, Radhi, you mentioned LA and the Sepulveda transit project, which finally picked proponents to build rail from the San Fernando Valley to LAX in a deal that will not reach financial close for two years. It's not going to be shovel ready for a while as they pick what the method's best to get that project moving. And then on the East Coast, the Maryland Managed Lanes project. It has many names, so I apologise for our listeners who might object to what I'm saying, but you understand what I mean, in which we got to a proponent with Transurban and Macquarie Capital to build and manage lanes across multiple highways as the start of a much broader project. But those are the big mass civil projects. I mean, what's been going on in the past few years has been a lot of university projects, a couple social projects, that's what I meant, and some other smaller projects, if you will. But again, the US market, as Radhi knows and everyone else knows, is a choppy market. Projects happen and then they don't. I mean, it's all kind of laden in politics and funding decisions and a lot of things all in. So a mouthful I've just said, but Radhi, how do you think this bill might influence P3s or incentivise P3s in this country? When President Biden was candidate Biden and he released his infrastructure plan, a lot of us have crawled through that to see where P3s came in. And P3s were part of the candidate Biden's plan, but mostly on the green energy, innovative technology approach where private sector innovation and partnering was key. But it didn't form a great part of the candidate Biden's infrastructure proposal. The plan that was released yesterday, again, a little light in details, and it certainly doesn't put P3s front and centre. But at least it's agnostic as to mechanism. And P3s don't come from the federal level down. P3s come from the local level up. So the decision, P3 or not P3, is not a federal decision. The mechanisms for getting federal funding downstream are agnostic as to the procurement methodology. Your TIFIA works perfectly well for design build or a full-blown design build, finance, operate, maintain. It's agnostic as to how it's used. So what does it mean for P3s? On transportation, the more volume of transactions you have, the more P3s you're likely to have. It's as simple as that. And you don't have any P3s if you're not doing any transactions. So if the money is coming down from the feds and long-delayed projects are happening, then the projects that make sense to do as P3s, I think, will be done as P3s as well. We know your P3s are not right for every project by any means at all. If you look at the more developed P3 markets, typically they're 8% to 15% of the projects are done as P3s in the developed P3 markets. Generally the ones with more complexity where the risk transfer makes sense to bring in a private party to take more of that share on. And heaven knows the US has many of those complicated projects. Many of those 10 bridges that Biden specifically called out are complicated projects in developed urban areas with a very small footprint to work within. And P3s and private innovation risk transfer around those work well with those types of complicated projects. So I think P3s will do well if this program comes to fruition just on volume alone. But this program is also rife with innovation, R&D, and an invitation to public authorities and private investors to put their thinking caps on and do things in a different way. There's a lot of potential money in there for innovation, for new energy sources, smart city initiatives, and that's where the private sector can really come to the floor. I think a private sector operator could look at these proposals and meld many of them together, many different sources, maybe some tax and financing, some grants, and some new approaches and come up with a project which addresses many needs in one. I mean, there's been a lot of talk of smart city initiatives and smart city developments over the last five to 10 years. But this program, if implemented, the prospect of really giving that a shot in the arm, and again, that's where the private sector would really show its value. Okay. So let's talk about smart cities. That's, again, that is, to your point, it's been talked about more than executed on quite yet. Probably the more noticeable project that we saw in North America was Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners was trying to do a smart city concept in Toronto, and that didn't really, that just fell through. And haven't seen much else yet other than, I think, some of these smart lighting projects that we've seen come and go over the years have certainly embraced the smart city concept. And I think, Roddy, if I'm not mistaken, the mobility program in Georgia is trying to embrace something like this in how they're doling out their road program. Let's talk about how this bill could help with smart city development. What are some of the elements you're seeing out there that could help develop this? Well, it helps to ask, what is a smart city development? Ooh, that's another big question. I mean, like P3s, it's very much in the eye of the beholder, but the essence of a smart city project or innovation is one which kind of looks at an urban setting and identifies a problem and tries to find a solution to that using technology. That's one way of looking at it. And the Biden plan is keenly focused on quality of life issues and improving people's homes, local transportation issues, all of which kind of hit the smart city spot on. So everything from technical innovation and affordable housing to improving your urban transit, that's all that's all your smart city, smart city relevant. Part of the trouble with smart city initiatives has been funding, funding sources, and you're trying to create revenue from these projects. And that's been a problem. And it's not been easy to kind of identify, you know, beyond advertising and Wi-Fi, where the revenue sources are potentially to support these projects, maybe parking fees and sidewalk usage fees and the like, too. But it's been difficult to kind of make these projects self-sustaining. And when you look at the Biden plan, that is your potentially seed money and investment money to get projects off the ground, your proof of concept approaches, too. So it has the potential to kind of get over that hurdle of, you know, getting a few projects up and running to see, you know, so that they become murky projects and suddenly everybody wants one. And if there's some federal funding to kind of help bridge the gap and make projects which are, you know, very sensible and be real quality of life improvers, but have been difficult to get financed before, there's a possibility of some of this green energy, you know, technology funds or your transit funds, which are being directed to urban environments being used in this way. I think it could, you know, really be a great push in the smart city initiative. Great. To finish it off, Roddy, we're going to throw a loaded question at you. So you have new jobs, you're rebuilding infrastructure, and there's definitely bipartisan support at Congress as evidenced by some of the infrastructure proposals proposed in the first quarter of the year. The proposal includes being funded by corporate tax hikes. President Biden dared anyone to enter the room yesterday and said, well, come up with proposals, I'll listen to you. But it's not going to be involving taxing people in the middle class. He made that very clear yesterday in his speech. So it seems like corporate tax hikes is going to be the funding mechanism to start off with. Is this going to be enough to still get a bipartisan bill passed even after all that? Or are we going to wind up going into reconciliation the way we did with the CARES Act? That's going to be a very easy one to finish on, John. My crystal ball is as clear as everyone else's. I mean, it's, you know, infrastructure traditionally has the prospect of being bipartisan. You know, it's a jobs bill in many ways, which is where... It already is bipartisan. We've seen it by some of these proposals, clearly both sides of the House and Senate have agreed on a few proposals already in the first quarter. So it's there. For sure. Absolutely right. These projects are ultimately local projects and your politicians like bringing projects home. So if they can get on board with this project and point to a new bridge or new schools or wherever it might be locally, then that's a win for them. So there's a lot of political pressure to get this thing moving. On the other side of the table, Biden is proposing a significant tax increase to cover this, which will not garner significant bipartisan support. As you mentioned in his announcement yesterday, he clearly drew the contrast between his tax increase and the tax cut from the last administration, kind of was quite quite blunt in saying that, you know, that tax cut had a massive impact on federal revenues. And this is going in the opposite direction and he was daring people to challenge it. You're being quite clear that he's looking to redress what he sees as being an imbalance and he's challenging folk to say no to his program. I'm bipartisan, I'm not. I don't see any possibility of the tax increase being bipartisan. This is a plan that's going to fall into many separate pieces of legislation. There's certainly some of this legislation that will be more bipartisan than others. But it is largely doable by reconciliation and the Biden administration has shown itself to be willing to get the best person in there to cast that vote. So I'm going to walk the line and say that certain elements of this program, this plan, when broken out into separate pieces of legislation will be easier to garner bipartisan support as some already have. But ultimately, I don't see any bipartisan support for the tax increase, which kind of underlies this plan overall. But I could well see the Biden administration just biting the bullet and getting that done through reconciliation as being a key part of his policy agenda. So watch this space. Yeah. Well, it's going to be an interesting couple of months. But for now, we are going to go into congressional recess and have to pick up the debate in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, Roddy, thank you for getting on the podcast today. Really appreciate your time. Appreciate that. Thank you for having me. For the listeners out there, well, you have opening day of baseball later today and Easter weekend to look forward to. So thanks for listening in today. And we'll look forward to hearing from you next time around. Berk out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2021-03-19 18:18:11+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Interview with James Wright of CIBC\n**Episode ID:** 4340\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the latest edition of the Crossroads podcast. Joining me today is James Wright, head of Renewables, Clean Energy and Sustainability for CIBC in the US. James, welcome to today's program. Thanks, John. Great to be here. Thanks for having me on. So Mr. Wright joins us today against the backdrop of the Biden administration pushing for the New Green Deal as one of the linchpins to his campaign. Whether this starts to be realized in the form of a big infrastructure spending bill or not, there is no doubt that alternative energy development ranging from offshore energy to green hydrogen and onto carbon capture are and will be major economic drivers as the US and states push to accelerate the pace of carbon emissions reduction. Towards that aim, earlier this week, the US Department of Energy launched a $75 million grid storage launchpad in Washington state designed to develop and deploy long duration low cost grid energy storage. To that end, James, can you start by outlining the benefits of this project and how it can benefit the battery storage space and then outline what some of the challenges are in the space today? Absolutely. So I think it's a very positive signal for how the new administration is already leaning into these technologies that we'll be talking about on the pod today. The launchpads really being conceived from my perspective as sort of an incubator for testing and research of these emerging battery solutions as they head towards larger scale commercialization. It's really that simple from what we've been reading. But look, taking a step back, why is that? I think the bigger picture here on the battery storage side is that it's going to be a really important piece of the pie to address the intermittent dispatch problem we have with renewables. And we're seeing this more and more as renewables penetrates the grid deeper. So folks may have heard about the famous California dot curve as one exemplar of that. From my perspective, the financing markets are now much more attuned to why these storage assets will be an important piece of the puzzle, with batteries being the sort of hallowed solution here to enable that generation fleet to really take off on the renewable side. I think the main challenge here at the moment is really the range of technical solutions that are out there. So they've each got their own potential usage case, varying levels of deployment track record. And that's kind of where the crux of the challenge lies. Just to delve a little deeper into that for a second, I think it's worth spending a minute on, there's very broadly two buckets of energy storage approaches out there. The first of what I sort of think of as the physical or kinetic solutions, including pumped hydro, compressed air storage, gravity storage, and then there's a whole second bucket of chemical battery solutions like lithium ion, lithium metal, flow batteries, even NICAD and lead. So although many of the fundamental base technologies here have been known for a long time, I think it was Sony who first commercialized the lithium ion battery about 30 years ago now. There's not a lot of deployment or operating data at grid scale for these new usage cases. So depending on the particular market, there's a range of what I think of as revenue routes for these technologies, including acting as capacity providers, provision of ancillary services, frequency response, or even arbitrage plays. So that's the main challenge I see from the technology side. It's also highly fragmented in terms of the OEMs compared with the wind and solar sector, where we're used to seeing a few handful of very well-known turbine panel inverter manufacturers. On the storage side, there's really many, many handfuls of providers out there. Why don't we start talking about technology that's there today and currently just starting to emerge in the U.S. in the form of offshore wind. And then let's move to some of these newer technologies that are coming up, carbon capture as well as green hydrogen. Absolutely. So I love talking about offshore wind, John. I like reminding people as an Englishman, it's old world technology that's coming to the new world. We've had these turbines deployed at scale now back in Europe for going on 25 years, and there's an entire industry built around their infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, therefore, when we think about the U.S., we're seeing the major European players dominating the investment landscape, Equinor, Allstead, Avangrid, Shell, BP, EDPR, ONG. Those are the key ones. The continual evolution of the technology is truly remarkable, though. We've gone from about less than one megawatt machines to now having 12 megawatt plus machines that are going to be talked about on the East Coast. These are 300 meter high installations, so just huge pieces of infrastructure, allowing for very high capacity factors, pretty competitive levelized cost of energy on the East Coast that will feed quite a lot of baseload into markets like PJM. I think the major challenge will be a couple of things. Firstly, the logistics supply chain for building and operating these projects. There's a lot that goes behind that. We have some structural challenges in the U.S. through things like the Jones Act that will need to be worked through on the vessel side, as well as the appropriate planning for port and transmission infrastructure for where these projects will interconnect to the grid. Second thing I'd just highlight with offshore wind would be on the financing side, there are some questions around just the capacity within the tax equity market. The new 30 percent ITC for offshore wind is certainly helpful, but it means that some of those pipeline projects are going to really be looking to feed two billion plus of tax equity each into the market when they come online, which is really significant if you think about a market that up until now has been about 12 billion a year of total tax equity demand. So, those are a couple of things on offshore wind. If we go then on to the other technologies you touched on, I think CCUS is really where we're getting into what I think about as the technologies of tomorrow, so carbon capture and sequestration. This one is really addressing the other side of the climate coin, if you like. So, renewables are clearly crucial for reducing the carbon intensity of the electricity sector, but we've also got to adopt solutions that remove the unavoidable emissions from other sectors that will inhibit us from getting to those, you know, 2050 net zero goals, which is really where the science is telling us we need to be to avoid catastrophe. So, scrubbing or sequestering that CO2 is what we're talking about here. The base technology for some of those solutions is very well known, for example, injecting CO2 into wells for enhanced oil recovery, and that's been done for a long time in places like the Permian. Newer, more radical applications, such as direct air capture, where, you know, we can literally scrub the CO2 from the air at scale, these could be potentially game changing, but they are untested at scale. I think the typical investors we're going to see here will be, in the first instance, midstream, downstream oil and gas companies where they really have experience dealing with the molecules, if you like, fundamentally supportive end usage cases for the CO2, and they've also, most importantly, got their own net zero emission goals to strive towards. The broader CCUS theme also represents interesting net zero avenues for sectors that have thus far been pretty untouched, actually, by the energy transition. So, if you think about other significant emitters within heavy industry, one really good example is concrete production, where there are solutions out there now to inject that CO2 into the concrete in the manufacturing process and also improve its curing time as a result. So, I think CCUS is going to be a really big one, and we're already seeing some interesting projects coming through on the US side. The last one that you mentioned, hydrogen. So, this feels in many respects like, to me, one of those potential holy grail solutions for the sector that have, for parts of the sector that have had technical barriers to the energy transition. So, for example, the transportation space, whilst EVs are really a game changer for the car market, there are issues with batteries as a potential solution for trucking and freight rail in terms of energy density, battery weight, and just the logistics around a sort of national charging infrastructure, if you like, of that sort of scale. So, hydrogen fuel cells have been seen as a real option for long-distance trucking, for example, where existing refueling infrastructure is really designed to handle those molecules, not really electrons today. And look, there are many potential paths to this hydrogen we're talking about. There's different colours, if you like, that's attributed to it. So, you've got brown hydrogen, grey hydrogen, blue hydrogen, but truly green hydrogen is where it's being produced from renewable power electrolysis, and that's what folks are really focused on at the moment. Europe's currently leading the US here, significant funding coming from the EU, as well as emerging regulatory frameworks to be supportive there. But it's already been identified by the folks within the Biden administration as being a key piece of the climate agenda. So, I think that's the sort of medium-term goal we're heading towards. Terrific. Thanks for that. So, let's go to how you bank these technologies. You know, as you pointed out, they're all at various stages of development, some proven, some unproven. From your perspective as a banker in this industry, it'd be nice to get some thoughts about how yourself and your peers need to adapt to the development of these different technologies from a project finance perspective. Yeah, it's a great question. It's funny because speed of change is always a real challenge in the project finance space. I've been doing this for 20 plus years, and it's a sector that sometimes feels like you're steering an oil tanker. It doesn't always do well with speed of change. I think wherever we can, it's helpful to be able to draw a line between these emerging technologies and known sort of existing areas of the project finance market. So, for example, from a technology perspective, offshore wind in the US will obviously leverage heavily off European contractual and financing structures, as we just talked about. So, there's a clear line that can be drawn there between the US deals we'll see and the European deals that have been done. For areas like CCUS, I think a line can also be drawn from midstream oil and gas financing. Batteries are a bit more of a challenge in that respect, again, because there's no obvious sort of origin story, if you like, within the project finance market. And because of that sort of disparate range of revenue cases that are out there, that's part of the challenge I think we see on the battery side. Solar plus storage could be a bridge to that, and we're seeing a lot more of that coming through. Project finance is really fundamentally about risk allocation, and I'm pretty confident that supporting financing structures will continue to evolve in that space. I'd also just note, I think it's worth making the comment that typically project finance lenders, they want to see deployment at commercial scale, right, before technology is thought to be ready for prime time from a senior secure lending perspective. And it's worth remembering that the majority of the project finance lenders issue L plus 200 or below paper for what they think of as a commensurate risk profile. So it's really about risk allocation from that perspective. And just last quick comment on that, you know, typically it'll also, I think, be the larger, better capitalized sponsors that will be best placed to help spearhead these new technologies within the project finance market. There's obviously an inherent comfort factor there as a lender, plus they will have the balance sheet to help those risk allocation exercises. And that's not to say there's not an important role for smaller developers, they're crucial to this, but there's the overall equity story will be an important piece of the puzzle for sure. Well, you kind of raised an interesting point that I'd like to explore a little bit here. Let's just go back to carbon capture for a second, where we talked about the midstream companies being more equipped to develop this market. Obviously, as you've observed in others, a lot of deal flow has gotten into midstream, if you will, in 2017, 2018, 2019, you know, conventional MLP structures trading into big infrastructure funds. Do you foresee, or are you already observing that because of the carbon emission reduction issue that's overhanging with them, that they're starting to ask about this kind of development capital from their lenders? Are you getting that sense yet, or are we still a little too early? Yeah, I think we're a little early on what you're calling as development capital, John. I think we're certainly seeing one or two of the deals in the US with some of those midstream players coming towards starter construction. I think shovels are going in the ground, possibly on one or two of those this year. I think development capital is going to be a much broader discussion, I think, once the sector's got a bit of runway under its belt. But yeah, look, I think certainly on the construction side, we're going to see a few of those come to the market this year. And then, you know, from what I'm hearing and seeing, it's really going to take off much more in 2022 and 2023. So we're really thinking about this much more through the medium and long term, from the financing perspective. What kind of financing structures work on projects like these versus conventional renewable assets? I can't believe I'm using the term conventional here. It is what it is. What different financing structures are we seeing here? Yeah, no, it's funny, isn't it? Because when we have these conversations, solar and wind feels a bit boring now. But it's really hard to generalize there. It's fair to anticipate that, you know, outside of offshore wind, many of these newer technologies that we're sort of touching on today won't necessarily benefit from, you know, the 20, 25 year plus busbar type of PPA structures that we've all been used to seeing in the more conventional wind and solar spaces. Those have really been the kind of anchor of what's got these kind of gigawatts and gigawatts of financing done in the solar and wind space. There will be varying elements of market and price risk, depending on the technology and its end market use case. So, again, the project finance market does have precedent financing technology to address volume and price risk within deals. We've seen that historically in sectors like conventional gas power markets and downstream pet cam markets. I think ultimately those financing structures allow sponsors to get to, you know, an acceptable sort of debt to total cap, if you like, in terms of upfront leverage to get a closing equity case on a deal, but then appropriately allocate that downside performance risk back to the sponsor post-construction, i.e. it's equity that really kind of will probably need to bear the majority of that end market risk as these technologies get going. And, again, it's a little bit like PF 101 from that perspective, who's the party best place to absorb those risks? And in many respects, on the back end, it's going to be equity versus debt, I think, in the early days. With costs being high, let's talk about the current tax regime for these projects. Getting back to the broader issue of the Biden administration, whether any help is coming from the administration as we sort of plot out what the infrastructure bill might look like in the coming months? Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, it's really a bit still to be determined. It's obviously very early days in the new administration. You know, the infrastructure spending bill negotiations are really just kicking off. We've got to see how those play out. I think the recent offshore wind tax credits are a very meaningful shot in the arm for the sector. Although, as we noted briefly earlier when we were talking about offshore wind, it remains to be seen from my perspective just how much the tax equity market will be able to absorb those deals and whether it remains only a handful of players who can really be relevant there. But, for sure, the offshore wind tax credit is a great example of where there's going to be, I think, some early wins from a sort of monetary policy perspective, if you like, within the sector. Equally, as we think about some of the other technologies we've touched on, the carbon capture space, the Treasury issued its guidance on utilization of the 45Q tax credit last year, specifically laying out the usage cases that will qualify for the credit, the rates of enhanced oil recovery versus non-enhanced oil recovery type solutions, sort of construction rules, et cetera, et cetera. It's going to be, I think, very helpful for the tax equity market to have just that confidence around financing those credits and giving the potential size and scale, actually, of some of those CCUS deals. It's structurally a bit of an easier credit the way it's been designed for the market to absorb than, say, the ITC in the case of offshore wind. So, I think that's really positive. And look, it's still really, I think, to be determined what federal tailwinds will emerge for things like battery storage and green hydrogen. There's draft legislation, I believe, currently in both houses on the battery side with a good degree of bipartisan support, so we could be optimistic there, maybe on the battery side. But, arguably, both of these technologies that we were talking about in that last bucket, you know, batteries and green hydrogen, both of those will warrant some more monetary policy incubation at the federal level, even if it's indirectly through a sort of, you know, technology agnostic approach, if that makes sense. So, we're in wait-and-see mood on that. To that point, what has happened is that Jigar Shah, the one-time founder of SunEdison and founder of Generate Capital, was recently appointed to head the Department of Energy's loan program, currently seeing about $40 billion of capacity, if I was reading the website correctly this morning. You know, there is the specter of more federal help could be on its way, you know, through some of these developing technologies, depending on how these loans get doled out. Yeah, I hope so. I mean, as a sort of general comment, I do think government plays a crucial role in creating these sort of right incentive systems for the private sector to step up its game in the energy transition. You know, I remember Bill Gates actually made this observation, right, that the sort of challenge with – when you think about energy innovation specifically, these technologies typically have a really, really long payoff period from first inception through to mass commercialization, if you like. So, again, kind of, in many ways, back to that Project Finance 101 type of comment, who's the best party to absorb multi-decade commercialization risk? It's probably the federal government in the first instance, rather than corporate America, right? You know, there are parallels there, actually, if you go back through history, if you think about Department of Defense and NASA and all the sort of historic leaps we've made through things like nuclear energy, you know, jet propulsion, global communications. So, that's the kind of parallel I draw there. Look, I hope with Jigar's private sector and clean tech background, he'll be very well placed to help be a bridge to that type of thinking within the DOE. There may be a challenge to not spread the program too thin across so many potential markets and technologies that we've touched on, where, you know, it could be potentially, therefore, ineffective and doesn't move the needle so much. But I think, you know, as I think about the space, a key determinant of success will be really the sort of efficiency and responsiveness of these programs. You know, the clean tech sector is moving incredibly quickly these days. DOE will need to keep up with that and move at the same pace that the private sector is really used to moving at to be effective, I think. Are we at a point where solar plus storage projects are going to start to compete more regularly with conventional projects? Or is it too early to make it a part of the regular menu, if you will? No, I don't think we're too early. We're seeing a lot of that that's been coming through the sort of financing pipeline the past year or two, and even more going into next year already. I think we're probably there, but it's going to be market dependent. You know, the supportive market frameworks for those projects will no doubt continue to evolve within the various regional transmission organizations. We're certainly seeing a lot more of those paired solutions, if you like, coming to the market already this year, particularly in places like Kaiso, Southwest, PJM. Interestingly, just as an aside, if I think about what happened in Texas a couple of weeks ago, arguably having more of those kind of paired solutions with wind and storage even could have been a potential mitigant to some of those problems. So I certainly don't think it's too early. We're seeing a lot more deal flow coming through on that side. And solar and storage is one tool in the toolbox. It's not the only tool, but it's a very important tool. Let's cap it off with your favorite sector again, going back to offshore wind. There's obviously a lot of promising developments out there on the East Coast, just to name a handful, the Maryland Wind Project, and then these Long Island projects, Empire Wind and Beacon Wind. What other developments do you see out there as pushing the industry forward? Yeah, I mean, those ones you listed are all huge projects. I think they're going to be very well received in the market, given the experience of the sponsors and strength of those sponsors behind them. I think lenders and investors have already put sort of capital to work in that space. Back in Europe will clearly be on the front foot here. But look, I mean, longer term and thinking about your question more thematically, you know, I believe floating wind is actually going to be really important as well and potentially very thematic for places like the West Coast, right? If you think about some of the structural challenges there for a second, it's really just geography. The seashelf topography is really not that suited to conventional fixed bottom installations. I think the shelf drops off thousands of feet when you only get a couple of miles offshore. So that's where floating wind comes in. Again, Europe is a bit ahead of us here. They've already deployed, started deploying floating wind in various parts of Europe. So that could provide real meaningful baseload to those West Coast states with aggressive net zero targets, California being the key example there, with low profiles that very nicely complement onshore solar, for example. There are a few actually Department of Defense, interestingly, challenges there, environmental challenges just to overcome in places like California. But I think we're seeing we're seeing folks already being quite on the forefront there. You know, one example would be companies like Principal Power, who've done this back in Europe and are now very active on the West Coast. Outside of offshore wind, I also see, you know, those potential tax incentives we talked about earlier as creating tailwinds for those more nascent battery and hydrogen markets. Those subsidy structures are going to recreate much more of an attractive risk-adjusted return profile for investors, I think, as they think about these spaces and how they can push these technologies further forward. So I do think back onto that monetary policy point we're talking about earlier, that's going to be crucial. And look, you know, finally, more broadly, even still, I think some bigger picture thinking around things like a carbon tax or some form of federal low carbon fuel standard would be the type of moonshot governmental nudge that would really create material incentives to the private sector. So those are my thoughts there, John. Well, James, I feel like we could have a month to two month long series going into some of more of these issues. Absolutely. Nevertheless, we really do appreciate the time you've given us today. And thanks for listening. And please tune in next time for another edition of the Crossroads Podcasts. Berk out.

My name is Brendan Malkin, editor of Information EMEA. And welcome to Information EMEA's first Crossroads podcast. So we're following in the footsteps of my US esteemed colleagues who've been doing podcasts for several months now. Today, our first one is about investing in greenfield infrastructure in the UK. So I'm joined today by Giles Frost. Giles is the Director of International Public Partnerships, IPP, a well-known greenfield investor based in London. He's also Chairman of AMBER Infrastructure. I'm also joined today by Greg McClymond, who's an Executive Director for Public Affairs at IFM Investors. Greg is also a former MP and Shadow Minister of State for Pensions. Before I sort of kick off proceedings, I wanted to sort of set the scene quickly. So based on the kind of information zone statistics, greenfield investing last year held up pretty well in the UK during the crisis, particularly renewables. According to our figures, 11 billion of deals reached financial close in the renewable space the last year, which was significantly up on the year before. Also, quasi PPPs, obviously the PF2 model and PFIs are no longer being procured. So we're talking here about student accommodation, roads, healthcare, and so on. There was such a shrive, 660 million of deals done last year versus a much larger 1.9 billion in 2019. So that kind of sets the scene. So I really wanted to discuss the fact that I guess at the moment there's an awful lot of optimism around investing into greenfield infrastructure. We've seen from the UK government's own National Infrastructure Strategy, which came out last year, and also it's 2020 Spending Review, which committed to spend something in the region of 500 billion into infrastructure over the next five years. So Greg, I just wanted to start with you, perhaps, is this a big opportunity for an investor like yourself and others like us, would you say? I guess the starting point probably is that ambition, which the UK government is demonstrating, you know, to really significantly increase investment into the infrastructure space. Government often talks about it in terms of capital expenditure more broadly, and sometimes it's difficult in government's language to distinguish between infrastructure purely and broader capital expenditure. But certainly we know there is a real appetite from the government to go big on infrastructure as part of its levelling up and net zero programmes. And I guess from an IFE point of view, as a very big investor in core economic infrastructure, it's really what the Global Infrastructure Fund of IFM does on the equity side and then on the debt side, investing in infrastructure too. We notice that the traditional model for delivering lots of projects in the UK, the private finance initiative, has essentially been killed off. It's had the last rites performed by the May government and now the Johnson government. And with our Build Britain model, we're really trying to offer something to the debate about what kind of financing approach can deliver significant projects in and across the UK. So that's probably our starting point. PSI is gone. That was critical to delivering over 700 projects, I think, by the end of 2018. What's going to replace it? There's lots of talk around the Thames Tideway model. We know that mixture of regulated asset base, contract for difference, debt underwriting by the government, first loss insurance and so on. So we're really proposing another approach for the toolkit that the government might bring to its thinking about large scale projects. Charles, the other day, the government talked about potentially large private investment demand from the government through its new plans for the UK infrastructure bank, which with its quote, 22 billion of capital firepower, potentially 8 billion through larger infrastructure schemes, which may well possibly involve the private sector. This all kind of on paper seems very exciting. I think it is exciting. It's because it's a partial answer to the obvious question that most of us had in the infrastructure investment world of what was going to happen given the lack of availability of the EIB, the European Investment Bank for infrastructure projects. So it's definitely a step in the right direction. I think it's really important though to understand what it is that Treasury has in mind for the National Investment Bank. And I think there's probably two kind of two points to make and one sort of question really. And the first is that, you know, there are pains to say the Treasury pains to say that the NIB will not be there to displace private capital, it's not there to compete with private capital, which obviously is good news. I don't think anyone thought it was, but I think it's helpful to have that, you know, set out. I think the second point that's also been made quite clearly by Treasury and the Infrastructure Projects Authority, is that this is not some sort of backdoor reintroduction of the private finance initiative or PFI or anything like that. So I think for those people who hope that there's a kind of, you know, long shopping list of projects, which are going to have sort of, you know, clearly defined private sector investment requirements attached to them, those people are going to be disappointed. So the NIB isn't there as a sort of facilitator of programmes of new investment. And so I suppose it does beg the question a little bit as to what the NIB's role is going to be, because if it's not going to displace private capital, and it's not going to be a originator of new projects itself, I suppose it leaves the NIB as being a sort of filling, you know, what you might say is a slightly sort of hard to define gap in the market of those projects, which are investable. So, you know, are attractive to investment, because the NIB is going to be run on commercial lines, yet somehow are not attracting capital. And I think, you know, for those in the business, it's not totally clear at the moment, what projects would fall into that kind of sort of loose gap between what can be done in the moment and what can't. Because I think many of us practitioners would say, you know, the main reason why more projects in, I don't know, electric vehicle charging, for instance, aren't being done, is because actually the economics and revenue structures, you know, aren't yet sufficiently developed for mainstream investors to be confident in them. Giles, thank you. Thank you for that. I suppose it does take us on to a sort of related point, which is around what is the kind of pipeline. So there is this talk around a lot of government sort of capital firepower coming in. But what are these schemes exactly? There is a sort of talk of a greater demand for kind of an entrepreneurial spirit, I suppose, within the industry, perhaps, where in the absence of a kind of large PPP pipeline, that it's down more down to the investors themselves to kind of come up with them. Greg, is that something that you concur with? Or you kind of rely more on the government producing the pipeline itself? I mean, I think entrepreneurial spirit is always to be welcomed, isn't it? And certainly, you know, an investor like IFM that runs an open-ended global infrastructure fund of quite a significant size, and there's quite a lot of capital to deploy, is always actively going to be looking to create its own opportunities. But I guess we can't get away from the fact that, you know, absent a pipeline, it's quite difficult to get, to take things concretely forward at any speed. And I think nuclear is a good example of this, isn't it? Now, nuclear is kind of unusual because of the scale of the project and, you know, the levels of construction risk therein. But you can see in the government's apparent ambivalence around the way to fund new nuclear, and indeed, whether it wants to do large-scale new nuclear at all versus, you know, small and modular nuclear reactors. I think the nuclear debate gives one a good insight into just some of the issues government are grappling with. One, is this a technology that we want to further pursue as part of our energy mix from a decarbonisation point of view? And secondly, for government, the issue of, is government prepared to take a direct equity stake, you know, in new nuclear? My reading of the tea leaves is that that's probably the stumbling block. It doesn't want to go down contract for difference route. You know, all the controversy around the, you know, the price paid for Hinkley, but those institutions in the private sector who build nuclear, you know, have not been prepared to take as much of the construction risk themselves as the government wishes them to. And I think that takes you into that, restoring the issues of who bears the risk. Makes sense. And Giles, I suppose, if you're looking at the pipeline itself, we touched there upon an interesting point around making projects economically viable for investors like yourselves, but investors like yourselves also want scale. I think just touching a point we just raised there with Greg around this kind of idea of an entrepreneurial spirit. How do you kind of fit all that together? On the one hand, you've got a kind of government keen to invest, but you've got private investors who want scale. They want projects which they can invest in, and maybe ones where they actually have to take things up under their own steam. And in the meanwhile, we've got this kind of complex demand for all sorts of new infrastructure. It is a bit of a confused landscape, because on the one hand, you've got investors, including people like IFM, some of the biggest pension fund managers in the world, who are almost awash with capital, which wants to go into low-risk, long-term infrastructure-type investments, which they expect or hope will give long-term, steady returns that ultimately fund their pension obligations. You've got the government promoting, and this applies to all governments, I think, really, but we've got the government promoting the need for very significant investment to facilitate the climate change objectives we've got, as well as the other infrastructure needs that come from a changing economy, an ageing population, and all those other pressures. And there is, frankly, a disconnect in the market at the moment, because we've tried an approach where the government went out with its own list of projects and procured financial solutions to them. That was called PFI and PPP. It was, I think, successful in terms of infrastructure delivery, very successful in terms of infrastructure delivery. It was politically a failure, because it was hijacked, in a sense, and in the popular view, at least, was seen as a kind of privatization of the nation's assets, which I think had elements of accuracy to it, but also quite important elements, which never quite got the light of day in terms of the popular debate. But I mean, I don't think it matters. I think that ship has sailed. And you've got a little bit of uncertainty as to how this sort of gap is going to be bridged. Now, I don't think any of us infrastructure investors can expect, as of right, for government to bring forward a long list of projects just to make money out of. That would be unrealistic. So, I do think we need to go back to not quite a fully kind of Victorian approach to infrastructure, where you are kind of building it with great hope and hoping that people will come and use it. But I do think that we need to have methods where the private sector, be they developers or investors, can bring ideas to government, effectively retain the intellectual property in those ideas, and if those ideas are supported, can then build out and invest in those ideas. So, I think a hybrid approach, which encourages more innovation in infrastructure development, would be fantastic. And at the moment, I don't think the kind of rules of the game are really allowing for that. And do you sense, Giles, that in some ways, looking at things like the energy transition, what we are now, where we were maybe 10 years ago with kind of wind and solar, and that the same may also apply with other points you just raised there about the fact that we're dealing now with an ageing population, as well as the sort of climate change and so on. Is there a long road to go? So, we're potentially looking at a long road of private investors bringing bright new ideas. I think I'd actually sort of argue that, you know, the energy transition has actually been, you know, quite a good, you know, it's obviously a huge success story in terms of the proportion of our nation's energy that's generated from renewable sources. And I mean, the government largely achieved that by allowing the private sector to develop wind farms, which is obviously where most of it comes from, offshore wind farms, but also other sources of generation. They did it against a regulatory backdrop, which was, you know, published and understood. And they did it against a backdrop where there was support for power prices, whereby the developers knew that if they could build the wind farms and surmount the technological challenges of doing so, then they were guaranteed effectively a minimum price for electricity. So, in that sector, that works, and I think has worked and continues to work really, really well. And the important thing there, I think, is to look at the government intervention, which brought that about, which was effectively to underpin the prices at which the developers could sell their electricity. Now, if you can develop similar mechanisms in other sectors, I think that would be very helpful. But again, you know, I don't want to appear that I'm just criticising the government here, because I think in other sectors, it's very, very hard to get that same level of kind of revenue support, because with electricity, you're producing a commodity that's being sold, and we all understand about how we pay our electricity bills. If you're talking about other sorts of climate change initiative, you don't have a natural revenue stream that goes with them necessarily. And therefore, you either need to invent that that revenue stream, because I don't know, hypothetically need to introduce, you know, carbon based road pricing that we were driving on the roads, which obviously has its own political challenges. Or you have to invent a more explicit subsidy regime by which government will encourage these things. And both those things are fraught with practical difficulties. Thank you, Giles. And Greg, in your own report to the UK government, you highlighted some of your own case studies, as you call it, which you find particularly exciting for different reasons. But one probably possibly worth highlighting is the Greater Montreal Light Rail Scheme, which is a project in Canada, for the development of a large all electric public transportation network. Do you expect those kinds of schemes to kind of come their way in this country? And are these schemes kind of guiding your way forwards? Or are you interested in some of these entrepreneurial ideas as well that we've discussed? Yeah, very good question. I think the Canadian example, which is a very interesting one, you know, where the National Pension Fund of Quebec essentially has taken on from scratch, and in a partnership with the federal and provincial authorities to deliver the, you know, the transit system, the light rail system in Montreal. I think that's interesting. And partly because it's innovative, you know, that kind of partnership between government and pension funds, I think is quite striking on a large scale transport project. And then I think what IFM, we would say, is that, you know, if you are an investor like IFM owned by pension funds, you know, you're representing a form of capital, I suppose, which is, you know, has the ability to be in line with its liabilities long term. And can you take that, you know, that profile, and the fact as an institution over 25 years, IFM has grown to be pretty big, and developed quite a lot of expertise to offer a potential partnership with government on significant projects, where government and the, you know, the pension capital partner get together at the outset, you know, and take the project on from the beginning. And I guess that's where the departure point from PFI comes in, and what has encouraged our development of this approach, this potential approach is, you know, the critique of PFI, and, you know, some of the critique of PFI is justified, for sure, some of it's not. But that model where, you know, it was everything had to be bid together, and it made it difficult to get the risk transfer right, because you had a lot of short term capital involved. And, you know, on the financing side, is there a way to design a, you know, a model, which harnesses pension capital in the long term nature, and therefore provides on that side of things, you know, the incentive to not only build the Greenfield project, but actually to operate it and maintain it over the long term, in return for a significant equity stake. So that's sort of, I guess, the background to the development of the Build Britain model, can we get that long term alignment of the form of capital and, you know, and the actual life cycle of a significant asset. And for sure, that's a contribution to the debate. There's no suggestion that it's, it will be ideal in every circumstance, or indeed any circumstance in particular, it's something to take to the table, and to discuss with government and say, look, have you thought about doing things this way? Gerald's point about the National Infrastructure Bank, his points are very well taken. I mean, it's not quite clear yet in the UK context, what the NIB is there to do, to Gerald's point. But certainly, and on the equity side, you know, how far is it going to get involved in, you know, allocating equity as opposed to just debt? And we are certainly keen to discuss with the NIB as it, you know, as it looks to develop its mandate. You know, is there a significant place for long term equity partnerships between the Infrastructure Bank and infrastructure investors? Lots of interesting points there, Greg, and I suppose, I guess, effectively procurement of infrastructure, if we are talking about projects, perhaps, and obviously, the greater Montreal Light Rail system is one of those you refer to. But I guess this is a point you've already raised, but we could look at it in more detail, perhaps, Gerald, with the sort of demise of PFIs, PF2s, for whatever reason, those procurement models have been scrapped. People now talk about different models, RAB models, contracts for difference. What's your thoughts in terms of the clarity around that? Is it going to be a case of different models for different projects? I think we've probably gone through the era of having a kind of single kind of overarching solution to the need for infrastructure in different sectors. And it's also true to say that a lot of the social infrastructure, which was a focus of things like PFI, has actually been renewed, and therefore that there's, you know, the need there is diminished. I mean, the regulated asset base model or RAB model you mentioned is interesting. I mean, one of the projects that we are developing is the Thames Tideway Tunnel. That is a new wastewater tunnel being built directly beneath the bed of the Thames to catch wastewater, which currently floods into the Thames. And that is the, so far, the only, the first only single project financed under the regulated asset base model in the UK. So we're used to a regulated asset base model applying to all sorts of regulated entities in, you know, gas distribution, electricity distribution, and transmission, and so on. But here we had a single asset, a wastewater asset, and then, and effectively, the investors in that are allowed to make permitted return on that capital, the rate of return, which was agreed by Ofwat, the regulator at the outset. And that ultimately is a small chunk of everybody's water bill in the Thames Valley area. So I think, again, you know, I made the point earlier on that it's much, much easier to create models for infrastructure procurement, where you've got an established form of revenue stream, just like electricity, then people are used to paying water bills, and therefore, effectively finding a way to tack a bit on and spread the cost is relatively straightforward. So I think the single asset RAB model, I think, is seen as a success with Tideway. I think there's talk about using that model or variations that model for other big single assets within the water industry. So new reservoirs or major sewage treatment works, those sorts of things. But then when you look at some of the other things that are needed, it's a bit more challenging, because if in fact, climate change means you need to spend two or 3 billion on coastal defences, for instance, then we don't have a mechanism, which is naturally there to support the revenue side of that equation. So I think those are the really difficult cases. And in those sorts of cases, and other sorts of climate infrastructure, the choice really is, does the government pay itself? And we've seen obviously, the government, you know, more willing to take on the risk of large scale capital projects more recently, not always successfully. I think, you know, most of the big highways projects are seen as being reasonably successful. But then the rail electrification projects, and perhaps things like Crossrail, you know, call into question sometimes as to whether the notionally cheaper nature of government capital really translates into a cheaper overall project, once you've taken into account, you know, possible deficiencies in project management, and so on. So I don't want to get into the why's and wherefores of those projects. But, but, you know, that that debate has raged really for, for 25 years. And every time we have a kind of, you know, a disappointing outcome on a government funded scheme that people say, oh, we should use the private sector. And then, you know, the cycle changes. And people say, oh, look, the private sector is making unnecessary profits out of this, we should do it in house. And, you know, I think we're back into an in house type moment in the cycle now. And I'm sure that will, that will change. So, you know, the point I think that's missing in this, and I don't pretend it's a single answer to your question, though, is that under our legal system for procurement at the moment, we don't have a mechanism, which really allows people to bring forward ideas to government. And the procurement rules which applied in or do apply in the European Union, which obviously now, Britain is not necessarily fully subject, subject to were a good thing in many respects, because they ensured open competition, and therefore transparency and, and, and, and value for money. But they didn't really offer a route to people bringing forward good ideas to government, in which some of these things could be addressed. And I think, you know, one one area of optimism, I see in the National Infrastructure Strategy, and hopefully also in the work of the NIB is, is to allow more experiments, if you like, where people have brought forward ideas, and we can see if they work. And if the NIB's role includes, you know, equity or debt support for some of these innovative, untested ideas, I think that would be a good step, big step forward. And those untested ideas you're thinking about there, obviously, it is in early stages, but do you think that might apply across the kind of gamut of everything one conceives of as being the kind of energy transition? I mean, yeah, I think so. I mean, the obvious areas are decarbonisation. And, you know, we've got, we've got, we've got, we've got issues to face with electrification of road transport, which aren't purely about charging. So there's other issues there. And it's not just a question of putting charges, it's a question of the adaptation of electricity grids to bring the right voltages to the right places. There's, you know, there's a wider issue around carbon capture and storage, because it's unlikely in any foreseeable timescale that we'll be able to eradicate carbon generation, or carbon from all aspects of life. There's the ongoing debate about energy storage, and how we can find better ways of storing the intermittently generated electricity from, from renewable sources. And none of those really have a single technical solution. And as a result, at the moment, they don't have an investment solution. Plenty of food for thought there. But Greg, I wanted to pick up something, which is probably quite dear to your heart and your with your pension background is this issue of is there the private capital to support this investment? I mean, obviously, there is a mood of optimism here, which Giles has expressed here. And I suppose from your own point of view, you know, there is the question of, you know, in the UK, we have increasingly seen long term pension capital being aggregated into these pools, now eight pension pools representing almost 90 government pension schemes, which are so much more cohesive investment programme, seems like there's enough capital there. But I think in terms of, you know, your own ideas from your submissions to the government, you're also talking about kind of potentially investment capital coming from further field, obviously, in Australia, there's a wall of capital ready to be deployed into infrastructure. We've seen that already. But do you think there's a lot more that could come this way? Do you think? Yeah, really interesting question. If you take the UK, I think you probably have to distinguish between different parts of the pension fund system. So, certainly, I would say personally, you know, a really useful advance that you have the pools and the local government pension scheme side and you can see this in the emergency platforms, including the infrastructure platform that's been set up relatively recently, you know, start to make those kind of investments. That seems very positive to me. And I think in the corporate DB side, which is, you know, the historical beating heart of the UK pension system, and the cash flow negative nature, you know, of lots of that sector and have implications, you know, the focus is often in corporate DB toward the buy out or buy in, and, you know, on matching liabilities to assets, and then looking to, you know, hand over the risk to an insurance company or to pay out pensions until the last member of the scheme is no longer, you know, drawing a pension. And that has implications in the UK, because that means, you know, that capital tends to be much more in, you know, in gilts and similar bond-like instruments in line with liability-driven investment approaches. So, I think in the UK, you're looking at LGPS and you're looking at, you know, defined contribution and particularly the rise of the auto-enrolment sector. That's clearly, you know, in its early days, auto-enrolment has been going seven or eight years now, but the contributions are pretty low. So, the funds are growing and they're compounding, but, you know, from a zero starting point, that's probably long term going to be a source of capital for investment in these areas. And if you look at IFM, you know, make the comparison, you know, IFM is interested in very long-term investments and reflecting the, in particular as a starting point, that very cashflow positive nature of the Australian defined contribution system. You know, cashflow positivity at the fund level is really important. Our owners, you know, have, you know, regular contributions coming in and a compulsory system across most of the working population every month. And that really encourages a long-term perspective. And we're keen to harness that to investments, you know, in the UK and elsewhere. And, you know, Giles' point about the different models is, of course, really well made. Government are very keen, is my impression on, you know, on the regulated asset-based approach. And I think Giles' point, of course, that, you know, applying one model to sectors with quite different characteristics is a challenge. I would add another challenge, you know, I'm a Thames Water customer, and I certainly noticed that it's quite significant increase in my bill this year. And I suspect part of that's got to do with, you know, the regulated asset-based funding of Thames tidally. And that's certainly something that's always in the government's mind as it weighs up different approaches, you know, in the regulated asset base. The great positive aspect of it is it reduces the cost of debt financing, because, you know, the money's coming direct from consumers to fund the construction phase. But at the same time, of course, it does mean higher bills, you know, for something that's not yet actual or real. And Giles mentioned, too, the water sector more broadly. And you see that in the, you know, I think the challenge government has about how does it get right the balance between what it sees as the duty to, you know, to keep bills as low as possible, and that long-term investment in water infrastructure and energy infrastructure, as Giles laid out, and indeed telecoms infrastructure. That's the kind of, you know, the real gritty political challenge. And again, we wonder whether, you know, something to have in the, you know, in the toolkit is a shared equity model with long-term pension capital. You know, there might be projects we think where that could potentially offer, you know, some attractive characteristics from government's point of view. Someone who can share the burden of actually, you know, the expertise which is necessary to deliver these projects, to Giles' point about for sure government looks like it's keener to do more stuff, you know, on the books, so to speak, you know, publicly funded. But there are clearly challenges as the IPA set out regularly around, you know, the expertise and delivery capability of government. So can it find the right partner for the right project who wants to stick around for the long term and is looking to make, you know, a reasonable return, but not, you know, looking to make excess returns? Interesting. And I suppose that's a point worth picking up maybe with you Giles around, on the one hand, the government needs more of a push, I guess, for publicly funded infrastructure perhaps, but obviously it's making no bones, it still needs private capital, but also needs the expertise of the private sector without a doubt. I guess it does depend on the project, but do you think, what's your kind of take on that particular point there about the idea of kind of the pure equity model, the longer term pension fund capital? Yeah, I mean, I think that the pure equity model works for certain sorts of investors better than others. And I mean, ultimately, what we all want as taxpayers and what government wants is the best value for money solution. And I mean, one of the ideas I've personally promoted for a long time, you know, without huge amounts of success, and that's been adopted in a number of other countries, such as Australia, is actually models or hybrid models where, you know, a large chunk of the capital is provided by the government, but you have a significant stake, be it 10, 15%, whatever it might be, which is provided by the private sector. And, you know, to my mind, that does give quite a beneficial outcome, because it lowers the cost of capital as far as possible by using government debt, which is cheaper than anybody else's cost of funds. But it preserves the kind of skin in the game element that comes from having private sector equity in there, which obviously brings beneficial elements in terms of project management and governance, because, you know, that level of investment, I think, is sufficient to motivate people to really focus on getting the job done to time and on budget, which are the critical things from a customer's point of view, from a stakeholder's point of view. Greg, you've talked in your document to the government about how the government can do more, but you also talk about what governments can do less of, putting more pressure on the private sector. And is there any other thing that you think the government can be doing more to inspire private capital into the sector? Yeah, I think there's clearly lots of issues to unpack there. Let me take one or two, I suppose. From our point of view, I guess, we're really trying to put on the table a proposal that for significant size, economic infrastructure projects, probably broadly defined, then can we find a way between government and pension capital, you know, to put more equity on the table. So, for sure, there'll be other forms of funding as well. But if we think about PFI, you know, the equity layer was often very thin, wasn't it? And it was sold out, sold up, you know, as soon as the project construction was complete. And that had a kind of impact on incentives, you know, which one could link to a short-term approach that might not always be in the long-term interest of that piece of infrastructure and its users. So, I guess that's our starting point. And, you know, if you can get more equity on the table, then it reduces the need for what quickly becomes often pretty complex forms of debt financing. Now, of course, there's other ways. You know, GEL is much more eloquent than me on this. It's set out in terms as a model, you know, when the government's provided first loss insurance and to underpin, you know, the debt which has been brought by pension funds and others. But we think certainly there's a case for trying to simplify. And this, again, is trying to take what government is saying in the UK about, you know, the downsides of PFI model that, you know, opacity and complexity was something which the government really emphasised when it said it would no longer use the model for future projects. We're trying to think, you know, how is a way to reduce the complexity of the contracts? One way we think is to get more equity, you know, on the table. So, that would probably be an important element in any discussions we might have with government. And I think that does lead, if you can do that, you know, we're also seeing potentially, and this goes to the point I made a moment ago around, you know, pension funds are looking to meet their, you know, their needs of pensioners, but they don't need excess returns, converted commas. And therefore, we're certainly open to the idea of, you know, potentially tapping excess returns, which the Scottish model proposed by the Scottish government is a kind of move on from PFI, you know, has some sort of elements of that where, in certain contexts, you know, monies are paid back, which are seen deemed to have been excessive. And we certainly think, you know, we're prepared to discuss that with government. If that's a concern of government, you know, that they get on the wrong side of the, you know, of the contract, you know, we're open to discussions about how you would structure the IRR. I guess on a related point, Giles, I suppose one obvious criticism of the government of building Greenfield infrastructure in this country has been around sort of delays to getting things done on time and to budget. Do you think, kind of, as a country, we're getting better at doing that, or do you think there's more that can be done, or is this not really an issue at this time, would you say? I think you tend to only hear the kind of bad stories, don't you, and therefore, but, you know, Greg, in a sense, made the same point in terms of his willingness to share upside, you know, there are no newspaper headlines when Greg shares his excess profits with people. But if an IFM-backed project is late, or the construction contractor goes bankrupt, and, you know, which is no fault of the investor, and bad things happen, then your name's all over the press. So, you know, I mean, to be fair, I think government is absolutely alive to that. And therefore, you know, there's more mileage in terms of press coverage and sort of popular sentiment in terms of complaining things go wrong when they're right. So, you know, I don't think we should be, you know, if we're going to focus on the sort of failures or things that could have gone better, we should do so in the context of recognising the size of the kind of pie, and the number of projects which have gone well. So I don't think we should be overcritical. But I think there are some lessons to be learned from the past. And, you know, I think one of those is in governance, just to pick a couple of examples. I think one of those is in the governance. And I think the public sector owned and managed projects do have a governance difference from private sector projects, because in the private sector managed projects, then essentially, the only focus is getting a project done on time to budget in compliance with the contract, and the kind of laws that apply to the project. I think inevitably, in publicly owned and managed projects, other considerations come to the fore. And, you know, those considerations, you know, frequently end up with changes of project, you know, not necessarily project direction, but in terms of the detail of project, all of which have impacts generally upwards in terms of in terms of cost, and generally outwards in terms of the timescale. So, and I think there is a sort of category difference, if you like, between public and private projects. But then again, I mean, you know, the private projects aren't immune to issues either. And Greg talked about relative thin capitalization of some projects a generation ago, and the sort of problems that caused and, you know, there's a real problem, for instance, in private sector projects, which are heavily invested into by the construction companies, because if you're a construction company, and you earn the equity in a project, and you're providing construction services, and you get into difficulties, which construction companies seem to do so with depressing regularity, then there's nobody there left to rescue the project, and the construction company has gone bankrupt. And there's nobody left, you know, at the equity table directing what happens next. So, you know, I think both structures have significant difficulties to them. And, you know, for my money, for instance, on the private side, you know, I think there is strong merit in trying to get companies who provide crucial roles in terms of construction or operation and management of facilities to say, you've got to pick and choose, you can either be in the equity or you can be providing the services. If you provide, you can't provide both. Greg and Giles, thank you both very much. That was Giles Frost, who's Director of INPP, and also Greg McClymont, Executive Director of Public Affairs at IFM Investors. I'm Brendan Malkin, Editor of Information and Mayor. Thank you all for listening, and I look forward to seeing you next time for our next Crossroads podcast. Bye for now.

This is Abby Miller back again to host another edition of Information's Crossroads podcast. I have Diana Parks with me, who I have been introduced electronically thus far to through the Women in Infrastructure Network. Diana, welcome to the show. Thank you. I will let you introduce yourself in a little more detail in a moment, but for anyone who doesn't know, Diana has a long history working in the infrastructure and project finance world and now runs her own firm called Parks Infra Solutions. Diana, can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Yes. Thank you, Abby, for the brief introduction. As you mentioned, I've recently opened my own firm after about 20 years of being in the legal field for the infrastructure industry in North America. I have been both in private practice at two large firms focusing on infrastructure and also took in-house positions as senior counsel and vice president to Bechtel Construction and Tutor Perini Construction Companies. I have both experienced representing public owners in private practice and also have a deep understanding of representing the private industry as well. My practice now is both representing public agencies and the private side on large infrastructure transactions around the country. Great. Today, in light of last week's announcement that the Transurban and Macquarie-led Accelerate Maryland Partners were selected for the Capital Beltway Project, Diana and I are going to talk a little bit about pre-development agreements, which is being used in this project. Through this process, the PDA process, it's expected to take at least a year, probably more than a year, and it's something that has largely, especially recently, been praised by the P3 world in hopes that the process prevents underbidding during the RFP phase and eventual cost overruns. Diana, now that a preferred proponent has been selected, what do the next steps look like for the project in terms of developing this PDA? As you said, they just selected the preferred bidder last week. By the terms of the RFP for this project, they will now spend their next few months developing the detailed pre-development agreement that will govern the pre-development process. As you know and saw in the announcement, the preferred proposer here provided a cap on their pre-development fee, which was required in the RFP response, and they also offered the owner a development fee for basically getting the ultimate P3 project. While the bids and the proposals that came in on the RFP for this provided quite a bit of detail as to what services and mechanisms the bidder would utilize if they were selected as the PDA partner, there's still a lot of work to be done in developing the detailed agreement. From what I understand from the RFP and the news releases on this, the PDA is expected to go to the board for approval in April of this year. Then the PDA process, the actual services that will be performed under the PDA, will be done in concert with the stakeholders over the next year to develop the actual design of the project and the best build alternative based on the environmental approvals and working closely with the multiple stakeholders involved in making the ultimate decision as to what this project will ultimately be. Diana, you talked about some of the different stakeholders or how a lot of different stakeholders will be involved throughout the PDA process. In this scenario, who are some of those stakeholders and what's the power dynamic there between them and the consortium? Very good question. In this particular project, you have Maryland DOT, Maryland State Highway Authority, and Maryland Transportation Authority, along with the required approval of the Board of Public Works. You also have FHWA oversight on this project, as well as multiple counties and municipalities. That is quite a complex spaghetti bowl of public stakeholders that all have different interests and different goals, so to speak. Maryland DOT, their interests and goals are to make sure the project is safely built and built in a reasonably time-efficient, cost-effective manner. As I understand it, the Maryland Transportation Authority has to sign off on the mechanism of setting the toll rates. Those two major stakeholders alone have not necessarily opposing interests or goals, but certainly different goals. In working with multiple agencies on other managed toll lanes before, not necessarily a PDA, but just negotiating a straight concession agreement with proposed teams, when you're working with a tolling authority and the authority that's going to own the roads, in my experience, there is a lot of times diverging views. Having the PDA partner at the table to have those candid discussions and developing with all the stakeholders and their various interests and addressing those in advance of putting together the actual commercial terms that will govern the ultimate concession agreement, the 50-year concession agreement, will be very helpful. Otherwise, a lot of times, those agencies are working behind the scenes to develop those terms themselves and then just presenting them to the proposers to bid on. Having this direct conversation with the team that will ultimately be executing this and giving these stakeholders a timeframe and a price and the long-term contract will hopefully be very beneficial to the process. Yeah, that makes sense. To backtrack a little bit, previously, you mentioned something about a development payment. What is that and why did the Accelerate Maryland Partners, why would they have included it in their proposal? Well, from what I understand, that was part of the financial proposal to the RFP that the owners took into account in evaluating the financial proposal and scoring it. And it was basically the willingness of the proposer to pay a development fee for the rights to the concession agreement. I did not see what, if any, the development fee the other proposers offered. But from what I understand from the news release, the selected preferred proposer offered quite a generous development fee to the stakeholders. And that development fee presumably will be paid if they actually sign the 50-year concession agreement and are awarded that. And that would be expected, from what I understand, in late 2022. Right, that makes sense. And so, just to kind of go off of some of what we've been talking about a little, you mentioned that a lot of the work that is coming is some of the work that would have been done by stakeholders ahead of, or I guess ahead of the RFP process, so that the proposer could give those answers during the RFP process in terms of design or price. What other than prior experiences would these proposers be including in their technical and price proposals, since so much work still has to be done? Yeah, that's really the tricky part of a successful PDA, is getting a partner that is truly bringing value to the table and is not just buying their way into the project on conceptual design and conceptual pricing. I thought this RFP was drafted extremely well for a PDA. And I think they came up with a lot of very specific asks of the teams so that they could get a sense of each team's experience in PDAs, their local experience, their experience with tolling authorities and setting tolls. And it also went so far as to require the proposals to include a detailed vision, so to speak, in the proposals as to how each team would approach competitive bids in the long-term concession agreement in the design, finance, and construct, as well as the O&M. While the proposals are conceptual in nature as you hit on, and the work is very fluid and conceptual until a design solution has been approved, I think that in this instance, the RFP solicited enough detail from the teams that the owners got a very good sense of who their partners would be and how they would engage, giving them a peace of mind that they're hiring the best in the industry for this particular project. Definitely. That makes sense. And then, and this is my last question, but we've kind of touched on this throughout, but I figured I would just go ahead and ask it as a flat-out question. On a several-billion-dollar project like this, what is the explicit benefit of this PDA process, and why is this something that the Maryland DOT and the State Highway Administration would have decided to do for this project that they haven't done, considering they haven't done it for other projects, I guess? Well, essentially, going the route of a PDA means that the owners aren't doing the work ahead of time, like I referenced earlier, as far as choosing the design and engaging their own technical advisors to advance the design to a point, usually to about 30 percent, to where then they would be able to articulate in an RFP proposal requirements for that particular build alternative and design. So, you know, it saves going through a PDA process, particularly for a very complicated project such as this, and particularly when there's multiple alternatives or avenues you can take on the approach to the design and build. It does ultimately save time if the PDA works as it's intended, in that the PDA partner comes in and acts as if they are, you know, the owner's technical advisors that the owners would otherwise pay for in advance of the RFP and then solicit the proposals. So, it just, it saves a step and some time, and typically the owner saves money, significant money, in what it would otherwise pay a technical advisor on its side to develop these design alternatives and ideas and develop the technical provisions in the RFP. The PDA partner is essentially coming in and doing that in concert with the owner for the award of getting the ultimate project. So, it helps the owner in upfront costs, and it also helps, you know, the private side really likes PDAs because they don't have to put a hard competitive bid in. They, you know, they win the project on basically what they can offer for reduced or essentially free services to get the ultimate project. Definitely, that makes sense. Well, thank you so much, Diana, for joining us today and having this conversation with me. I think it'll be definitely very interesting over the next year, maybe more, to watch the PDA process unfold, I guess, at least in terms of how much we're clued into it. And I hope everyone listening enjoyed. Bye.

I'm John Burke, America's editor for information news. Joining me today is Dylan Fu, senior partner and co-head of infrastructure for global asset manager, Apollo Global Management. Dylan, thanks for joining today's program. Thanks for having me, John. Looking forward to it. So our topic today, not surprisingly, following the inauguration of President Biden is to look at what trends will emerge in 2021 in infrastructure investing in the U.S. But first I will do a quick review of 2020 from a trends perspective. Our annual league tables with information will be published shortly. It will show in the U.S. and Canada that deal volume was way up in telecom to 16% from 4% year over year. Renewables spiked to 28% from 20% year over year. And energy infrastructure dropped considerably to 28% from 43% year over year. Moreover, deal value was in dollars, sorry, was off slightly at 231 billion in 2020 as opposed to 233 billion in 2019. A remarkable figure considering how frozen the markets were in the spring of 2020 as COVID-19 triggered a massive shutdown across both countries. So Dylan, as an infrastructure manager, perhaps you can walk us through 2020 from an investment standpoint and give us a sense of what were the real obstacles out there and how you were able to overcome those challenges. Yeah, thanks, John. It was a crazy period really in hindsight. I mean, looking back on how much the world has changed in 12 months, it's pretty incredible actually. And I think, you know, as a starting point really for infrastructure, it was a really good test in some ways actually 2020 for the asset class. I mean, infrastructure has really developed a lot and, you know, it was tested somewhat in the 2008 global financial crisis. But if you think about how infrastructure has positioned itself as an asset class in terms of essential, stable, predictable, you know, 2020 in some ways was really the ultimate test for that. And, you know, we've seen different sub-sectors impacted differently. So that was quite an interesting period from that perspective. I think, you know, looking back on how we approached the year and sort of the impacts that we had, I kind of break it up into a couple of things. I think the very first one is really, you know, as a GP and as a manager and a custodian of capital for our clients was really our investor relations and how we were gonna tackle that. We were getting a lot of inquiries inbounds, how our portfolio was performing. And, you know, for some of our pension-based clients, obviously they were suffering from liquidity issues. So we really had to come up with an effective communication strategy. And if I had to summarize that for us at Apollo, it was really over-communicate, be available, work your way through. And, you know, I hadn't even been on Zoom 12 months ago, sitting here in January now, 2021, and really coming up with ways to work with them, communicate the performance of the portfolio and really what our plans were and work with them wherever possible. I think the next thing we were obviously focused about, you know, probably the most important one was really breaking up our investing into kind of defense and offense. And from a portfolio management perspective and looking after our existing assets, really getting on the defense and understanding what were the challenges, what we needed to do to manage them and ensure the continued performance. I think paramount to us was really the health and safety of our employees. This was at a period of time when the lockdowns broke that it was really unclear at the time how much the pandemic would impact people, what the health effects were. And for us, it was really putting in place measures and spending capital wherever needed to really ensure the protection and safety of those employees. From an asset perspective, it was also really defense around things like liquidity, drawing down revolvers where we needed to, just given the uncertainty in the markets and really making sure we were scrubbing our assets, working with our portfolio companies to do business continuity planning, shoring up the balance sheets and really just working with them to ensure they would continue to perform through that turbulent period. I would say then, in addition to that, Polo's a firm which is somewhat contrarian in nature and we often see opportunities of dislocation as a great time to invest. And so from an offense perspective, our origination strategy was really looking, being proactive and targeting assets where you felt may have been impacted through valuations, may have liquidity challenges and really working to look for opportunities that could take advantage of the dislocation that was happening across a number of the subsectors. So it was a crazy year and a really good one in hindsight to test the asset class and really stress test how it would play out through that dislocation. So getting back to Apollo real quickly, of course, the asset manager has said in the market, it's raising its second infrastructure fund and it's already made investments in US Wind, a Maryland based offshore wind developer, Great Bay Renewables, a provider of renewable energy development capital and has made investments in parallel infrastructure, a wireless tower company. Telecom is our next topic of discussion here. 2020 was defined with big deals and lots of evolving players in the digital infrastructure realm. The year kicked off with Digital Colony and EQT doing a take private of ASEO. Separately, EQT would acquire a data center under Edge Connects and then Digital Colony would then effectuate two massive recapitalizations in the data center space, which resulted in inflows of capital into two of its mature data center portfolios, Vantage and later Zcolo, which was originally part of Zio, while affiliates of Digital Colony would then retain a minority stake in operational control of the assets. That's a mouthful. So Dylan, just going back to trends in telecom, it feels like a little bit tired territory at this point, explaining what's driving it. We would be one of among a hundred webinars and podcasts explaining telecom trends right now. I wanna talk about what comes next. Given the increased competition for these telecom platforms, which effectively creates a potential for diminishing returns, can you tell us from your vantage point where the real opportunity lies for Apollo and Infrafunds pursuing telecom investments at this point? Yeah, look, I agree with you, John. It's been a topic everyone's talked about in the last 12 months. And in some ways it's kind of ironic because some of us that have been doing telecoms infrastructure for a while now had to explain why it was infrastructure just probably going back only four or five years ago. And it seems like the pendulum has completely swung the opposite way. I think with that, I would say you're right. It does feel like some of the new players in this space and some of the valuations that we've seen feel like that there could be a little bit of a bubble, frankly, in some of the deals that have been out there in the market. So it's something to kind of keep an eye on because ultimately you need to have that discipline and valuation, even if you are in a sub-sector which has exceptional growth behind it. If you're paying all that growth into an investment case, you're kind of really leaving yourself with downside risk. So I think that's a really good point. From our perspective, where do we see the opportunity? We continue to believe that we're in a period of time where the 5G rollout across the US will provide a lot of investment opportunity. I mean, ultimately all of the wireless connectivity that is needed to support a post-COVID social and business world is predicated on having hard assets that support them. But within that, we really see the best value being kind of the lower to mid-market. And the reason it's pretty simple is because we can buy platforms or acquire them like parallel infrastructure, which you mentioned, and deploy more success-based CapEx into them. And when you're doing that at a project level and directly putting that CapEx in yourself, you're kind of creating your own value and you're building your own platform up to a scale where you can sell that to the next buyer and create your own value rather than pay for that value. So for us, I think the platform play is really interesting. I think the 5G rollout in particular, fiber towers in a disciplined way, of course, all makes a ton of sense. I think there's a lot of other trends and opportunities more globally, but for us, we're sort of spending the immediate future really focusing on how we can deploy capital to support that kind of once in a generation build out here in North America. Are there certain geographies which could be the continued focus of capital inflows into the telecom sector? Anything you've observed about that trend, even if it's not your investment focus right now? I mean, look, we've observed it's happening across the globe. I think, as I mentioned, we're really focused around North America. We have a sort of more OECD developed market strategy around that and a platform strategy. But the capital inflows required across the world, pretty immense to kind of support that build out. If you think about some of the developed markets where we've seen recent investments and emerging markets, there's a lot of capital needed to support as populations grow and get more connected and economies change. You know, obviously from our perspective, emerging markets, there's immense opportunity, but they also come with additional risk, geopolitical, foreign exchange, sometimes some sovereign risk as well. So you want to make sure that you're getting compensated appropriately for the additional risk that you're taking, as opposed to just paying a developed market, you know, kind of price and return for that investment. But it's really exciting. I mean, the world is changing around us as we speak and communications is at the forefront of that. And we think there'll be capital inflows and opportunities across the globe, but we're tending to focus, as I mentioned, really more around plenty of wood to chop here in the US particularly. So just talking about, going back to my earlier question about telecom deals in 2020. And again, I talked through quite a bit, but, you know, there were others I didn't mention. And, you know, beyond that, there were a couple of interesting auctions that were going on almost private equity style through 2020 and 2019. You know, this speaks more to telecom and generally, in general, the infrastructure sector, I guess, so both sides of the equation. Do you believe all the bidding is irrational or is the ability to hit growth rates exist and why? Yeah, I mean, look, we've been in an interesting market with low yields for the last decade. And this question, you know, really has applied for the last kind of five to seven years. And it's interesting that in a post-COVID world, we really didn't see a runoff of valuations for a lot of assets. Maybe it was, I guess, the scarcity of some of the assets in terms of less sales being out there and, you know, the same amount of capital chasing them. So I do think you use the word irrational. I'm not sure I could sort of call it that because I guess everyone has their own mandate. I mean, we compete against, at times, people that, you know, aren't necessarily GPs. Maybe they're more direct investors that are looking for longer term yield or a more longer duration investment and can therefore rationalize a different price or strategics that can bid SGA, you know, takeouts. So, but I do think holistically, this continues to be, you know, for quality infrastructure assets, a seller's market and the high valuations around those sort of more quality core established assets will continue to persist regardless of COVID. I guess, you know, what does that mean for folks looking, you know, to kind of achieve growth infrastructure or more core plus? And for us, it's really just staying disciplined and, you know, looking for those smaller run-of-the-mill opportunities where you can capitalize on exceptional tailwinds behind you but be a little bit more creative in how you structure the investment or how you deploy the capital and how you support a business to actually achieve that growth rather than just kind of paying it all up front. You know, I think some of the techniques that we use here at Apollo within our sort of overall investment strategy is we like corporate carve-outs, for example. And they tend to be pretty complex transactions. You know, we executed on two last year where if you think about the seller, they're not necessarily another GP. They're a seller which is often looking for, there are other drivers behind the rationale to sell beyond just price and valuation. And so if you can work with them and provide execution certainty and help drive a corporate carve-out and transaction and in some cases be a good custodian of the assets because you have an ongoing relationship with them, that's a great way for us to kind of execute playbook and drive value for ourselves rather than just turning up at an auction, you know, and paying a premium price. We also sort of invest through what we call structured solutions. I think that's a little bit unique in the market because a lot of infrastructure funds are kind of delineated between, you know, a pure equity fund or a pure debt fund. Whilst our strategy continues to remain equity focused, we like the ability to do what we call structured solutions. So, you know, whether that's preferred equity, you know, kind of Mez, Holco, you know, putting in place earnouts in a deal, for example, to sort of protect ourselves. Ultimately, that structuring can sometimes be complex and can sometimes be simple, but it's really designed to protect the downside and to put in place some structuring where there may be a risk profile around an asset, maybe a greenfield asset, for example, and you want to structure around that risk and pass that risk along to someone who's better able to take that. So, yeah, I agree with you. I think there is definitely high valuations, but I still think there's a lot of tailwinds behind infrastructure and there's a lot of opportunity out there. You've just got to get out there and really have the origination hat on and look for them and have the ability to be flexible and creative in terms of how you structure and execute on the deals. So shifting over to transport, obviously in the US, the amount of investment activity in court transport really has declined quite rapidly, you know, in recent years. I think there were a lot of people that were looking forward, for instance, to a St. Louis airport privatization that never really manifested itself. And, you know, albeit there's a lot of activity at JFK today, it has its own set of unique challenges, the JFK International Airport, excuse me. But, you know, 2021 has opened the gates to some potentially new activity, new interesting activity. You know, plans have finally advanced in the Capital Beltway Managed Lanes Program where bidding's open for phase one of that project. Meanwhile, Georgia has unveiled a series of programs on the Greenfield side under the MMIP program, including most notably the SR400 project. Elsewhere in the M&A field, what really occupied a lot of transportation volume in recent years has been class two rail operators, most notably led by Brookfield, by now Geneseo in Wyoming, but it goes well below that in terms of quantity. So dealing with all that, let's talk about the incoming Biden administration and any tea leaves you're seeing that could lead to future investment opportunities in transport assets and what might drive that. Yeah, I guess firstly, you know, just on your points that you make around airport investing in rail. I mean, I guess, you know, if you think about 2020, demand-led transport assets like airports and, you know, in some cases toll roads and surface-based transport wasn't a great time to sell. And I think a lot of the owners of that were looking more around liquidity and just like shoring up balance sheets and kind of holding off. So it's probably not surprising that last year there was like less activity there and rail to some extent saw through the pandemic with some of the names that you mentioned. Also, I guess the Kansas City Southern opportunity that, you know, gathered a lot of press. So I think that's probably one of the reasons that drove more activity into rail. It was seen as relatively stable and predictable with less demand impact. I think your question on the Biden administration is a really good one. I think, you know, clearly every administration likes to talk about infrastructure and we've seen this, you know, for the last couple of decades here. And clearly if you go around the country you can see with your own eyes and, you know, you can just look at the under-investment that's happened in some of the really notable infrastructure, transportation, sub-sectors. And so that has a lot of good tea leaves as you put it behind it. I think to me, what's really interesting is obviously the Democrats control the House and the Senate now. And so, you know, theoretically there will be an opportunity really to kind of take advantage now for the first time in a decade and actually put in place some plans and try to implement them. If you look at, and I was just doing this actually a couple of hours ago with the transport secretary nomination, it's a good time that we talked. Some of the commentary that's come out, it's really favorable around investing into infrastructure as a whole, whether that's renewables, communications and also transportation. I think some of the things that are going to be required to support the broader programs will include more investment in, you know, high quality public transport infrastructure. That's something the Biden administration have talked about, which could be interesting as, you know, urban infrastructure looks for more investment. I think that, you know, one of the interesting things that was just spoken about in the nomination process just recently and a couple of hours ago was also EV and charging stations. And that's something that as an industry we've, you know, we've all acknowledged the opportunity and risk from the electrification of vehicles and the automation of it. But that's really a challenge that's really, really big. It's going to require, I've always thought, you know, some form of public private type partnership to solve that problem, as opposed to just the car manufacturers trying to do it themselves. So I think that that will present exceptional opportunity. And I guess just beyond that, there is going to be needed, you know, given how old and how deteriorated some of the highways, bridges, and just roads are across the US, just continued maintenance and replacement CapEx opportunities, which, you know, given the broader outlook for the economy should hopefully result in more private capital participation. I don't know how yet, and I don't know which method will be chosen, but I do think that there will be increased opportunity for private capital, you know, to support the improvement of some of these public assets. So look, overall, I think it's a really exciting time. I think infrastructure is one of those things, you know, politically it's great as well because it helps create jobs and just boost the economy. And both of those points, given where we are today, are really important. So we're really excited about it. And, you know, we're looking forward to participating in not just transport, but also, as I mentioned, the clean energy future, which has been spoken about a lot, as well as communications, which, you know, has a lot of tailwinds as well behind it from an administration perspective. Yes, and certainly to your point about the public-private partnership front for EV, we feel like some of it's in place already, but yeah, I mean, it's very limited from that standpoint, meaning there's definitely more room to grow in that area, such as an ongoing project we're covering now, which is the New York State Thruway rest stop project, which John Lang and Apple Green are sort of working to get up and running. Anyway, so just moving over to the energy space, where, you know, we hear the keyword decarbonization, clean energy, and those things you just mentioned about a second ago are all here. Obviously, there was a really sharp tail off in energy investment and in infrastructure in 2020, which really applies to midstream and midstream investments. Do you see any drivers surfacing again where there would be a newer investment push? You know, we hear from the market, you know, a lot of the midstream investments, you know, came up sort of as a direct result of almost transport investments going away. Obviously, these were contracted assets and there was a reason to put a lot of capital inflows into these type of investment dollars, but at the same breath, you know, as 2020 went on and the renewable push and decarbonization push came forward and also volatile oil prices, of course, I should not, I should have mentioned that first, combining all these things, it was just a down year in energy investments in general on some level. Are there any drivers do you think which would bring back a newer investment push in this arena, either for midstream or for LNG in terms of new investment? Yeah, look, this is an interesting point because obviously, you know, all of the tailwinds are behind decarbonization, which really kind of like from an infrastructure standpoint pushes towards lots of capital going into the renewable sector. I think, you know, we believe in the energy transition and we're supporters of it, but we also, we're realistic and I think it will take a long-term, you know, sort of secular shift to move more into that clean energy space and that will happen, but it will take time and clearly, you know, with the runoff of valuations last year in the midstream sector and, you know, the tide going out for a lot of people, that's probably pushed a lot of capital away from there, but I do think that, you know, as investors, your job is to really assess, you know, risk or reward and look for opportunities and ultimately midstream, you know, we'll still have a path to play up until a full clean energy shift. And with that path, there will be opportunities, we think on a very discreet and tactical basis to acquire some of these assets at valuations, which probably haven't existed in the last five years, just given the amount of capital and high multiples being paid for these. So I think for us, it's not a, you know, it's not something I want to sort of position as us actively charging into, but your job as an investor is really to look for opportunities on a risk reward basis. And we think that there will be some of those opportunities in midstream. Now, for us, one of the disciplines I think that was lost here and why people lost money is really the notion of contracted assets. And I'm glad you mentioned that because across the board, that's really where you found out which assets have performed well and which haven't. And I think for us, you know, we would continue using that discipline around contracted assets wherever possible in the midstream space, you know, in quality basins where we feel good about the long-term impact and obviously coming in on a much better valuation than a few years ago. So I think the short answer is there will be opportunities, but, you know, you clearly need to, with the way energy is moving longer term, make sure you value those right and get the right appropriate risk return mix. Okay, to close it out, a quick question on the new presidential administration. Obviously to your point earlier, it seems like infrastructure comes up every four years and with the previous presidential administration was a very hot button topic two years ago. What's your impression so far of the administration in terms of their, how it's gonna, and how they're gonna influence infrastructure going forward? I think I touched on some of this earlier. We have a really favorable impression. I think that the key point there is really the control of the House and Senate and ability to actually execute their plans. We've all seen, you know, the notion of billions and trillions of dollars mentioned over the past, you know, two decades by different administrations, but I really think some of the core principles of the campaign, the Democrats really play well to infrastructure and, you know, even things around social inequality that we've seen flows through to having better infrastructure to support certain economies and, you know, underprivileged areas, even things like, you know, public infrastructure, transport infrastructure to support that and communications infrastructure to bridge the digital divide. And there's some interesting things happening and being talked about around that to improve education quality and give people more of an equal footing. So we're really excited by it. We think it applies across the board. The most obvious one we just talked about is really renewables and the push there. But actually, if you think about it, infrastructure as a whole asset class will play a much bigger role and across transport, all the subsectors there, and even to some extent, possibly the education opportunities that you might see and health opportunities you might see in other markets where there's PPPs, that could be also an area where infrastructure starts playing a bigger role given the recent sort of devastating health effects that have happened in the last kind of 12 months. So very, very excited and looking forward to seeing some actual, you know, real tangible movement in this space. Great, Dylan. Well, that is all the time we have. So thank you, Dylan, for joining today's program. It was a really informative 30-minute discussion and we look forward to hearing from you next time. So with that, Berk out.

This is Abby Miller back at it again to host the pod, where this week we have Alan Marks, partner at Milbank and a reliable source on all things, infrastructure and project finance. Alan, welcome to the show. Hi Abby, thanks very much. As is customary this time of year, we're taking into account all that's happened within the past 12 months, good and bad, and looking ahead to 2021, what it might bring with the new Biden administration, vaccine rollout and how all of those things might impact the infrastructure world. So let's get into it. I know, Alan, that you mentioned before we started recording that being an attorney, there are some things that you can't get too detailed about. So if that happens, just let me know. And I thought I'd let our listeners know ahead of time. Okay, that's kind of you, I will. Great, yeah, so I will start out with how the market might be different next year, learning lessons that we learned, I guess, this past year with COVID-19. In terms of new Greenfield deals, do you think we'll see anything different that we haven't seen, or that maybe might either come to the market as a result of COVID or that authorities might push forward as a result of COVID, whether that be things like cold storage facilities for the Pfizer vaccine or airport cargo holds also for vaccine maintenance or for increased online shopping like we've seen so much this year? Yeah, it's a really good question. I'll start by saying certainly next year, 2021, I hope will be less volatile than 2020 was, but the shock of the pandemic, we had a lot of market dislocation and liquidity issues in public markets, certainly, and also in markets for certain debt instruments in the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter. We've kind of got through all that and financial markets have been pretty resilient. We're coming into a new administration. There will be new regulations. We can talk about the political climate later. We're still in a low interest rate environment and there's plenty of liquidity. So the question is, where will it go? Infrastructure is a very long-term asset class. I don't think that some of the intense investment that may be needed in logistics around cold storage for vaccines that you mentioned or other things dealing with the public health situation will really drive infrastructure investment. But I do think that because of kind of shifts that we've seen over the last year and going through the remainder of this pandemic situation as the public health situation gets cleaned up, I do think we'll see increased investment in some types of asset classes. So for example, long-term, there may be a shift in investment away from mobility, transit and transportation assets into what I'll call virtual mobility, which is basically digital infrastructure. And we're already seeing funds, strategics, corporates investing in data centers, in the fiber that connects them. And of course in energy, in particular renewable energy to service the tremendous energy demands of digital infrastructure. Yeah, definitely. That makes sense. And each year there are typically a few kind of big ticket projects in the US pipeline. Obviously some of those rollover, like we've been talking about the Capital Beltway Project for years on end now. But there also are usually a few that either reach financial close or get close to it and are seen as kind of the success of the year. Where do you think those might fall next year in terms of sector? Yeah, I think I'll look at sectors. First, given the kind of pleasantly surprising speed with which the vaccines have been able to be developed, we might see a recovery in air demand, air traffic demand and travel generally sooner than anticipated. We saw drop-offs of from 60 to 80% in air traffic volumes. Cargo actually remained pretty strong over some parts of this year. And a lot of airport project financings as a result and infrastructure concessions were put on hold. I've been working on JFK Terminal One and some of the projects at LAX and elsewhere. And I think we will see maybe an opportunity for a lot of those projects to come back. In the water sector, we could see a renewed commitment depending on federal policy under the Biden administration where you have a decreased investment in water treatment, water transportation, water supply, both for urban areas and also ex-urban or rural areas. We've talked about the impact of climate change and how there are certain projects which could be sped along to increase our resilience in the face of extreme weather events. So transmission projects on the power side could become more useful. Battery storage, certainly we're gonna see a lot more investments there. And mega projects which you asked about. So for example, the diversion project in Fargo, which recently benefited from some settlements of long-standing litigation. You know, that's been a major project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that could be done as a P3. That's right. Yeah, I was gonna ask about that a little later on, but yeah, obviously we covered the big news earlier this week. I don't remember exactly which day it was. About Fargo-Moorhead. I mean, do you think the end could actually be near on that one? I know it's been kind of in limbo for, I think potentially since before I even joined information back in 2018. Yeah, the end could be near for litigation and per bit uncertainty. Hopefully the beginning could be near for actually building something which will prevent floods in the area and will satisfy the stakeholders who had opposition. In fact, you know, in some cases legitimate opposition to some of the impacts that the original project, which has now been redesigned through the settlement would have had. Yeah, right. So switching over to the political climate, what do you think the Biden administration's kind of murky outlook on natural gas means for natural gas projects that have been pretty solid in the pipeline, both in the U.S. and elsewhere? You know, do you think we could see instead a shift to focus on like hydrogen fuel cells or things like that instead? I don't know that it's either or. You know, investments in hydrogen fuel cells in, you know, so-called green ammonia as a precursor to green hydrogen. You know, these are things which are long-term development prospects. You'll continue to see R&D public policy incentives and eventually I think also significant capital devoted to them. Natural gas is different. For starters, it's incumbent technology. It's also relatively inexpensive. And in fact, it's sort of a almost counterintuitive relationship between low-cost natural gas and the success we've had deploying solar and wind because those renewable resources are intermittent and have often therefore required, if you don't have a lot of battery storage yet, have required peaking plants, usually natural gas plants, to supplement them in order to make them penetrate the grid as quickly as they have. California recently extended the life of some of its gas-fired power plants in order to maintain grid stability and reserve margins when the sun sets and solar power stops producing. Wind can mitigate some of that. Hydro can mitigate some of that. But gas has been necessary, at least in the short and medium term, to meet that demand. So if gas is inexpensive, at the end of the day, that means that your reliable grid is less expensive to operate. As battery storage costs come down, that can displace gas, but that hasn't happened yet. Also, gas is global. And the repurposing of LNG import terminals to be re-gas facilities for natural gas exports from the U.S., the shift in LNG contracts in the Pacific to become a little more nimble, short-term spot markets like they are in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, I think you're gonna continue to see lots of LNG investment, especially in Asia, to fuel demand as to gas from Australia, from Malaysia, maybe Vietnam. Thailand finds its way up north to China and Japan and Korea, where there's a tremendous demand for imported gas that will only continue. So kind of going back to Fargo-Moorhead, since we're talking about the Biden administration and Fargo-Moorhead, obviously, is an environmental-related project and the Biden administration has signaled that they will, at the very least, try to pass a lot of pro-environment legislation to keep it simple. Do you think a Biden administration could advocate for other similar projects, either through the USACE or other authorities, for things like flood protection or other environmental goals? Yeah, I certainly do. I think you could see, under their administration's policies, an incentive for state and local governments to invest in projects that, first, prevent greenhouse gas emissions and things that contribute to climate change, second, for things that make existing infrastructure more resilient than the impacts of weather events, the rising sea levels, coastal erosion, aquifer contamination, extreme heat, which I mentioned before. You know, all of those things may demand help and you could see them encouraging that. Now, for private investors, the question then is what does that mean for opportunities to invest? Not clear to me yet, although they do certainly support P3s as part of the toolkit, it's not clear to me what the model will be to translate the desire to have public investments in resiliency projects and the opportunities for either risk-sharing, lifecycle cost reduction or availability payment-based concessions that would give an opportunity for private investors. I think we'll see. Most of that probably will be done with public monies or tax-exempt debt with government issuers would be my guess. And kind of rolling off of that, of course, we know that a lot of projects had to take some sort of federal regulation into consideration. You know, that's nothing new, but with the change in administration to one more, like I said, focused on things like greenhouse gas emission and infrastructure projects driven by that, I mean, do you think that we could see more federal intervention than normal or do you think it'll probably stay more like it is? I guess I'm thinking about things like the EPA or even the CDC getting involved in some deals. Yeah, I think it's an interesting question. And the first thing I think you'll see is a reduction in friction where they can that allows for the government's incentives toward investment to be more effective. So for instance, you may have noticed during the end of the campaign season that Joe Biden was pretty clear he's not jumping on the Green New Deal bandwagon. He took a lot of flak from the far left of his own party because of that. By the same token, I think, you know, ending subsidies for oil and gas or protections that they have for liability shields, you know, fracking was a very complicated issue for him politically, especially in Pennsylvania. But I think what you're gonna start to see is regulatory clarity. So, and that may depend too on what happens at the Senate. If he's lucky enough to pick up a couple Democratic senators from Georgia, you have a Democratic Senate and House, you will see, I think, a bigger push legislatively. If that doesn't happen, if one or both of the Republican incumbent senators from Georgia is reelected and Mitch McConnell is still running the Senate, then I think you will see two things happen. One, a need for compromise and bipartisanship. I worked on Capitol Hill over 30 years ago. That used to exist. It could exist again, although most people don't expect that to happen. The other is executive orders and administrative policies. And that's where you have to look at the federal agencies. So staffing agencies fully, having the rulemaking process with, you know, the typical transparency that's required coming through the agencies, executive orders from the White House and guidance from the White House to the agencies on how to enforce existing laws, environmental laws in particular, without creating bottlenecks for implementation of large projects. I think that's what you're gonna start to see. So it'll, regardless of politics, what you'll start to see, I think, is more predictability in public policy. Okay, so shifting away from politics and just back to a little bit more recent news, I'm not sure how much you can comment on this one, but I'm sure yesterday, I guess Wednesday and Thursday of this week, we saw the news about Transurban selling 50% of their assets in the greater Washington area. Do you think others, particularly toll road operators, could follow suit with more secondary transactions to come in the next year? Yes, I definitely do. And, you know, if you divide the market up, greenfield development of new projects, that's not where all the action is at the moment in the infrastructure space, especially outside of energy. Renewable energy, obviously, is still, we have a lot of new build, but deals like the Transurban sale of its, you know, DC and Virginia-based roads, that's the kind of a transaction I think we're gonna see a lot more of. I'm working quite a bit with, both on the buy side and the sell side, on transactions now that are really either asset or corporate M&A deals more than they are new build because there are infrastructure funds and private equity funds that need to deploy capital. They have ample liquidity looking for a place to go and to be deployed and only limited time to do it. Valuations have become a little more attractive, I think, because of low interest rates and a perception that risk is not that great as we've discovered how resilient these cash flows can be in a recessionary environment. You know, demand is significantly lower, I mentioned, for air travel or hotels, but demand for water is the same. You know, the ability of governments to pay availability payments remains still kind of unconstrained, notwithstanding the challenges that they have on tax collections, you know, because of the recession. So I would expect that you'll see a lot more secondary activity. It's gonna differ by sector too. So, you know, this year already in 2020, brownfield deals were probably twice the volume of greenfield deals. In renewables, we saw, you know, probably more comparable numbers, maybe still more greenfield deals slightly. Transportation, again, by dollar amounts, slightly more brownfield than greenfield. And then refinancings took up the bulk of the rest of that, where basically longer term debt, cheaper price debt because of low interest rates, or extraction of value by refinancing and letting equity take some money off the table to redeploy in these other deals, the M&A deals I talked about. That's kind of what we're, I think, gonna see more of in 2021. Yeah, that's great. And definitely, I guess what I had a feeling what you would say. Abby, one other thing I'd mentioned, where we really see the most secondary market activity in contrast to the percentage of capital that's going into new build is digital infrastructure and telecom. So that's a trend that might change. That's one where you will still, I think, see the secondary market activity, you know, acquisitions of data centers, acquisitions of cell phone tower networks and the wireless backhaul that goes with it. Longer term going forward, as you find more companies with displaced labor that still works from home, even a year or two from now, schools shifting to distance learning sometimes on a, you know, for, I think the partial shift will continue. And most importantly, the rollout of 5G. 5G is going to require massive investment in telecom and in the power to provide the 5G functionality. So we'll probably see a significant increase in new build or greenfield investment on the digital side. Yeah, definitely. So just to wrap things up, what do you think is the most important thing to keep in mind instead of looking ahead to the 2021 market? Looking forward, I'd say probably the larger macroeconomic picture will be the most important. Low interest rate environment is probably going to continue. Long-term demand is probably still going to be forecasted to be strong. And that will, both those things will help valuation. And in the near term, I think we'll see recovery of demand in the parts of the markets that have, infrastructure markets that have been hit the most by the pandemic and the recession. So that coupled with greater regulatory certainty would be, I think, all to the good. Yeah, yeah, I agree. And I certainly hope that's what we see. It's definitely encouraging to see the photos of people starting to get vaccines and hope that maybe some sort of end is somewhat near. Okay, yeah, well, thank you so much, Alan, for taking the time out of your busy schedule to join us this week. Absolutely, my pleasure. Thank you very much. Yeah, and to all listeners, have a lovely and relaxing holiday. We'll be back in January. Bye.

We're here to provide you the latest information on infrastructure transactions in the Americas. I'm joined today by two guests. We're speaking with Juan Pareda, our head of research, who will be discussing lead tables for the full year 2020. And I'm also joined by Alejandro Paredes from Shuman & Sterling, who will be discussing a little bit of how the year was last year and what we have to look forward to in 2021. Everybody knows that the pandemic has had a severe impact on Latin America and made doing business very challenging in the region during 2020. We've had a look at some of the data and we're almost ready to produce our lead table report for the full year. And so here's Juan Pareda to discuss a little bit about what we've seen and what the lead tables will show us about activity in the infrastructure and energy space in the region. Hi, Juan. How are you? Hi, Jonathan. Thank you for having me here. Juan, you've been compiling the data, you've been receiving submissions for the lead tables. We almost have the full field counts and all of the results. We're not going to reveal the winners on this show, but perhaps we could talk a little bit about some of the numbers that we're seeing at this early stage. In terms of the numbers of deals that have closed, from what I've seen from preliminary numbers, we're around about where we were in 2018, a little bit down from 2019. How do you see those numbers? Well, yes, that is correct. We're not, from a Latin America perspective, both excluding Brazil and including Brazil, we are doing roughly the same or even better than 2018. That's the trend we're seeing and probably is going to be confirmed, probably is going to be even better, quite better than 2018. Still not getting to 2019, both in deal count and deal value. 2019 was a record year for Latin American excluding Brazil and deal value is going to be roughly there and significantly better than 2018. But for Brazil, there is a huge drop. There are many things that explain this that we can talk about, but basically we are seeing this. It's something we were expecting, but again, it's not as bad as you could have thought with COVID. There are many reasons about that and definitely projects kept being funded all across the region, energy and infrastructure project, both seem to be quite active in 2020. I think one of the things that we've seen from the notable deals that appear on the lead tables is the size of some of the mega transactions that did close during the year, which shows that there's certainly still a healthy appetite for assets, performing assets, and especially regulated assets in Latin America. I'm thinking about some of the Sempra sales of things like Ruz del Sur in Peru and Chirquinta in Chile. If you put alongside that the RCO, Red de Carreteras de Occidente sale from Goldman Sachs in Mexico and the other Mexican transport deal, which saw CPPIB and OTPB acquiring a stake in Ideal. Those are multi-billion dollar deals, and that's certainly helped to bring up the deal value, hasn't it? For sure. I mean, we had some deals. This is also how infrastructure works. Maybe we have a lag on the impact of COVID, at least for 2020, and many of these deals were already agreed before. RCO, as you mentioned, is a very massive highway deal in Mexico that was already agreed last year. Chirquinta and Ruz del Sur, both big utilities, Peru and Chile, agreed last year. So all these projects were already agreed but reached financial close in this year. So for lead table purposes, it will enter into this year. For next year, yes, there are a couple of deals that are pending to close that are already agreed, but we don't see that many. And I think the impact of slow procurement in 2020 and 2019 is going to start to show probably in the next couple of years. We don't have that many greenfield activity, at least in the pipeline, and that is also something we can see in the data. Another thing, you were talking about notable deals. Yes, we have some interesting deals, but in previous years, we used to have one deal that was the landmark deal, and that was usually a Brazilian project. For instance, in 2019, we had the TAG sale, the Transportadora Social de Gas, which was a massive $8.7 billion privatization project that was a notable deal, both for the region and globally. This year, we're not seeing any project of the Latin American deals to enter into a threshold of top 10 deals by value in the world. And that shows that probably, I think this shows that the privatization process in Brazil were not as relevant as we maybe would have expected a couple of years ago. But still, I mean, there are some deals, like we were talking about those deals that are still important, the M&As we were talking about, but still not from a global perspective. It's not, maybe we don't have that landmark deal. And I think that's probably what impacted the global numbers in general, as of deal value that we're seeing compared, for instance, with 2019 or even 2020. So we've seen the number of greenfield PPPs falling since 2017, when we saw 27 deals closed worth around $10 billion. In 2020, that number fell to around 16 deals worth almost $5 billion. Juan, do you see that there's been a change in the types of deals that have been closing in terms of more M&A deals versus greenfield deals? Yes, for sure. I mean, M&As is something we are seeing that it has been quite active. We have already talked about big M&A deals. Also refinancing. The refinancing market has been quite active, especially on some markets, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, all those who have some kind of refinancing activity, even Mexico. But not so much in greenfield. Obviously, we always say the same thing. To have a greenfield project be funded, we need projects. So if the pipeline of projects is not fitting the market, that is something that there's nothing the market can do itself. I mean, if the government of Mexico says not to tender much PPPs, okay, that's something the market is going to have an impact on. Our data is going to reflect that. I honestly think that we haven't seen the worst yet. And this is because also Chile has slowed down its procurement, even though it backed up a little bit in 2020, but it has significantly slowed down the procurement under the new government while they were settling things up. And Argentina didn't end up doing a successful PPP program. Uruguay is already almost capped on the amount of PPPs they can tender. Peru has not picked up on the procurement side. So we're not seeing any kind of PPP projects moving forward. However, that being said, we have to admit that as a percentage of projects, transport is more relevant in Latin America than as a global perspective. Energy is more relevant, energy power renewables, even though it's quite relevant in LATAM. As a global number, it's more relevant there. So we're still a transport-based, I mean, even though it's not the most significant one, these deals are still showing up there. And I think that this is because we still have these M&As that are quite relevant, right? Airports, but especially roads, we're seeing a lot of roads being sold and refinanced. And I think that's something, that's why we have a slightly higher in comparison number of transport deals to the entire world. Excellent. Juan, thank you very much. I'll let you go to finish off compiling the data and we look forward to seeing that report published next week. Thank you. Hopefully next week for sure. I'd like to bring in then Alejandro Padres from Sherman and Sterling. Alejandro, thanks for coming on the program. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. Alejandro, Sherman and Sterling performed very well. I think we'll see you guys quite high up the league tables for 2020. And you worked on some very significant deals, RCO, Cometa and Savi Financings in Mexico, and the AES Panama Generation Holco refinancing as well. How was the year for Sherman and Sterling and how did you adapt to the new reality in Latin America? Well, it was definitely an interesting year, not a year without its challenges, of course. We're quite happy at what we've accomplished within the sort of confines of the COVID-19 pandemic and the havoc it has wrought throughout the world, and particularly in Latin America. But as you noted, we were involved in some significant transactions that were in the market, Mexico, Central America, and South America. And I think that's a testament to a couple of things. One, the strength of the financiers and the developers that wanted to get projects or transactions off the ground from M&A and refinancing to financings outright, to the teams that were assembled and were able to, I would say, nimbly accomplish all of that from the comfort or discomfort, in some cases, of their own homes. So that, I think, it's been a positive year for the firm, for our group, and we are excited for what 2021 has in store for us. I think, memorably, the RCO transaction was one of those that had taken some time to get off the ground initially several years back, and our clients are, I think, excited to pursue this in earnest. And we were happy to be able to assist them in doing so, not just signing, as indicated last year, but then achieving the closing as well. As for challenges, it was, in terms of adapting, I think COVID took the world by surprise, and I'm quite impressed by how our, not just the legal industry, but also everybody involved in the infrastructure industry, if you will, at large, was so adept at adjusting to the new reality and maintaining a semblance of continuity in transactions and in development of projects throughout the region. Excellent. And in terms of the deals that got closed, I wonder if there's anything you noticed about which deals closed and maybe which deals took longer or are going to drag over into 2021. Was there any trend there in what perhaps lenders had more appetite for financing and what they were perhaps more cautious towards financing? Yeah. My impression is that when it came to the liquidity financings or transactions, when it came to refinancings and reprofilings, those, I think, were met with greater attention because of the pressing nature of the underlying circumstances. So trying to ensure no defaults, no cross defaults and things of that nature was, I think, paramount for both lenders and for corporates throughout the region. I think that early on in the pandemic, together with understanding supply chain logistics and the impact of supply chain logistics throughout the construction industry was of note. In particular, understanding the concentrated geographic risk of suppliers or service providers and how that can be detrimental to projects in the early stages or in the construction phase. So I think that was something worth highlighting. In terms of what got held up, I think, as Juan was noting, M&A transactions, although several did successfully close, several remained in process because the pandemic has had some consequences to the ability of the parties to not just consummate, but also to diligence review and find comfort with whatever the financial indicators are for the underlying business. So I think by an industry basis, you may see as well a little bit of skewing, hospitality versus renewables. So I think that those are the deals that I think have probably been more susceptible of delay. And then Greenfield projects that are just starting out, I think there we've seen on both sides of the equation, both the financiers and the developers, not reevaluate, but be more considerate in evaluating when to go to market, all within the constraints of concessions and milestones that need to be met under their contractual arrangements. So I think we've seen a little bit of everything, honestly. Okay. I think it's a very interesting point where you mentioned about maybe the hospitality industry. A lot of countries in Latin America certainly depend heavily on tourism as a source of revenue. Places like Mexico, places like the Caribbean in particular. We've seen Mexico and I'm thinking particularly of Cancun, proposing tourist bridges to link the resorts in Cancun to the city and the mainland. Those kinds of projects and a lot of other transportation projects, especially in the airport sector, they will have had a real problem in, as you said, performing due diligence and projections to try and estimate what kind of revenues they'll be having in the future. While we're advancing towards a vaccine and hopefully life at the end of the tunnel in terms of the pandemic, it's still very difficult to stay with any kind of surety what time and when the pandemic will end and we'll be able to go back to our normal behaviour. So I'm sure that's going to be an issue for projects in the future, whether that's the kind of projects that people have already tendered and are looking to finance or whether that's projects that perhaps are on the horizon in people's portfolios. I think that's accurate. I think that the reality is anybody invested in these industries is looking at the longer-term fundamentals, not the short-term realities. Adversity is a trigger for creativity and that's what we're seeing across the board, creative solutions. In terms of the energy markets and especially thinking of renewables here, a lot of those projects were very necessary for a long time. Energy consumption dipped significantly during the pandemic and remains lower than at previous levels. But how do you see that industry changing? We're also seeing a kind of technological shift as a lot of the oil majors start to declare that they want to invest more in renewable technology there's the dawn of a lot of storage capacity being added to renewable projects and other generation facilities and there's also the dawn of perhaps green hydro as a source of energy for some countries. Do you see that that change much in 2020 and there's perhaps prospects of different kinds of deals we might see in 2021? Yeah, definitely. I think that it may not be that we see deals closing in 2021 in these technology sectors, if you will, or subsectors, but I think that there is greater interest in pursuing them. I mean, Chile stands out as one of the countries that is focusing on green hydrogen and projects are starting to be pursued I think with more fervor and so one would expect those to be part of a more mainstream conversation in 2021. It is unclear to me whether or not any of those projects are at a stage that would likely achieve a financial close in 2021, not due to COVID reasons, but more because it is sort of incipient in the region. With storage, I think same thing, there's been experimental usage of storage in some countries and Chile comes to mind, but not at a sort of widespread level. We've seen more battery storage, I think in the US than in Latin America and that's not to say that it won't gain traction. I think it will. I think there are just simply logistical and infrastructure demands that necessitate the implementation of those technologies. It's just, I think it's on the brink of the horizon, if that makes any sense. The one area where I'm starting to, we've had a couple of conversations with some of the private equity firms is biomass, right? They're looking at biomass and wondering when is that going to be further developed in Latin and what is there available? The reality is that's another area that is still sort of in early stages and there's been episodic development of biomass, but not in a way that is fully embraced in the way that the more traditional renewables have, solar and wind in the region. If we look back, solar and wind have only really been part of the discussion in Latin America and more or less the last 10 years, maybe 12, but before that it was really just experimental at best. I think that we are on the brink of the horizon to start seeing these be part and parcel of more mainstream conversations and we'll start seeing projects being sort of brought to market early stages for socialization, if you will. Okay. That leads on to another interesting point and we're starting to see mentions of potentially offshore wind projects in Latin America, in Brazil and most recently as well in Colombia. I'm curious to see if that will continue a trend this year as well. You talked about the kind of the moment in terms of the development of projects and especially in renewables. They've come a long way in Latin America. Chile is certainly a global leader in terms of the implementation of renewables projects. As the market matures, as the original equity investors look perhaps for an exit for their portfolios, we are seeing a lot of new investors coming into the market as well. A lot of Chinese money is coming in, trying to find project portfolios and a lot of Europeans and Americans as well have been trying to buy projects and portfolios in the region. I'm wondering if you see anything changing in that sense in terms of the stage we're at with the development of those technologies and the types of investors who will perhaps be looking for an exit and also looking to come into the market to acquire ready made projects. I think it's a natural progression of any market and I think we saw that. My career started in Mexico with the CFP independent power producer program and the first generation or iteration I should say of that program was the Greenfield investment in financing. Then came the equity investments to strategic partners. Then came the sale of assets, refinancings in between and the like. I think that the renewable sector in Latin America has officially reached that level of maturity if you will where it's become, I don't want to say commodity, but it's become an asset, a tradable asset if you will. We have seen investments from the Chinese as you indicated, they've picked up the Zuma assets and that was a remarkable transaction. It's an indicator of a geographic interest if you will of Chinese investors in the renewable sectors. They've been traditionally APC contractors and suppliers for panels in Mexico. This indicates to me that next level of progression. We do see them involved throughout the region and looking for opportunities. I think that that will continue. We've personally been involved in the sale of equity stakes to strategic investors for portfolios of renewables projects in the region. The portfolio or portfolioization if you will of renewables also speaks to the ever-thinning margins in that sector of the power industry. It sort of parcels up these multiple projects and prepares them quite nicely I think for strategic equity investors down the line. One final question if you'll allow it. We obviously saw a lot of activity in Mexico in the past. The current government has now been there for several years and they initially were a little bit wary of private investment. They weren't particularly fans of the kind of profits they saw private companies making through infrastructure. At the end of last year we did see the government coming forward and discussing efforts that it had made alongside the private sector to move forward certain projects which would require private investment. Now if we parallel that with Brazil where there seems to be an absolute just fire sale of so many of the government's assets under the PPIA program alongside numerous large-scale opportunities in the transportation sector and other sectors beyond that. Do you see Brazil continuing that trajectory to do much more business and Mexico perhaps coming back or do you see Mexico still being a little bit reluctant to engage with private investors for infrastructure projects? Yeah I think that's a great question. It's a difficult one to answer. I will tell you on the Mexico side you know it's unclear given the current administration's view generally and the fact that there's still some time to go before this administration leaves office that indicates to me that change is probably not going to be as immediate as we would like it but I do think it will be inevitable. And by inevitable and I'm speaking specifically in the power industry the fact that the Mexican courts have pronounced themselves quite firmly against some of the measures that have been taken and rules and regulations that have been promulgated by the AMLO administration is a good indicator right of the sort of pro-business environment that the courts believe Mexico has but they are going cross-current with an administration that has a different view for a variety of reasons and I think they're well known in the market. So I think it's the sort of the contrast of those two forces that'll give us the result and it's unclear as of yet where we'll end up. I personally think that we will overcome this more limited view of a private industry in Mexico and have to reconcile the fact that there is a need to cooperate and collaborate and hopefully that will prevail over you know the personal views of the administration when it comes to private industry. With respect to Brazil I think it's equally as complex but maybe for somewhat different reasons which is you know this fire sale that you mentioned I think is driven in large part due to one the need for liquidity at you know as a fiscal matter and then two you know the unwieldy efforts required to administer these assets and I say that only because I think that this presents an opportunity for the sales, it presents an opportunity for the Brazilian government to kill two birds with one stone right. It's shored up its finances while at the same time offloading the administration of you know these complex networks of pipelines and other assets and the issue is driven in part because I think you know fiscally the country is a little bit in trouble. Their last check I think they were at a debt to GDP ratio sort of around 90% which is extremely high. I think it's extremely high you know globally and that you know presents problems right and if they don't shore up those public finances quickly there's going to be you know a problem when it comes to IMF and other organizations and investors. So I think that's what's driven it and I would expect that there would be some more of that to come. That's a good way to end the conversation as well I think you know Colombia has made some mention of possible privatizations this year. We've thought about companies like ISA, Conexion Electrica and their enormous business internationally in both the transportation and the electricity sector. So that's going to be interesting to see if that plays out as well as they seek to fill their fiscal deficit. Alejandro, thank you so much for coming on the show. Juan, thank you so much for your participation. Thanks everyone for listening and we look forward to seeing you on the next edition of the Crossroads Podcast.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-12-15 14:05:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Infrastructure forecasts ahead of the incoming Biden administration\n**Episode ID:** 4433\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the latest edition of the Crossroads podcast. I'm John Burke, America's Editor for Information. Joining me today is Judah Gluckman, Principal Consultant of US Advisory Services for WSP and Vice President of the Young Professionals in Infrastructure. And then we have Jeremy Eby and Jed Friedlander, both managing partners in the Phoenix Infrastructure Group. And finally, my colleague, Andrew Vitelli, just added to the crowded house today. Thanks for joining the program today, gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. We are headed for a very interesting first 100 days of the Biden administration, which is now, I guess, starting in 40 days time, in which we are looking for a focus, hopefully, on a coordinated strategy to combat COVID, more economic stimulus. And behind that economic stimulus, perhaps, preparations for an infrastructure bill. So Jed, just to kick it off, wanted to get your thoughts about where you see the Biden administration coming in on infrastructure policy and how that might change once the new administration comes in. Sure. So Jeremy and I actually have been interacting regularly with the infrastructure, Biden's infrastructure policy team. I think we came away from that really focusing on four key areas of the Biden Build Back Better plan that relate to our space to infrastructure. First, and we can talk about them all a bit after letting them out, the first one is domestic manufacturing and innovation, pushing that forward. Second is sustainable, clean infrastructure. Third is workforce education. And fourth is racial equity. So those are the four key areas of advancement. I think the way that we think about it, on the first prong, domestic manufacturing and innovation, the innovation we've all seen, obviously, a lot of innovation during COVID. Throughout the economy, we haven't really seen it so much filter through to P3, to infrastructure. But I think we will going forward. The domestic manufacturing is interesting. I mean, not that anyone was thinking that we would do away with the Buy American Act, but Trump actually signed an executive order that increased some of the requirements there, particularly for iron and steel components, that the actual component parts of iron and steel and products need to be now 95% US origin versus 50%. So I think it will be interesting for some of these larger transportation and infrastructure projects to see if that order stands or is ultimately replaced, because that will have a material impact on the cost of infrastructure. I think the second prong, sustainable, clean infrastructure, we also read that to include resilience, which is really becoming a key topic in a lot of infrastructure. We're thinking about how to fund that, how to finance it. It doesn't have an independent revenue stream. So I think that will be key, an increased push on clean infrastructure. The third and fourth, workforce education and then racial equity is an area that, at Phoenix, we spend a lot of time thinking about. We're working on a white paper now with some of our colleagues at AIAI, one of the industry groups. We interpret, really, this push as translating into a serious commitment to partnership, not just participation at every level of infrastructure delivery. So talking about development, design, construction, finance, operations, partnership with minority disadvantaged groups in those key delivery modes for a project. And I think that that really dovetails well with the idea of workforce education, where these projects can really create an impact, create opportunities for local and disadvantaged groups to improve their level of sophistication and get more involved in some of these infrastructure projects. That's kind of where we're focusing and anticipating things are going to go. So to jump in, do you see a Biden administration as being overall supportive of public-private partnerships? Because I remember when his infra plan was released over the summer, there was some concern that P3s were somewhat left out of the equation. I guess I'll handle that one, Jed, if you don't mind. This is Jeremy Eby. I think that they are seen as part of the mix. I think that you do have definitely a view that the priorities that Jed mentioned, getting those however you can in the best way and the most likable way forward is the best way to go about it. I think that on the state and local level, obviously, the acceptance of P3 has been pretty broad and pretty much, I won't call it unanimous, but it's getting standardized every day. I don't think that the administration is against P3s. I definitely do not think that. I think that they realize, though, that however they can, this is one of the toolboxes and that this is a means to get to the real end, which are kind of those four points that Jed mentioned previously. But I don't want to speak for them directly, but in my engagement with them, that's the perspective that I've gotten. This is Jed. If I could just add a couple of points to that, I agree. I think to add to it, it sort of depends what happens on the Hill, right? And obviously, we've got a runoff campaign in Georgia that will kind of dictate the majority in the Senate and that will have a big impact on just what the potential is for a large stimulus bill, a large infrastructure bill. But either way, I think they're going to be looking in the background or what are the executive actions that can be taken that support that. And it's become pretty clear to me in my conversations with folks on the transition that the quick sort of moves are things that providing technical capacity and supporting and encouraging states and cities to consider these new tools, because particularly if there isn't new funding on the congressional side, you really are going to have to be creative and use more of these P3 solutions. OK, and we'll roll back to that in a second. But let's talk about what's going on in states and municipalities today. I mean, there's obviously a fiscal crisis in certain jurisdictions, such as Chicago. Sorry, Jeremy, but it is what it is. And then there's obviously some concern about if P3 projects get launched, not ones that are funded already, of course. We have to make that distinction. How are they going to get funded? Is there going to be a greater shift into the private sector? Or will the tax-exempt market also still continue to be a viable funding source? We've already seen two P3-linked bond deals get very favorable pricing in the past few weeks. And we're going to probably see the results of a third one probably coming up this week or next week. So what do you got? Judah, I think you wanted to take this one. What's your thoughts on the public versus private sector risk for projects in the pipeline? Yeah, so I mean, I think for all the reasons Jeremy stated earlier, both are going to be important, viable tools to delivering infrastructure. Obviously, with COVID having a pretty dramatic effect on revenue for cities and states, they are having to be more creative. And that necessity really is the mother of invention. So I think we will see more reliance on P3s, but P3s that are paired with ultimately finding new funding, finding new revenue. So different forms of value capture that say, we've got this underutilized asset that maybe has some private commercial potential, creating new energy that may have a value, finding other efficiencies. It's those kinds of projects that I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of, whether they're using tax-exempt or private financing. Yeah, one of those deals, of course, was issued by Georgia, the Garvey bonds. They were able to raise $400 million-plus. And it priced yesterday. And they did allocate a sliver, I think $100 billion or so, towards the SR-400, which will be a prominent availability payment-based P3, where you're supposed to get a proponent status probably by the middle of next year, if not a little bit later. But that was a Georgia DOT ahead-of-the-curve kind of bond offering. And he kind of wondered if there's more that's going to come out of GDOT, since they do have six projects they're currently contemplating under that MMIP program that they've prepared. And also, there's always the thought that there's going to be another broadband project also in the pipeline from them. So they're going to have probably a busy 2021 and 2022 for themselves. So let's shift to one of those funding sources, which is private activity bonds. With bonds issued and those allocated out of the program, so they are running up against the cap, wanted to know if you guys are getting any hints out of Washington, particularly with the Maryland Mads Lane project on the horizon of there being a new deal to be had, if there's going to be an uplift on the cap of some sort. So Judah, Jed, I'm not sure if we want to take this one. But you go ahead. Yeah, I can take a first crack. And others can feel free to chime in. I mean, I think if any kind of transportation bill happens, then there's an extension or an increase of the cap on PABs. And TIFIA, WIFIA, they've seen recent increases as well, similarly, for that reason. They are just proven successful tools to make projects happen. They're certainly not the sole financing source that happens in almost any of their projects. They can't be. But they get projects done. They bring costs down and make them possible. And I think they have bipartisan support for that reason. And we'll continue to see that happen. And there's been really strong advocacy, not just from our industry, but really people across the sort of infrastructure spectrum. So I think we absolutely have to keep an eye on it. But I think it'll be increased as needed. Yeah, I'll back Judah on that. The number one thing is that two things to note is that there is broad support across the aisle and across industries, P3, as well as your traditional bond financing for increasing PABs at every juncture in which it's kind of increasing the PAB limit every time that it's kind of hit that or gotten close to that limit. When you look at the latest projects that have been allocated for this past year, and those are some very good ones, the one I thought you were going to mention, John, was Prince George's County Schools, which I believe got priced, the activity that there is definitely, every time it's kind of come up for increasing the limit, it has gone there. And I think that when you look at no matter what the infrastructure stimulus bill or whatever it ends up being will be, PABs will be definitely on the menu because of the optionality that they provide in financing projects. And if you take a look at, and you can find this on the USDOT website, you'll see just the variety of projects that they've gotten into that they've been involved in. I'm just remembering street lighting, DC street lighting is on there, and Prince George's County also involved, as well as you mentioned Fargo, Moorhead, and a few other projects that are just a variety of projects related there. So my point is that that program is pretty much standardized and pretty much set in its value add to bringing forward projects. So expect to see that continue. Yeah, I guess I'd add, I think you'll see some creativity here. I mean, I think we're seeing hits to local, state, local, and federal coffers. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see Build America bonds being discussed again. We've already seen infrastructure projects, P3 projects, developers being asked to incorporate land value, real estate value, development rights in certain projects. I'm thinking in particular of some of the rail projects in Florida, some of the Brightline projects. But there's certainly, in social infrastructure, you see that pretty frequently as well. I would expect to see more creativity there, more ways to pull in additional value into a P3 structure. So going into the P3 market, what particular sectors do you think will be highly relevant in 2021, and why is that? Jude, I think before the podcast, we talked about your interest in water and water projects. So why don't you go outline that a little bit for us? Yeah, sure, thanks. I mean, I think WSP, we advise a ton of water authorities from across the country, really the entire world. But our focus, my immediate focus, is North America. And across the board, those entities are looking. I mean, they have huge needs, and it's harder and harder to find the funding and resources locally in their own budgets. So they're having to be creative, be resourceful. And so you're seeing actually not just drinking water and wastewater and those sort of key projects that are fundamental to what they do, but they're looking outside the box a little and finding things like energy creation, using new technologies like anaerobic digestion, thermal energy from the waste in their pipes and the heat that that creates, even to the point of selling fertilizer that they create from their waste. So they are finding as many new tools and funding solutions that sort of offset their costs and help them deliver what they need to. And in the process, it helps them avoid raising rates on their taxpayers, their residents, their citizens. So it's a lot more politically palatable as well. And those are the kinds of projects that are, in some ways, really ideally suited to P3s, because it's not part of the water authority's core fundamental business that they don't want to let go of, that they don't feel the need to max out their control on. And there are also new technologies and new sort of whole lifecycle projects that involve not just the design and construction, but operations and maintenance as well, and can be kind of standalone, one-off projects. So they're really, really important, have great potential, but even ideally suited to a P3 for all those reasons. Yeah, as usual with infrastructure, Canon is leading the way so far as being the predicate of exactly what you talked about. You have Halifax just awarding their organics project. Edmonton probably awarding theirs next year. I believe we have a project in Ontario as well. They're just busy, busy up there. In the US so far, we've seen Lake Oswego, right, as advancing probably into 2021. And Santa Clara had a sort of a water project, I guess they were an RFI in the spring, which we heard might be going, advancing soon. Anyway, so it's certainly a busy space. And certainly I think hopefully some of these provincial projects will rub off on some more activity in the States at some point. So Jed, moving over to the university space where we've been busy writing about it. And most of the P3 community has been invested in these projects as a result, not from us, of course, but from the public interest, you have universities with 200 to 300 year old history, very ancient energy systems. Some of these bigger state schools with state renewable initiatives. It's kind of a no brainer at a certain point where you think, oh, an uplift's needed, we need to change the way we do business. And plus, as often in infrastructure, you guys talk about, well, what's core to what people do and what's non-core to what they do. And universities don't do energy, they do education. Do they run power facilities? Yes, because they have to, but this is where there's an infrastructure, there's a P3 project on the horizon. We've seen a lot of this as of late. Jed, we were talking about universities, but then also maybe extending to the concept of district energy, which is what we're talking about here with universities and district energy also moving to maybe municipalities as well. So Jed, why don't you expound on that a little bit? And also if you could maybe talk a little bit about how public and private universities are approaching these projects as well, that'd be interesting to hear. Yeah, happy to. The district energy space is one we've been following for really 20 years. And I think there was an initial wave of these almost 20 years ago, and everybody anticipated there'd be a lot more, but that's really only recently started. And the deals that you're really seeing get done in the market are, there's a monetization component to it. So I think looking forward, we're all talking about the budget impact of COVID. Universities are feeling that just as much as municipalities. One way that the universities I think will continue to look to fill those gaps is by these district utility projects, which are in a sense, they're monetizations in that a development team is coming in and writing a check and either in some cases, actually buying the district utility, buying all the systems that are supplying the campus. In other cases, coming in and buying into a long-term power purchase agreement, a long-term offtake agreement. Sometimes it's a hybrid of those. I think that those structures have a, they can really be positioned as a win-win deals. The university can plug a short-term gap and the developer can afford to take a longer term perspective on when demand is going to resume. These can be 30 year plus deals in some cases. So even if you're concerned about demand right now, people aren't back on campus, developers can take a view that three years plus out, things will return to normal and that's something we can bank on. To your question, I do see this likewise happening on some municipal scale. Particularly in cities, towns that have a municipal center, a civic center with multiple buildings. Sometimes they have their own utilities at each building that can be consolidated and improved. A lot of the story here is also you're getting a big capital improvement. These projects generally coincide with the need for capital improvements, the need to increase renewables mix, make things more efficient. And certainly at a municipal level, given what's going to happen to budget, what's happening with budgets there, that upfront check could go very far. Great. Any other comments on this one? Jeremy, do you? Yeah. I was gonna say there's one piece I thought, along with water and kind of your more social infrastructure, transit we think is a point for discussion in a lot of ways. Kind of hits at the nexus of what we all talk about in infrastructure, creating jobs, creating value and adding value to communities. And in particular, in this case, helping people get from point A to point B, in many cases, essential workers and those that really have to physically be at their jobs. I mean, people that work in hotels, people that work the cash register, they need a way to get to work that is cheaper than buying a car and paying for parking and paying for insurance and all those different pieces. So, we think that's gonna be a space that, especially in the conversation of equity, work equity, the conversation of developing communities, we think it's gonna be pretty good. Not only transit, but transit oriented development, we think are gonna be pretty much a pretty well focused asset class to look at. It's definitely gonna be one when the surface transportation bill comes out, there's gonna be conversation on how to distribute funding versus roads, versus transit. You can imagine that that conversation is shaping. I hope it's much less of a political conversation than it has been traditionally, but I think that's a conversation to be had, just financing transit. And also geographically, it is a conversation. More of the Northern and Northeastern cities and including where I'm from, Chicago, the issue is maintenance. How do you properly incentivize investors and investment in maintaining older facilities that are extensive and really detailed systems? Whereas the issue in your more suburban Southeast, Southwest United States is simply building a system that will centralize your urban regions, densify your urban centers and provide access to folks that are coming from other pockets to those urban centers. And then also basically creating value for those communities as well through transit. So you've got incentive on both sides to invest in transit, be it more regions without extensive transit systems. And you're seeing transactions happening there. I'm thinking about South Florida, Miami in particular. You're seeing that activity in Texas, particularly in Austin. We might've discussed the $7 billion bond offering that Austin did. And you have your Sepulveda project out in LA. There are a variety of projects. Jacksonville doing bus rapid transit. There's a variety of projects in which there will be innovative finance necessary, but the demand is there. And then when I talk about Northeast, MTA, MBTA come to mind. And those are basically really putting in capital to really maintain those systems which are currently under some levels of disrepair, to be honest. So we think that's gonna be a big piece for the next 20, 30 years. Yeah, and let's not forget my home state in New Jersey using this technique to find funding to renovate Metro Park, which is a major reactor back hub. And then with Liberty State Park as well in Jersey City, and then away from TOD, but also on trains, trying to put up a transit grid system, which honestly could be pretty revolutionary if it comes out the way as intended, but it's still very much in the early stages there, so. Yeah, there's no region you can't point to where this is not an issue. Here in DC, WMATA definitely has its issues. Judah can talk to that more than I can, but we're at that stage where I don't think you can point to any region where this opportunity for investment and improvement has not come up and it's not really before us. Andrew, do you have any more follow-up questions? Yeah, one thing I was going to ask, and you guys have touched on this, how do you think transportation is going to look different in a post-COVID world? Yeah, so I definitely have some thoughts. You know, I think once we have a vaccine and then, you know, we can all speculate as to when it's gonna be widely available and adopted, but I think many people are thinking, you know, transit will go back to being normal at that point and people will feel comfortable and safe doing so. Obviously, it's seen a huge hit in recent months for good reason, but I think what's really gonna change and impact and cities are gonna have to think through is the change in land use patterns and the way people work and where they live and work and commute and what that looks like. And so I think, you know, the cities that are smart about it and they've already been thinking about it even before COVID was how do we have these complete communities that are not just, you know, all office, all commercial, and they're super busy during the day and then everybody commutes out to the suburbs. It really is, you know, having that mixed use vital downtown 24 seven. And so in some ways that makes transit still critical, but it, you know, flattens out the peaks and rush hours and means that you're using the system, you know, throughout the day in different ways. And that allows you to do some cheaper options like micro mobility, like scooters, like electric bikes and those sorts of things that we're seeing, you know, in the big cities and are starting to make their way out to other places as well. So in some ways, maybe that, you know, takes the burden off, you know, the heavy rail and bus a little bit, but allows them to get more dedicated, reliable customers who are, you know, using their services all the time. Great. I thought it was interesting to see Uber getting rid of their self-driving car division this week. That was a, you know, a trend that we were all, that was an industry, a sector we were all looking at and wondering how it might change, you know, urban development and a lot of these commuting micro transit issues. So I'm still hopeful that will come, but maybe have to wait a bit longer. All right, gentlemen, that's about all the time we have. Thank you for coming on today's program and look forward to having you on another day soon. Thanks again and work out.

My name's Abby Miller, and I'm back at it again, hosting November's edition of the pod. Today, we will be discussing what has probably been on nearly everyone's mind around the globe for the past few weeks, the US presidential election. Major news networks made the call on Saturday that Joe Biden will be our next president, though President Trump has not yet conceded or potentially accepted the results of the election. With me, I've got Jill Jamieson, a well-known figure in the infrastructure, finance, and P3 space to discuss what we could see in the next four years. Jill, welcome to the show. Pleasure to be here. Yeah, so for anyone who doesn't know Jill, which is probably unlikely, she's been involved in the US P3 space for a while. When we met, Jill was managing director at JLL's public institutions practice, where she worked with both public and private sector clients and since leaving JLL in May, Jill has started her own advisory firm, Illuminati Advisors, which I really like the name of, just incidentally, and where she's president and CEO. So yeah, again, thanks for joining us, Jill, and let's get on into it. I guess I'll just hop in with, how are you feeling post-election? Are you feeling optimistic about the state of the United States and the market, or pessimistic or somewhere in between? Well, I think it depends on what we're talking about, right? I think few of us are elated with the way things are unfolding sort of post-election, right? The uncertainty around accepting the results and recounts and those sorts of things. I think it's giving everyone collective angst and maybe fraying our very last nerves, but from sort of an infrastructure finance perspective, I don't think that we've had any sort of earth-shatteringly big news either way. In Washington, I'm assuming that Biden will be coming in with a new administration. He's not an unknown figure. He's been very vocal and very transparent in terms of his plans going forward. I think the big uncertainty is, how will the elections play out in terms of the Senate and Congress? Because I think that will dictate to some extent what he will be able to do in terms of implementing the plans that he's set out thus far. Right, that actually leads well into my next question, which is, if the Democrats don't take the Senate, which is not something that we'll know until I guess early to mid-January, is there any hope of getting any sort of infrastructure plan or stimulus passed? So I think there is. So there are a couple of things. The discussions of the blue wave, obviously they didn't manifest, right? And so we didn't have what we call a supermajority in the Senate would be 53 or more in Democrat space. And that way you can change rules and get a lot done pretty quickly. Less than that, we always knew there would need to be compromise. And whether the Republicans remain with the majority, whether it's tied with the Vice President breaking the tire, whether the Democrats take a majority, either way, it was gonna require us to, as a nation, to make some compromises. I think it would have been quite frankly difficult to implement just writ large, the Build Back Better plan in terms of everything that it was asking for, right? There was always gonna be some need for compromise. But I don't think that we need to be pessimistic about it. Infrastructure remains a kitchen table issue. Both sides are very much committed to it. The problem that we've always had is how to pay for it. And there are very different positions on that between the Republicans and the Democrats. And then some of the pecking order, right? So are we gonna be looking at urban transit or are we gonna be looking at rural transportation? Where is the money going and how it's gonna be put out there? But I think right now, the size of the stimulus package, whether the stimulus would be part of the infrastructure package or would be separate from that, there's still a lot of questions there. But I do not think, to be quite frank with you, that infrastructure is going to be the laughing stock that it has been, quite frankly, for the last few years. We always joke about infrastructure week here in D.C. When everything goes bad, it's infrastructure week, right? Because nothing ever happened. I do think that there's gonna be a more serious look at this. And the other thing I would say is, regardless of one's politics, Joe Biden has been around for a long time and he knows how to build consensus and knows how to work across the aisle. And so if there is ever going to be a hope of getting both sides of the chamber to come together on something for infrastructure, he may be our best bet at this moment. So I remain cautiously optimistic. I was never naive enough to believe that he could just step in on day one and implement the entire Build Back Better plan. 2.5 trillion would be awesome to see, but we knew that that was a starting point in negotiation. So I remain cautiously optimistic. Yeah, definitely. I think that more or less echoes how I've been feeling about it. And you touched on a little bit how something so large would be paid for. In the last few years, the deficit under the Trump administration has increased, but that seems to be something that only is really a talking point when a Democrat is in office, at least from the other side of the aisle. Do you think that that's something that's going to come up a lot and could potentially get in the way of any sort of either stimulus or infrastructure bill or mix of the two? Absolutely it will, because that's what happens, right? So it's not an issue until it becomes an issue. But I think there are two things, right? And one is the stimulus itself. And I actually probably fall on the side of this debate that most people would not expect. The idea of investing massive amounts in infrastructure as a way to stimulate the economy and bring us back from the COVID sort of recession has had support from President Trump. It has support from incoming President Biden. It's had support from Congress and the Democrats in Congress. The sticking point on that has been Republicans in the Senate. And their view of it is that for better or worse, deficit or no deficit, is that they have not been able to justify it on the basis of they don't see how that sort of investment is going to have a response that will pull us out of this sort of recession that we're in. And the reason for that is that we all know infrastructure are the long lead items, right? So there are very few shovel ready projects that if you just put money in that immediately you can start working on, right? But secondly, if you look at the sort of the characteristics of the COVID impact, those who lost their jobs, those who are unemployed, those who are looking for work did not come mostly from the construction industry. They came from services industry. And it's really hard. We've already had workforce shortages in the infrastructure sector before the COVID. And so if you put more money into this, there is concern that it's just going to drive up prices because we can't easily transition a server at Applebee's into a crane operator, right? It takes time to build up the workforce capacity. So I think that that's been probably one of the sticking points is that it's not that they don't necessarily want infrastructure is that they have not seen the correlation between the stimulus package infrastructure and the response that they want. But that's very different than if we look more broadly at sort of the build back better or any of the infrastructure packages that have been positive over the last few years, right? I think universally, we can all agree that United States is woefully in need of massive amounts of investment in our infrastructure across the spectrum, whether it's in water, transportation, energy, et cetera. We just need a lot of things. And I think there, there is consensus. Where they get stuck there is on how to pay for it, right? And deficit spending has been the sticking point. If Biden had gotten the supermajority that he was after, he had anticipated that he would pay for it by raising taxes on anyone making over $400,000 a year. And that was gonna generate enough of an income stream to be able to fund that 2.5 trillion. I think Wall Street actually was quite comfortable with that as well. Now that he doesn't have the supermajority, tax reform is gonna become complicated, right? And so I do think there's gonna have to be some scaling back of that. But I think that, yeah, we kind of have to separate stimulus from infrastructure because I think stimulus as a means to, excuse me, infrastructure as a means to stimulus is probably always gonna get stuck in the Senate because of sort of that lack of correlation between outcome and income, if that makes sense. Right, yeah, that does make sense. That's not something that I had really thought of. You know, we think of infrastructure and immediately think of new jobs, but the way that you put it does make sense. Even outside of stimulus and the correlation with job creation, et cetera, you know, both sides of the aisle, the Trump administration as well as Biden, they've talked a great length about the need to build up, you know, our construction workforce as well and our infrastructure workforce. So I think that that's something that needs to happen as well. But right now, I think the fear is that if you throw a lot of money into the infrastructure sector, which really is gonna drive up prices in the short term, that is a stimulus that is very different than the need to create long-term sustainable funding for infrastructure, whether it's new infrastructure, O&M of existing infrastructure, or just modernization in general. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense in terms of jobs and the way that jobs are transitioned. I'm not sure that I thought of that or seen that argument, but it definitely does make sense. And I can see why that would be a barrier in terms of getting something passed or wanting to make that a priority. Yeah, I think if I can just expand on one thing on that. Yeah, so this is my pet peeve, and I'm just gonna say it out there because I think it needs to be put to the universe every now and again, is that the unfortunate thing in the United States is both red and blue, but the Democrats and the Republicans consistently look at infrastructure as a means to an end, right? And so infrastructure is a means to create jobs and obviously it has done that. We look back at the New Deal, FDR helped create jobs as we built our infrastructure. Right now, we are in a very different situation. We're in a situation where we are almost catastrophically seeing the decline of our infrastructure. We've got, what is it, 58,000 water main breaks a day in the United States. We've got bridges that are dangerously falling down. We have dams that are, Oroville Dam that just burst one day. We're not in a situation where we can look at infrastructure as a means to an end. We also need to look at it as an end in and of itself. And to that, I do think that there are externalities involved, for instance, creating jobs, generating economic growth and those sorts of things. But if I could pick at both sides of the aisle on this is that we need to take a realistic and holistic look at infrastructure as an end in and of itself. Our competitivity as a nation is part of this. So I think when we see things like, let's invest in infrastructure to stimulate the economy or maybe we can create jobs. I'm not disagreeing that that is something that could happen if we invest in infrastructure. My point is that we should be investing in infrastructure, period. Not because of the externalities, because we need to modernize our assets or we will not be a competitive nation in the future. And I think that's probably where I might be quibbling a little bit, but that's where I might differ than both sides of the aisle. And that's sort of, if I had a voice in this, that's what I would be saying to those who are listening. We have to come up with a long-term, sustainable infrastructure funding and management plan that is not subject to sort of the whims and the cyclical nature of investing just when we need some jobs or just when we need this or just when we need that, particularly in the election season. So anyway, I've said that now, you can go on to your next question, sorry. Yeah, no, certainly. Yeah, thanks for expanding. Yeah, so like I was saying, I'm just gonna switch lanes a little. I know that, I mean, we have probably all heard the news that yesterday Biden selected Ronald Klain as his new chief of staff and Phil Washington from LA Metro, who I'm not sure if you've worked with him at all, but he is joining Biden's transition team. Do you have any ideas who might be selected to replace someone like Elaine Chao or head up the USDOT or fill any of those other infrastructure-related posts? So it's a great question. And we spend in the DC area probably more time than we should in the speculation. It's a parlor game that we play. Right, we've heard Mayor Garcetti is a possible candidate. We've heard a lot of people. The one thing I can say is that the Biden administration has been around for so long that they know, I mean, they have very deep talent pools that they can pull from in this. So I'm not concerned about them finding talented people and whether it's Mayor Garcetti or whether it is somebody else that goes into DOT, I think that leadership is gonna be important. The challenge that they have or that we have as a nation is that transportation is not all of our infrastructure, right? So you've gotta get pretty darn wonky in terms of transition and in terms of leadership to start addressing at the federal level all the different infrastructure we need. So you can look at positions like the ASA, Assistant Secretary of the Army, who oversees the core civil works program. You've gotta look at VA, you've gotta look at DOE, right? So, you know, I'm absolutely confident that they're gonna be able to find good people for those positions. The other challenge is that bringing people in from the outside, which you need to do, I mean, that's what happens. But it's really very different in terms of what the federal government can do in terms of infrastructure versus what the local experience is, right? So it's easy to understand if you work at the state or local level. Look, you know, we like federal credit programs, but we don't like all the strings attached or why don't you just give us more money, et cetera, et cetera. Whereas at the federal level, the things that keep people up at night have more to do with how OMB is gonna score a budget and, you know, some of the delivery elements like continuing contracts and those sorts of things. So there needs to be that marriage between I think the state and local expertise, which I'm absolutely positive that the Biden administration is gonna pull in together with sort of that federal knowledge, which they also know. So I don't know, I'll be honest with you. I mean, we literally talk about this too much, I think, in the DC area about who might be in what position. I think we'll know soon enough, right? But right now I think that I do have confidence that they can pull in the right sorts of talent for this because they've just, you know, Biden's been around this environment for a very long time. And unlike somebody who's coming in for the first time to Washington, he does know how the system works and he's gonna have to balance DC versus the rest of it. But I don't know for sure who might be there. The names I hear are probably the same as you hear, like, like Garcetti. Okay, and then also kind of just switch lanes again, sort of. And as the last question that I'll ask, you know, we saw some recent advances in P3 projects in the market. One was Prince George's County selecting a winning team and getting bankers involved. And do you think that indicates momentum in the market or regardless of the outcome of the election, will there still be kind of a pause given the fiscal health in cities and states related to the COVID-19 crisis, which seems to only be getting worse again? So, yeah, I mean, I think that all the projects that I was working on pre, P3 projects that I was working on pre-COVID have continued right along on their merry way with very little interruption. Obviously, there've been big stages, due diligence for a little longer and those sorts of things. But I really didn't see COVID have a massive impact on the P3 market one way or the other. Yeah, there were some unpredictable moments there in May and April, May and June when, you know, we had tax exempt and taxable finance inverted in terms of yield curves. And we, you know, had issues with credit spread and those sorts of things. But the market has remained pretty consistent in terms of P3. I don't think COVID has moved the needle in terms of what people are looking at in terms of finance and delivery model. I do think, however, that there has been a massive reshuffling of priorities. So projects that were not really already in the process of moving forward, if you were looking at GDP driven sectors, say for instance, transportation, toll roads and those sorts of things, obviously became very difficult to move forward with P3s because nobody was driving for a while, right? Airports became really problematic because they were going into distress, right? So we had a lot of those issues. I spent a lot of my time negotiating sort of remedies and whatnot to sort of that fiscal downturn in those. But in other areas like public schools, like water systems, we've seen continued growth and even their new projects coming to market as you know, Santa Clara Valley and the water district with the purification project. Lake Oswego continues to move forward. Fresno State has moved forward as well. So I think everything is just sort of moving in their own way. Maybe things are taking a little bit longer. I do think, however, maybe not the full Monty in terms of P3, I think that we are seeing a lot of contracting agencies now look at sort of bridge financing. So DBF, performance-based contracting, those sorts of things, so that they can at least defer payments until after completion of the project when the economy has come back to full footing, right? But I think there are, yeah, I think there are a number of things, reshuffling of priorities and this need for some bridge financing. There is less money for sure. And so again, priorities as they shift, may have projects that were sort of on the edge and maybe we'll do this, maybe we won't, that becomes sort of mothballed for a little bit longer. And that's where a stimulus or more money for infrastructure could be helpful. But I've said it many times, I saw the COVID situation, it did not interrupt my day ever. You know, we've been working 24 seven on projects and value money assessments and all those sorts of things. So the market continues to be robust. It's not a bit more complicated. COVID to me was agnostic in terms of delivery model. And I think it'll probably remain as such. And likewise, the election. Some people are like, oh, this will be bad for P3 and others are like, oh, this will be good for P3. I honestly think, you know, the election was P3 agnostic. P3 remains another tool in the toolkit. What is making it probably a little bit more challenging for public agencies to opt for the P3 model is the low interest rate environment that we're in, right? So if you can issue bonds on something at 0.7%, or 0.8%, versus private financing that at a blended rate might come in at 3%, that's a pretty big delta to explain to your shareholders or your taxpayers or your rate payers, right? And so, you know, sort of the spread that a private sector financing premium, I think has been one of those things that had been a little bit challenging for public sector agencies to get over, particularly in this very low interest rate environment. I know that there are a lot of people, smart people out there working on those issues in terms of lowering sort of the private finance premium. And I think that there's been good advancements in that manner. But, you know, those who need private sector financing will still seek it. Those who are on the cusp and sort of 50-50, they may opt not to use private financing, but that's been the case forever, right, in the US market. So yeah, I don't think there's been a massive impact from COVID on P3, but in my world, where I'm sitting in my seat, I see a very robust line. I'm working on projects that are energy, transportation, lots of water, ecosystem restoration projects. So a very diverse set of infrastructure, and all of them are exploring P3, and some are at market, some are at closing, and some will soon be coming to market, hopefully. Great, great. Well, thank you, Jill, for being here. Unfortunately, that's all the time that we have. So thank you, everyone, for listening, and we'll be back again next month. My pleasure, and thanks for having me. And yeah, well, we'll see. After they select a cabinet, we'll see who's in there. But regardless, yeah, America needs to invest in infrastructure. So hopefully, no matter who they put in there, we'll believe that as well. I agree, yep. All right, well, thank you again for joining us, and thank you, everyone, for listening in.

I'm John Burke, America's Editor for Information. Joining me today is Michael Ryder, Senior Managing Director and Head of America for OMERS Infrastructure. Jonathan Carmody, Editor for Information Latin America. And Marco Espinoza, VP and Director of Operations for the CACSOR Group. Thanks for all joining me today, guys. Thanks, John. Nice to be here. Thanks for having us. So, Marco, we're going to hear from you a little bit later in the program on a $3.3 billion cross-border logistics project that CACSOR has in the works. But first, we go to decarbonization and greenhouse gas emission reduction remaining a major focus for fund managers as both an investment thesis as well as a function of social consciousness, given all the challenges our world continues to face. OMERS Infrastructure sits on $21.3 billion in assets under management, spanning investments all over the world. Since joining OMERS in early 2018, one of Ryder's first investments came in helping build out its renewable platform through its acquisition of Leeward Renewable Energy, at the time a portfolio of 1.7 gigawatts of renewable assets. And this is where our discussion begins. So, Michael, Leeward has been quite busy in the past few years under OMERS stewardship. Can you give us an update on the projects in the pipeline? John, thanks for having me on the podcast today. I really appreciate the chance to be here. As you mentioned, I joined OMERS almost three years ago to lead the infrastructure business in the Americas region. And although infrastructure has grown as an asset class over the last five to ten years more broadly, OMERS has actually been a direct investor in infrastructure for much longer than that. Our platform goes back to the late 90s, more than 20 years. We've been a leader and a direct investor in the sector. We have a long-term investment horizon, which we think differentiates us in the market. And we take a pretty active and engaged approach to managing the portfolio to drive value creation for our pensioner members. As you mentioned, we made a significant investment in Leeward Renewable Energy in 2018. We acquired 100% of the company, and the business at that time owned approximately 1.7 gigawatts of wind generation assets and had a pretty significant portfolio of development projects that we thought was quite interesting. So we've owned Leeward for just over two years now, and we've been incredibly busy with the company, working closely with management in order to both grow value at the existing assets and also realize a portion and grow that development project pipeline. When we worked through our diligence for the acquisition, we identified a number of potential value creation opportunities and growth strategies and worked in detail with the management team to flesh those out. And over the past couple of years, we've partnered to build on that and continue to look for more ways in which we can grow. So Jason Allen and the management team at Leeward have done a fantastic job and really supported that strategy. A couple of things that we've done. We've grown the development team by over 20 people during the past two years. We've significantly enhanced our capabilities, both on the wind side and on the solar side, which was not an area that Leeward was focused on but for our investment. We've also had considerable success completing three new projects. Well, I should say in the process of completing those projects. We have a couple that have reached COD this year and one that we expect to finalize and reach COD by the end of this year. And we have another exciting new project that we haven't quite announced yet but we hope to announce before the end of the year and it will be a large focus over the next 12 to 18 months. So all of this has been despite the challenging pandemic environment we've managed through. We're adding gigawatts. We're expanding our portfolio. We expect to be approximately two gigawatts of operating assets by the end of the year. And as I said, we continue to expand the development project portfolio as well, not only in wind but in solar. So a pretty busy couple of years, you might say. Yeah, and a couple more years to come in that same discussion. So let's take it to a broader level and talk about what OMERS ESG thesis today looks like and some of the measures it's taken in this vein for its own portfolio investments, which seems to be an increasing theme amongst global asset managers in general, not just for OMERS, but certainly curious to hear where you guys come in on this. Look, you're right. ESG and environmental, social, and governance factors are increasingly important for everyone. I think driven by a greater sensitivity and interest among the broad investment community, which is driven by a greater sensitivity and interest in not only climate change but more broadly in social and governance considerations as well. As you know and as I said before, we take a long-term perspective when we consider new investments. And if you look at investments on a long-term timeframe, ESG factors are not new. They've been critically important for a very considerable amount of time and they drive the performance of our investments and how we think about value creation in those investments, not only in the past but also as we look out to the future. So as a result, we've considered ESG factors as an important element in our investment evaluations for many years and also when we take strategic considerations around our existing assets in our portfolio. When we evaluate a new investment, we view the integration of ESG considerations not as a trade-off with generating strong returns for our pension members, but as a complement to that risk return assessment, and it really is one of the key factors that we consider when we're evaluating a transaction. That all said, we always acknowledge that we can continue to learn more and we've been working hard over the past 12, 24 months to see if we can even further integrate these critical factors into our business and into our performance assessments. In the past year, for example, we've done a lot of work regarding the transition to a low-carbon economy across our portfolio of existing assets and given thought to how that impacts future investments, and obviously it's a key topic of discussion on every investment that we bring to committee. A couple of examples, at Puget Sound, we're working with our investment partners and the management team out there on our strategy to comply with the Washington State Clean Energy Act. That's an important initiative for us and for the company and one that we're very, very supportive of. It's also worth noting, you know, a lot of focus when people talk about ESG is on the E, and across Brookhomers broadly and within our infrastructure team, we are also very, very focused on the S and the G. No surprise in the environment that we have all seen and experienced over the past 12 months. We have been reassessing and reevaluating our own performance on inclusion and diversity. We have been promoting greater gender and racial diversity at our portfolio management teams, and we continue to look at ways in which we can enhance our efforts and our successes on ensuring that we have a diverse and inclusive team that reflect the communities in which all of our portfolio companies manage. We also know that our portfolio companies provide essential services, you know, within the communities in which they operate, and so social and governance factors are critically important that at LifeLabs, which is our medical labs business up in Ontario, we've supported the Ontario and the BC governments in the rollout of a COVID testing program, and we've developed COVID-frequent testing programs that are used by corporations and sports leagues across Canada to remain open through this pandemic and operate safely for their employees and customers. So these types of initiatives go beyond just lower carbon intensity and consider all of the factors within being corporate citizens and contributing to the communities. One could say ESG is really in our DNA when we think about how we evaluate new opportunities and how we consider the management and governance of our portfolio. Terrific. Thank you for that, Michael. When we last talked, you mentioned to me about Bruce Power, which is another one of Omer's portfolio companies, as the largest operating nuclear power facility in the world, and it's been sort of a legacy investment with Omer's going on 17 years, and you mentioned it in the same breath as we were talking about ESG and this investment being part of energy transition. Can you just walk us through the mechanics of this? Absolutely, and it's a fantastic example. We made that investment 17-odd years ago, and look, I can't take the credit, but I give a huge deal of credit to my predecessors in this role and in the foresight that they had to participate in buying and now expanding that phenomenal asset. Bruce is pretty unique. It's a zero emission clean energy investment. It provides approximately 30% of Ontario's power supply. It employs 4,000 people and generates its total capacity is around 6.8 gigawatts. So it's significant. It's the largest single site nuclear power plant in the world, and it's helped Ontario become a power grid which has one of the lowest emissions in the world. So Bruce was a key element to Ontario's phase-out of coal and oil fire generation. It enabled the province to transition to reliable, inexpensive, and carbon-free electricity that really is based on both the nuclear and the hydro resources in the province. And we are now with TC Energy, our 50% partner, repowering the business, Bruce, under a multi-decade agreement with the province. So we're going to take 10-plus years and invest billions of dollars in repowering Bruce so it can continue to be a clean source of energy for the province for decades to come. And it's not just the environmental record where I think Bruce is a really active contributor. It's worth noting Bruce also produces cobalt-60, which is a medical isotope. We ship that around the world to treat through radiology, treat brain tumors, breast cancer. It's used to sterilize medical equipment. And indeed, we've been investing over the last couple of years to grow our production of this important isotope and also to bring on other isotopes that will be able to be used in medical procedures. So, you know, we see Bruce as a phenomenal example of how we are supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and also how we can contribute more broadly to the community in which we live. Great. So what other alternative energies is OMERS looking at at this point, and why are they appealing? Obviously, Leeward has a strong base of wind projects currently out there, operational and under development. What other kind of energies are you guys looking at? Yeah, look, as long-term investors, we spend a lot of time understanding and evaluating long-term trends, such as the transition to lower-carbon economy and the likely impact on our portfolio and our future investments. Over time, we do anticipate that our portfolio will evolve. It will reflect lower-carbon energy sources and probably much in the same way that we've grown our investments in telecom and data over the past few years to reflect the shift in the economy towards that sector. I talked before about the focus of Leeward on solar. We've been building our expertise there and have built a development team to be able to focus on opportunities in that space. And we're looking for new solar opportunities with Leeward in North America. And then more broadly, we're looking at new investments to build out solar around the world. We've also been developing a deeper understanding of the battery storage space. We've evaluated a number of smaller opportunities recently in that sector. We think the storage space is interesting and one which we hope to be able to find a path to putting capital into and investing in and supporting in the not-too-distant future. But it also is still going through its challenges and frequently requires subsidies or other support from off-takers in order to justify the economics. So that's one where we're spending time that we're, at least to date, we haven't quite seen the opportunity that matches our risk profile and return profile. We continue to look at other potential technologies that will help navigate the transition, technologies such as demand response management, methane capture technology, carbon sequestration, and potentially the support for growth in the electric car park through charging networks. Every technology like this that we look at, we've got to constantly balance the take-up risk and the broader technological and cost risk against our focus on long-term stable critical infrastructure, which is ultimately the hallmark of our portfolio and what we believe is best able to provide a strong returns for our pension members. But we also look and we think these emerging areas will revolve over the medium term and hopefully over time, they will meet our investment criteria and will require a lot of capital to fully develop and to build out. And so that's where we think that we will become very logical, active investors in some of these spaces. Excellent. Can I ask you one last question about EV infrastructure, which you just touched on there? You know, we have in our, not on our pages, but on our web pages, written about, you know, how states, aside from California, are starting to ramp up EV infrastructure incentives and sometimes procuring new greenfield in that area. Is that market still a little bit too nascent for you guys at this point, even if it is as a future appeal or something you're looking at further? It's an area that we're spending more and more time on, John. I think quite recently, New York State announced an incentive and there's been obviously a lot of support out on the West Coast. Where we're spending more time looking at it, I do think it's an area where we will be able to invest significant capital and support to build out over time. It's a matter of working through the subsidy structures and supports that are likely to be needed to do that, both with the governments and regulators, but also with the utilities and transmission operators who are likely to actually bring a lot of that power. And we are quite fortunate, given the seat that we sit in, we own regulated utilities in Texas, in Washington State. We have power generation in a number of states through Leeward and through Bruce and through other assets. And so we feel we are very, very well positioned to understand the market and to be a contributor and a bringer of capital or a provider of capital over time. Honestly, it's been challenging to make the returns work to date, but we suspect that the market structure will evolve and mature over the not too distant future and we hope to be able to participate. Great. Well, Michael, thank you for your time today. Really appreciate you coming on the program. Thanks, John. Enjoyed it and have a great rest of the day. So from renewable investments, we go to logistics and cross-border logistics. We'll hand it over to you, Mr. Kermode. Take it away. Thanks, John. So today we have an interesting guest. We're talking to Marco Espinosa from Caxor Group. We published an article in Information last week about an impressive project that they're designing at Caxor for what they call the USMCA Corridor, US-Mexico-Canada Corridor. It's a logistics project which involves the construction of port facilities in Mexico, logistics centers along the rail routes between Mazatlan in Sonora and Winnipeg in Canada, and a few rail connections as well that could prove interesting for rail developers. So I wanted to talk a little bit to you today, Marco, about Caxor Group, who you guys are, and what you're planning here with this project. So if you could start with a brief introduction of yourself and Caxor, and we can talk a little about the project. Thank you, Jonathan. Yes, my name is Marco Espinosa. I'm the Senior Vice President and Director of Operations of Caxor Group. We're a Mexico City-based firm with offices in London, in the Middle East as well, in the UAE, Colombia, and Panama. We specialize mainly in Latin American infrastructure projects, and we also represent National Standard Finance based out of Atlanta for the Latin America area. We were founded about 15 years ago, and we've been operating in Latin America now for the better part of about four years. We've developed a very close relationship specifically with the current Mexican government, Mexican administration. We are currently participating in several energy projects, combined cycle power plants, a few port facilities here in Mexico, a few fuel storage deposit facilities, as well as some energy projects in Panama and in Colombia. We've been named by the Mexican Presidential Office as the Project Integrator for the USMCA Corridor Project, as it's been named, which basically encompasses rehabilitating a large amount of rail. We're talking about 167 kilometers of rail to be rehabilitated, 84 new kilometers of rail, which will give Mexico through the Mazatlan port area access to the 7,115 kilometers that are in the North American corridor that go all the way up into Winnipeg. Essentially, the purpose of this project is to guarantee full integration between, obviously, Mexico, the United States and Canada, and also give access to goods coming in from Asia to take off a little bit of the cargo load that is saturated in Manzanillo and in Long Beach. Fantastic. Marco, it's certainly a very, very ambitious project. Looking at the size, we were talking about a figure previously of around $3.3 billion. Could you just break down where that investment is going to go to in the project? Yes. Essentially, the investment is broken up into three areas. We have the development of the port facility in Mazatlan, which is going to be about 2,000 hectares, which will be rehabilitated and created into the main port facility that will receive goods primarily from Asia, Africa and Europe as well, even though it's on the Pacific side. Then the secondary part would be the rail component, which we have a lot of interest from some of the largest rail operators in the United States. I can't mention the name on the record yet because we're in final negotiations with them, but there's a lot of interest for one of the major operators already to take that part of the project. And then the final component are the several logistics and storage centers that are going to be along the rail line that will guarantee the consolidation of cargo, the integration of different products that are manufactured in the north of Mexico, which accounts for about 25% of our GDP already, as well as almost $100 billion worth of export capacity. So those are basically the three components that make up the $3.3 billion that we have planned for this project. Now I'd like to ask you a little bit more about the structure of the investments, Marco. In terms of these individual sections, as I understand it, you're planning to divide the individual investment areas up into different SPVs, different trusts, manage them separately, but as part of a wider project. How does Caxor Group and your partners at National Standard Finance participate in these projects, and what is really the role that you perform for investors in these projects? Caxor is, we like to call ourselves kind of all-in-one because we're essentially a project integrator that also has the financial arm of the debt component. So we are not greenfield developers and we do not put in our own equity. We essentially account for 80% of the debt component. Initially, right now, with the Mexican government, through our development banks of NAFIN, which is the National Infrastructure Bank, Banobras, which is the National Public Works Bank and Bancomext, which is our Ex-Im Bank, they will be providing, let's say, the greenfield development funds that will allow the project to be viable and then to have the private investors come in with the equity component. Right now, the equity component is being looked at by, for example, in the rail component side, one of the largest rail operators in the United States. For the port side, we have one of the largest operators in the UAE who's interested in putting the equity for that component, as well as another potential investor from the Netherlands, which is also one of the largest operators there. And then for the logistics centers, we have a few national companies that are logistics operators that are interested in taking that component. So essentially, the three stages are obviously the government support part, which is the government, let's say, subsidy part, which essentially is the pre-development, and then the equity side, which will come from the private players, and then finally the debt component, which we are obviously looking with our partners at National Standard Finance to place about 80% of the project's value in debt. Marco, what's the timeframe that you're looking at for the development of these different projects? So the timeframe, obviously it's a very ambitious project, Jonathan, and obviously we don't expect to complete the project fully in this presidential term, although obviously that is the objective. Essentially, we'll start off with the port side of the project, followed by the rail, and then the logistics centers, there are several of them, there are between three and six planned. But right now, the speed is actually quite alarming because the Mexican federal government has already initiated placing 2,000 hectares in trust to initiate the port development side, so already Mexican authorities, including the Secretary of the Environment, the Secretary of the Economy, the National Infrastructure Banks that I already mentioned, they have already been given instructions and are already placing in trust 2,000 hectares for the initial development of the project, so it's moving extremely quickly. Now, I believe, and we believe here at CAXR that we will be able to have an initial port initiation within the next 12 months, so that we actually start initial construction within the following 12 months. We have the full support of the Mexican government, like I mentioned, and authorities. The permitting side will be carried out by the government itself, which will obviously cut a lot of the red tape that is faced, you know, specifically in the United States, so a lot of the operators that we've been talking to on the logistics and rail side already had their own projects that they were independently seeking to develop, and upon hearing about CAXR being named for the development of this specific project, they approached us organically saying, hey, we were looking at doing this already, but now that we have you guys who have been named by the Mexican government to do this, let's integrate, let's consolidate our efforts to try and make this go as quickly as possible. So we have a huge advantage in timing there, and what a lot of them have told us, and what we know is obviously Mexico is a little bit more lax when it comes to the regulations and to the time frames of getting a lot of these permits out. These things tend to take a lot less time in Mexico than, for example, in the United States, so this is one of the competitive advantages that we have. I mean, to give you an idea, you know, if you're going to develop a highway in the United States, it could take up to five, six years of planning, whereas here in Mexico we could do it in half the time just simply because of the bureaucratic side of the equation is actually a lot simpler. So we're looking at initiating the first phase realistically within 12 months, and then we're aiming at a full conclusion of the project within the next four years. It's interesting you talk about the simplicity of the bureaucracy in Mexico. I'm sure you're well aware that in the last few years under President Andres Manuel López Obrador, we've heard a lot about infrastructure investors, in particular in the energy space, complaining about governments' attempts to limit private investment in the infrastructure and energy sectors. You seem to have a very good relationship with the Mexican government, so I was wondering if there's any particular advice you could give to investors who are looking to develop projects in the region who might be cautious about what they've been hearing about Mexico. Well, Jonathan, you're absolutely right. When it comes to energy specifically, there is a larger issue at hand that does have to do with the internal politics. You have to remember that this current government is a left-leaning government, so they're very focused on the social good and social well-being, which I think is also fantastic because we haven't had the opportunity to have a government like that in Mexico in more than 50 years, quite frankly. So on that side, on the energy side, I would caution investors in general because there is a policy, again, when it comes specifically to the energy sector, to strengthen the national energy companies, so the CFE, which is our electrical company, and PEMS. So that is definitely already out in the open and that is the tendency that this government has. So again, on energy, I would be very cautious, especially when it comes to renewables, which is unfortunate, but there's a good argument that the government also makes for that. When it comes to wind and solar, because of the variations in power delivery, it's causing a lot of problems and disruption to the Mexican electrical grid. And so the CFE, which is the federal part, has to take care of that and then has to subsidize that and then has to find the solution for that because at the end of the day, the transmission lines are theirs. So there are also some things that do have to do with the social well-being of the country, which were not considered necessarily in past governments. It was more, you know, making money for the sake of making money. And this government is focused towards the social impact equation part of the project. So when we're talking about the North Corridor train or the USMCA train, there's also another project, which is kind of a mirror project, which is called the ISMO project, which is a train in the south, which is the same thing. And they're both geared towards the same idea. Is this going to create a benefit for the general population? How many people can it impact? And the Mexican government currently in power is open to anything that will create a positive impact and obviously a trickle down effect to the inhabitants of the communities where it's built. So I think that's a key component. And again, I think that just this is, I think, the rule of thumb in any country where you go is you have to get in bed with the local people. So we're operators here for Mexico. Our team at Caxor is multidisciplinary. Some of us come from a construction background. Some of us are contractors from the past. Some of us are bankers, but we've been doing business in Mexico for a long time. So I think that helps us to have the vision and also to have the realistic outlook of how we can make this work. And again, you mentioned they're obviously getting to bed with the locals in different countries. Mexico is not the only country where you guys are operating. You said you had offices in London, Panama and Colombia. Tell us more about some of the other projects in the U.S. as well. Well, in the U.S. we have our strategic alliance with National Standard Finance, which essentially is one of our strongest financing arms. And we don't operate in the United States. We operate for them in Latin America. But in Panama, essentially we have a great relationship with the current government there as well. They're looking at taking the opportunity right now because of COVID, they looked obviously at their export driven and basically transit, sorry, transit logistics driven economy. And they realized that, hey, we have surpluses, but we don't have industry. So one of the things that we've been tasked with by the Panamanian government right now is to look at several industrial opportunities that have to do with local fuel refining that have to do with very large mining projects because they have one of the largest copper easements in the Americas that they're looking to develop. And also just secondary industry when it comes to potentially some manufacturing and assembly of components. And so that's what we're looking at in Panama. And then in Colombia, we're specifically looking at two port projects and a train project. And then in the UAE we're looking at some defense related projects. And that's just a relationship that we developed organically with some members of the royal family there. So those are essentially the projects that we're looking at right now in the Americas and in UAE. Mark, thank you so much for sharing that with us. I know already for a fact from speaking to our readers that it's already generating a lot of interest, what you're doing with USMCA Corridor. Sounds like you're very busy. So I'll let you get back to it and we'll pass it over to John Burke. Thanks for coming on. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Have a great day. Thanks, Marco. And thanks for coming on the program today. So before I let you go, I just wanted to quickly mention that on November 9th, we are doing a webinar for Latin American renewables at the start of a new decade, I believe is what we titled it, Mr. Carmody. We are having on the program Guido Cerini from Credit Suisse and Carlos Marron from Phatagreen and Ricardo Diaz from Cubico Investments. Who was the fourth one, Jonathan? I also got Saurabh Anand coming from Denim Capital. They've been investing through a few platform companies in the region, companies like Rio Energy and Sabre Energy. So we're really interested to hear about how they're developing those platforms and how they envision renewable investing in the next decade. Terrific. And you can find some more information on that event on our website. Anyway, that's all the time we got. Thanks for listening in for today's podcast and we'll see you next time. Thank you.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-10-02 16:20:39+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### BDO discusses evolving US P3 market\n**Episode ID:** 4436\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to this month's edition of Information's Crossroad Podcast. My name's Abby Miller, and this month we've decided to take a bit of a detour with JB passing over the reins to me. Some of you may have heard me on the show before and we thought it was about time I got in the driver's seat. Like many of the virtual Coffee Break discussions happening over the past few months, today we're going to again talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the infrastructure world and how the P3 model could evolve with the times. First, I'll be speaking with Director of Infrastructure at BDO, Seth Miller-Gabriel. Then I'll bring in John Burke to discuss next week's US P3 conference hosted by Information. Gentlemen, welcome to the show. Thank you. For anyone who doesn't know Seth, he has had a well-traveled path in the P3 realm before coming to BDO in September. Seth served as Director of Strategic Initiatives and Programs with the Association for the Improvement of American Infrastructure. Before that, he served as Director of the Washington DC Office of Public-Private Partnerships. Thanks for joining us, Seth. Thank you very much for having me. Yeah. Let's just jump right into it. How are you seeing the market react to the COVID-19 situation? Well, that's a great question, Abby. The market has been reacting in some pretty significant ways. For one, projects that have been in process are already moving along into past design phase, into construction phase, are getting done. In many cases, that has been a great benefit to the jurisdiction where those projects are located. It's keeping folks employed and keeping things moving forward. On the downside, we're seeing a lack of planning for new projects, which is understandable because you have governments at all level, and the private sector as well, uncertain what the future might hold for large-scale infrastructure projects, and what the new normal for infrastructure will look like. There's going to be a gap in project planning. The difficult days ahead a little bit in the short-term, hopefully, where you're going to have a lack of some projects so that plan is not getting done. But on the back end of that, seeing a great potential where there's going to be pent-up demand that's been waiting for these projects. Anticipate an uptick in new projects as that planning comes back online, and infrastructure does need to get built or rebuilt as we move forward. So our approach where it's going to be a bit of a roller coaster, but I think it's going to lead to a significant increase in the amount of public-private partnerships getting done here in the United States. Do you think that we'll see the market shift to different types of projects when that demand increases again? Yeah. I do believe we're going to see a shift from what has been traditionally a transport-only market here in the US, with a few social projects here and there, to one where we're going to have a marked increase in the number of social or non-transport projects. If you think about how we're going to conduct business in the future, looking at public spaces, so office buildings, government office buildings, schools, medical facilities, justice centers, courthouses. I think we're going to have a shift to those projects and a big shift in public-private partnerships for those projects as local and state governments in particular, they're going to have budgetary constraints going forward, are going to try to find innovative ways of designing, building, financing those projects, and really trying to squeeze more efficiency out of them to make sure that we're going to have public facilities that are safe and operating in such a way that people feel comfortable going to them, but also appropriately maintained. So I'm going to see a shift from my prediction from what has just been transportation. Do anticipate strong transportation in the future, but more and more an increase in social infrastructure projects in the market. Like you said about the transport-heavy market, a lot of these are pretty multi-billion dollar projects. Do you think we'll start to see some smaller projects as maybe social projects drive the next generation? Absolutely. Social infrastructure, as you said, is just by nature tends to be smaller dollar amount because the building just don't cost nearly as much as a toll road or a transit system. That being said, though, there's significant investment that will be made over the life cycle of those projects, which is really the hallmark and the core of any good P3. You're looking at the full life cycle costing, the full cost ownership for that building. That's why you want to have these partnerships. But yeah, I definitely see in the near-term future, as we shift towards more social P3 projects, increased number of smaller projects that we haven't seen in the market here in the US. Still some of those multi-billion dollar transport projects, but more and more smaller, either single courthouses like you saw in Howard County, or bundling of projects, so maybe a grouping of schools in different places or police or fire facilities. I think we're going to get there. We're going to redefine economy of scale and we're going to redefine what a P3 means in the US into a more social infrastructure context. Definitely an increase in the smaller in the project, but there's an awful lot of opportunity there. If you think about the number of toll roads one could have in the United States, versus the number of facilities that are just waiting to be addressed due to maintenance backlog. So many more opportunities on that social side, and a lot of good that can be done there. I mean, we can deliver as an industry, as a P3 community, and deliver better facilities to address the needs and the changing needs of the populations that we're serving. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. So you mentioned courthouses and schools. Do you think that other government buildings such as, I mean, I know that there at OP3, you worked on the Henry J. Daly building project, which I know is in a bit of a stalemate, but then also things like libraries. Do you think those could come to market? Oh, absolutely. When you look at the model that you can apply using availability payment, where the public owner is going to make payments if that facility is available, and be maintained appropriate and operating in such a way that really meets all those goals of meeting the needs of the public in an environmentally sensitive way, you're going to see, yes, places like libraries. You mentioned the Daly building headquarters for governmental services. Definitely, I see a future where you're going to have more of a long-term relationship under a P3 or innovative project delivery model, where government says, all right, we want to lock in this relationship for 20, 30, maybe even more years to make sure that we're getting the best value for money, best value for the public's money out of this, and kind of going away from that model where you're going to have tendering and re-tendering of contracts over and over again for the same services in the building, and one where it's going to be that long-term relationship. And at least my prediction is we get more and more social projects. The industry will come to that because they'll realize that benefit. The public will come to that because they're going to realize the benefit when they have better facilities, better schools for their children to go to, better libraries for everyone to enjoy. And it's just going to be a way that we're going to be able to meet kind of the increasing demands we're going to have on our public spaces and the changing demands we're going to have on those public spaces. And we're going to have to do it all together. It's going to take real partnerships and real innovation, and that's a beauty of the market. And why I'm so excited to be here at BDO, where I truly believe we're going to be an opportunity to help those public owners and the private partners as well achieve that benefit for everyone. Seth, it's John Burke here. I had a question for you on that front. One of the bigger dust-ups in 2018 was Michigan's social labs projects, where there seemed to be a lot of dust-ups among the various agencies and ultimately led to that project getting shelved somewhat at a point where they had shortlisted bidders. Are you envisioning these next generations of social projects to be more procured in the sense of getting a progressive procurement in place to get everybody's sort of interests aligned? We are covering a couple of projects in that vein right now, like most notably Sepulveda out of LA, which is an LRT project. But on the social front, in talking to municipalities, is that sort of the approach they're looking to take for these potential projects? Yes, the answer I can tell you is yes. In speaking to different government and industry leaders, all in the innovative project delivery space, there's certainly an increased interest over the last year and 18 months in the progressive P3 model. And I think there's different names for it in different places. But where that relationship is evolving, it certainly allows for different off-ramps, if need be, if the project doesn't look like it's going to work out under that particular procurement model. But it allows for that growing relationship where it kind of goes through a bit of a discovery of what does the project really need, what are the best ways to move forward between the two parties. So to answer your question directly, yes, from what I've been hearing from leadership across the community within innovative project delivery, I do expect that we're going to see a greater utilization of that model, that procurement model, the progressive P3, quote, unquote, going forward. Now, we'll see how that works out. But I think you're right. I definitely agree that we'll see more of it. Great. Thanks. And then also from a technical aspect or point of view, I suppose, do you think that we'll see changes in design to some of these projects in terms of like air filtration and such as a result of COVID-19? Well, I'm certainly not an engineer or an expert on airflow or HVAC system. But yes, I think there's certainly going to be a re-examination, both on a regulatory side and just a community sense of, how much, how often is the air filtered or transferred out? Do we need to get to surgical levels? Who knows? I think we're still in a period of discovery on that of what the needs will be, what the right answer is. But yes, I think we're going to see going forward a renewed focus on the part of everyone about how air is controlled within buildings and how it is managed. I mean, it just stands to reason that that's going to be an outcome of what we're all living through right now. What is the condition of the air inside these facilities? And that is certainly going to play into any kind of project delivery. Under a P3, innovative project delivery, or any model, you can imagine the public interest in this resulting from our current situation. So yes, I think we're going to see a change. And what does that mean? Is there going to be different technologies that are going to be applied to this? I certainly hope so. And I hope that actually leads to some innovations in efficiency. Can we achieve the goals, the air quality levels within buildings that we're going to be demanding and do it in such a way that it can be effective and efficient both from a cost standpoint and an environment standpoint? But there are great firms out there that I've had the pleasure of working with and getting to know within the P3 space and the construction and operations space. And I imagine that they're all working on this very hard right now. Seth, John here again. There's obviously a couple social projects that we're actively covering right now, namely the Prince George's County School Bundle, which is nearing sort of the end of their procurement process. And then much earlier over in Oregon, we have Clackamas County and their courthouse. Are there any other projects that you're hearing out there that are sort of nearing the launch phase or in discovery phase that we should be aware of that fits within some of the things you're looking at? Unfortunately, I don't have any new news to report on that. I've heard a few things in the market, but nothing that is ready for public discussion just yet. But I can tell you from what I've heard on both sides, the public and the private side, that there is such an interest on the part of county and city governments. Similar to the counties you spoke about, looking at all, I guess you could call them sub-asset classes, so between schools, courthouses, looking at those kind of facilities, building on the success of a place like Howard County. And then, of course, in Canada with schools projects, trying to see where they can find that efficiency to meet budgetary needs, but also delivering better facilities. So nowhere I can point just yet, but I can tell you that there is certainly more interest in the social space than I have seen in all my years in this field. Yeah, to your point, I guess, Abby, we'd heard, right, that there was another bundle budgeted within Prince George's County behind the ones that were, the project that's currently out there being procured. So there's more in the pipeline there. And obviously, yes, to your point in Canada, Alberta is building schools through P3 as well. So yeah, it's a very active space. That's right. Well, Seth, thank you so much for joining us this morning. It's been a pleasure talking to you and hearing what you have to say about the market. Well, thank you all so very much. It's a pleasure to be speaking to you today. Really appreciate it. And thank you for having me and BDO. And hopefully, I get to speak to you again. Thanks again, Seth. And now turning it over to you, JB, what can we expect out of next week's conference? Thanks, Abby. And great to have Seth on the program today. Yes, next week, we do have our annual P3 conference. Once delayed, but finally here. It'll be all virtual, obviously. And we have a bunch of sessions lined up, which we think will interest hopefully both the public and private side of things. Just wanted to highlight a couple of sessions where we just kind of recently formalized our panels. Actually, closing out this conference is kind of a new panel that we created called Climate Change. And we're looking at sort of the impact of climate change on infrastructure. We are covering an active project that's going on in sort of resiliency out there called Fargo-Moorhead as sort of one of the drivers for this. But also, we have other projects out there that are currently in different stages of feasibility, such as something that's being conducted with Miami-Dade right now. So chairing the panel this year will be Alan Marks of Milbank. We also welcome Fermin Fontanes from the executive director of the Puerto Rico P3 Authority. Scott Jacobs, who was a keynote speaker actually at our IFF conference this year, he'll be on that panel as well. Barry Gold from Marathon Capital. Jennifer Chang from Moody's, who is a senior analyst. And also very excited by this guest here, Noon Tara Key, who is the deputy director of climate resilience for the governor's office of planning and research for California. Very, very interested to hear what she has to say on the topic, given how very active and often California is in leading climate change and the movement towards clean energy. So that will be closing the panel on Tuesday, October 6. That panel will be at 2.45. So at 4 o'clock to close day one, we have a panel discussion labeled is fixed price contracting a broken model? Investors in the P3 space will understand that this is how P3 contracts are usually modeled around the fixed price contract. However, there has been some negative developments in the industry as of late in the US and Canada, namely Denver canceling the Great Hall P3 contract at the Denver International Airport, which they had to re-procure as a design build. Hamilton, Ontario canceling their LRT project. And then finally, most recently, essentially the Maryland Transit Authority, or MTA, having to come to a decision soon about what they're going to do with the Purple Line, given that both the contractors and equity investors are trying to get out of their contract currently and what the MTA is going to do there. So speaking on this panel, or chairing this panel, excuse me, is Raymond DeFrenzio of SNBC, Frank Sasser, interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation, Colin Pappard, senior director for the LA Office of Innovation for LA Metro, Trevor DeLeavis, senior director of infrastructure ratings for S&P Global Ratings. Also joining the panel recently was Dan Stabenhagen, executive vice president for engineering, bidding, and business development for Lane Corporate Construction, and Jensen Clark, VP of business development for Fengate. So we hope you'll be able to join these panels and others. Again, to repeat, chairing, opening the keynote presentation will be Dr. Gunalan, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. So again, hope you guys can join us. More information can be found on our events page on information. That's it for me, Abby. All right, great. Thanks, JB, and thanks everyone for listening in, and JB, for giving me this opportunity. Bye, y'all.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-09-22 17:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### GIP executive discuss infra credit\n**Episode ID:** 4437\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to this month's edition of Information's Crossroads podcast. I'm John Burke, America's editor. After a brief summer hiatus, we are back at it. And to be honest, readers of our news wire service can attest, there is a lot to talk about. One development was the continued rise of infrastructure credit as an asset class, as Carlisle and I-squared publicly announced debt platforms with investors to invest in the sector. Infrastructure credits find themselves in a gigantic window of opportunity. But questions linger as to what degree they're going to take advantage of it. Industry experts point to tightening bank regulations pre-COVID as one catalyst. But as 2020 nears its fourth quarter, other elements have surfaced, including public money drying up in the face of COVID, where normally states can rely on taxes to back projects, renewable projects seeking new debt instruments as tax equity dries up, and increased demand in private placements, which have traditionally backed projects with longer tenor. Global Infrastructure Partners has a debt platform equipped to handle deals of all shapes and sizes, as its spectrum platform targets secured financings for contracted assets. Second platform, Capital Solutions, targets higher yielding opportunities, including projects with CapEx and construction risk. Here to talk about all of these issues is Jennifer Powers, chair of the credit team, and Rainer Bohning, a partner in the group. Guys, thanks for joining the program today. Thanks for having us. Great. So just to start off, if you guys could talk a little bit about what sectors that both platforms have historically targeted and why they've targeted it. Sure, I'll kick that off. And then I'll let Rainer riff on some of the market themes that we're seeing. As you may be aware, GIP has very defined sectors that we specialize in based on the breadth of our platform experience as a pure play infrastructure manager. And they are energy, which is broadly defined to include midstream and downstream, as well as conventional power and renewables, where we define conventional power to exclude coal and nuclear. We also look at assets in the transportation space, which includes for us everything ranging from airports, ports, rolling stock, logistics assets, and the like. And our smallest sector is water and waste. And in all of these, we look globally. We're a global focused family of funds based on dollarized loans. And we have an opportunity to participate in a small bucket of non-OECD countries' infrastructure projects as well. Rainer, do you want to just share some of your views on what we're seeing in those sectors? Yeah, sure, I can do that. And in general, just to expand a little bit on what Jennifer was saying, we do traffic up and down the capital structure. So in the sectors that Jennifer mentioned, we basically deploy anything from preferred or structured equity to sub-debt, holding company debt, to firstly, insecure financing. A lot of our activity historically and today continues to center around construction financing, be that in the context of Greenfield or in the context of an issue of trying to build an additional expansion to the existing asset base. So that's an area where we feel we have a real competitive angle, given the breadth of the GIP platform, and in particular, our operating team. The other aspect or the other parts of the value chain where we're really active today is in the context of refinancings for companies that maybe have suffered certain credit events in the last 6 to 12 months, partly as a result of COVID, and maybe under ratings pressure. And for those companies, we can provide flexible liquidity or refinancing capital to really bridge through this period of challenges. And so those are, I think, the two most critical areas of focus for us right now. Yeah, appreciate that. I was going to ask you guys how COVID-19 has changed your approach. Rainer, you do mention refinancing as one area. Has there been other areas where you've seen an increased demand for your type of product? Yeah, and COVID has been interesting. And I think there's sort of different phases. If I think about the phase right after the lockdown, which for us sort of happened in early March, and I'm sure for other people as well, from early March through, I'd say, May, the opportunity set was really very much dominated by a complete dislocation in the capital markets, lack of access to really any form of capital, many companies in our target sectors looking for near-term liquidity, and or trying to address upcoming refinancing maturities very proactively. And so that three-month period really saw a lot of opportunistic sort of deal flow. And in addition, we also saw, and this is one of the areas that we can focus on as well, is some secondary opportunities with many of the loans in the midstream sector, for example, or the power sector, having traded down quite significantly and trading at substantial discounts to power value. And so we evaluated a whole host of those kinds of situations. After the Fed stepped in and really provided unprecedented liquidity, in particular to the high-yield market, the tone in the markets changed dramatically. And when you look at the activity in the capital markets today, it's really 180 degrees from where it was in March and April. So the spigot is open, and most of the companies that were looking for alternative private capital early in the lockdown are now not under that kind of pressure anymore. So it's a different fact pattern, given the overall tone in the markets. For us, that really has meant that a lot of the self-transactional opportunistic deal flow has fallen by the wayside, and we're back to our core business, which is really centered around fundamentally financing infrastructure businesses for their CapEx needs. We see some acquisition activity and acquisition financing activity, and just goals-oriented financings. And geographically, it's been really mostly America-driven. So a lot of Southern Cone, Mexico. We've done investments in Colombia and Uruguay, and we've been quite active here in the US as well. I would just chime in on that, John, to say that the other aspect of COVID impact that is worth highlighting is, as Rainer indicated, we're kind of back to our fundamental strategy in our regular way of blocking and tackling and serving the needs of borrowers who, frankly, are not able to access bank capital or more liquid forms of term loan B or bond market capital as a function of a whole host of issues, ranging from deal size being too small for perceived liquidity in those markets, not being rated, not having a significant fee wallet share for banks to pay attention to. There's a lot of reasons why borrowers in our space may not be able to tap into that very low-cost capital, despite what we've seen the Fed do to bolster liquidity. So again, back to the fundamental strategy, which you mentioned at the outset, driven by shifts since the great financial crisis in terms of how banks and traditional sources of capital price their capital. I would say that the other significant impact from our perspective to the opportunity set that we're looking at is we have a fundamental view that the COVID impact globally, and certainly in the Americas, will continue to have a long tail on impact. And as such, we continue to look for opportunities that will be resilient through a long-term recovery. And all things being equal, I would say that our ideal borrower is someone who's looking for that proverbial capital solution and that we can work with to customize the right credit package while giving them the liquidity they need and providing us with the downside protection that we need to weather the next two, three, four, five years. Great, appreciate that. So in terms of greenfield developments, how do you envision infrastructure credit funds playing in this particular field? And I know we talked about P3s before we came on the program, but I'm talking about that in terms of a broader overview of just infrastructure development and greenfield opportunities. Is there an opportunity for infrastructure credit funds, or do you think it's still not space for you guys? Absolutely. I mean, that's our bread and butter. When we think about what our value add is to an infrastructure borrower who is embarking on a CapEx growth plan, a brownfield expansion, whatever that kind of spade in the ground looks like, that's where we can add a tremendous amount of value. And that's really a function of our unique structure at GIP where we have a very deep operating team with decades, decades, decades of experience in helping manage complex infrastructure projects from cradle to maturity and optimization. And on the equity side of our house, that has really been about optimizing performance of those assets to achieve better upside returns. And on the credit side of the house, we take that same team and are able to deploy that knowledge base to help us craft more thoughtful, better downside protections and work with borrowers to grapple with risks and issues that, frankly, may not be issues and risks that banks and other capital providers are comfortable with. So we think we're uniquely positioned to provide that type of value add support to infrastructure borrowers. But certainly, more broadly within the infrastructure credit space, our competitors are also willing to grapple with some of those risks, perhaps not all, because they don't have the same type of operating team that we do. But that is a natural type of transaction for infrastructure credit funds. Great. I noticed that you pointed out Latin America earlier, which we've actually covered in information. Can you talk about how you guys approach the Latin American market, particularly how, say, national policy plays into the decision-making process? And if you could just talk a little bit about your investment thesis there. Yeah, so as Jennifer mentioned at the outset, we are primarily focused on OCD countries with a small sort of carve-out, if you will, for non-OCD jurisdictions. So if you think about the OCD countries in Latin America, you're basically talking about Mexico, Chile, Colombia now. And those are all countries where we have been very active historically and currently, both on the equity as well as on the debt side. And then as you sort of venture outside the OCD jurisdictions, we tend to focus on countries that essentially have very stable quasi-investment-grade or explicitly investment-grade credit profiles. So Uruguay is a good example there. And for us as a credit provider, it's obviously paramount to make sure that we invest in a jurisdiction that has a pretty stable underlying jurisdictional environment and the ability to exercise your rights if that ever was necessary. In terms of the projects that we tend to focus on, we tend to focus on projects that have a lot of economic multiplier effects and commercial viability. So what do I mean by that? When you look at our two most recent transactions in Latin America, we've done a second lien financing for a trade rail PPP in Uruguay. And we have provided a holding company term loan for a greenfield built out of a port in Colombia. So in both of those situations, the underlying projects are of significant economic development benefit to the underlying regions and countries. In Uruguay, the trade rail that's being built is operating on a long-term concession provided by the Uruguayan government. It is basically providing a trade rail link from a multi-billion dollar port project that's being built in central Uruguay to Montevideo. And once up and running, it will be a not insignificant contributor to the overall GDP of the country. So that's a good fact panel for us. And the concession that's been provided by the Uruguayan government is exceptionally strong. And then the underlying financing here is being provided by the Inter-American Development Bank. And we personally, as well as institutionally, have an exceptionally good relationship with the Inter-American Development and other multilateral agencies. And take a not insignificant amount of comfort from the fact that the IADB is a lender to this project, has been betting the project for a significant amount of time, and in some cases, years. And almost feel like it provides a certain degree of political risk insurance just by virtue of the fact that the IADB, Inter-American Development Bank, is a lender to this project. So those kinds of factors, so a very strong alignment of incentives between us and the concession provider, a standalone commercial viability of the underlying project, and then strong partners that we can team up with. Those are all factors that play very, very prominently in our decision-making process. And I could basically apply that same sort of pattern that I just described to the port financing we did in Colombia, where the IADB, the Inter-American Development Bank, was also the underlying project finance provider, had been evaluating the project for the better part of two years. And interestingly, that project was the first project in the history of the IADB that scored a perfect 10 out of 10 on both the economic impact scale as well as on commercial viability scale. So it's those kinds of high-value opportunities where we can bring our greenfield construction expertise to bear and really team up with these kinds of providers that are very critical to us. Excellent. Thank you. Circling back to the US, we're about six weeks removed from a federal election coming up. Just wondering if you guys are seeing anything in the tea leaves right now, in terms of the infrastructure plans being promoted through both candidates, that you believe could lead to a more unified federal infrastructure policy. Certainly curious to hear your views on this. As I mentioned before we started the show, Reiner and I were comparing notes on that. And I think we were a little reluctant to make predictions. But I think one of the things when we think about the current administration that puzzled a lot of people in the early days, the first 100 days, if you will, was that the Trump administration didn't undertake what should have been a win-win bipartisan effort around infrastructure. Because that should be motherhood and apple pie. Everybody can agree that it needs to be dealt with. But there were different priorities around health care and tax reform, which obviously took up a lot of time and political energy. I mean, I haven't seen anything yet that impresses me that anyone has a really thought out actual plan to deliver to the Congress February 6. But I think it continues to be an absolute truism that whoever wins the White House in November should have a broad-based mandate to really be creative and thoughtful in an economy that needs not a small kick in the pants from a fiscal standpoint, since we're, quite frankly, running out of tools in the toolkit on monetary policy. So I think the time has come, by virtue of COVID, the economic cycle, whatever pick your poison you want to point a finger at. And I would certainly hope that we would see the opportunity to advance that ball nationally. What it looks like compared to the experiences in mainland Europe, the UK, Canada, anyplace else, again, isn't clear to me. But I think it's overdue. And while that's not an area that we think that our current price tag of capital is necessarily going to be effective, given the likely government support that would go along with any concession or sale of assets, it's something that we're going to keep a very close eye on. And the other thing that clearly is we alluded to at the onset is these things do take time to move forward. So even if someone marches into Congress early in the new administration and says, this is what we're going to do, it takes a lot of rubber on the road to actually get something to be actionable. So I'm not personally holding my breath, but I think it's timely. You asked about the importance of Greenfield. And the irony is that, other than the renewable sector, the sectors where we probably need the most Greenfield or construction capital are the sectors that will be covered as part of an infrastructure bill. And so you're thinking about water and waste, you're thinking about toll roads, bridges, things like that. And the irony is that, absent a real mandate and something that really incentivizes capital providers like ourselves to deploy capital, it is unclear to me, at least, to what extent that actually will materialize. And so that's the sad part of it. Yeah, I mean, the final thought I'd leave with you on this is that, if anything, from those early days when there was an infrastructure plan being carved in the White House in 2018, if anything from that launching point, and that was sort of in the first quarter, the universe of investors has expanded even. So at the very least, to your point, Jennifer, of it taking time, at the very least, I'm saying again, is that there's a lot of people that are ready to deploy capital to work when the time comes. And so on that note, Ryan or Jennifer, I thank you so much for coming on the program. And we'll hope to speak to you again soon. Awesome. Thanks for having us. And we look forward to continuing the dialogue as we move forward into what we hope is a brave new world. Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you. And so very nuanced views on the election from the GIP team, we switch over to the USP3 conference, which is finally at hand virtually on October 5th and 6th, where we are going to present two full days, usually with stuff that you'll see from P3, but you'll have to watch it through the screen. So our keynote speaker, just to be clear, will be the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Dr. Gunalan. And then we have a loaded opening panel, as always, chaired by Doug Fried of Norton Rose, including Marcus Lemon, now of the US Department of Energy, Naraya Hathawagar of ACS North America, Sandeep Gopalan of Macquarie, Morteza Farajan, executive director of the Build America Bureau. Before we talk about the rest of the slate, I wanted to make mention to you of a newer addition to the program this year is our market sounding lectures, which are going to be given on at least three distinct programs, possibly a fourth. For now, you're going to hear Rick Mead, executive officer of LA Metro, talking about their massive LRT expansion plans. And my colleague, Abby Miller, will get into that in a little bit, as well as John Hebert of the Georgia Department of Transportation and discussing the mobile mobility program down in Georgia. And finally, coming from PennDOT, we will hear from Michael Benigni, director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, talking about his looming project there, the IV-1. So we hope we'll join you for that. You can find more information on our website about the agenda. So just to give you a little flavor of what we're going to be talking about, Abby, thank you for joining us today. Yeah, thanks for having me. We have a busy fall and possibly an even busier 2021, depending on, of course, how the tea leaves go. We're obviously not in uncertain times concerning both the economy and how COVID's going to affect the economy. But nevertheless, we have seen states and universities, they're not waiting for federal policy to dictate what they're going to do. They're going out and searching for their own projects. The DOTs naturally have led the way. And it's why I think you're seeing a lot of the market soundings emanating from them, but also universities and other municipalities. So Abby, why don't you just give us a little bit of what we can expect in terms of these procurement processes over the second half of the year? Yeah, so this is obviously far from all of the projects. That would take much longer than the promised 30 minutes to go through. But a couple of the projects that we're going to see hopefully advance through the rest of the year, you mentioned LA Metro. There's the Sebulveda Pass project. The RFP responses have been returned and they expect to award the contract sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Of course, that is just the first part of an extensive project. So even if the preferred proponent is announced before the end of the year, it will probably be quite a while before they reach financial close. Also in California, in San Francisco, they just launched the Potrero Bus Yard project. And RFQs for that will be due on October 15. Coming a little further east, there's the two major Miami projects that are part of the SMART plan. The Miami-Dade Dolphin Stadium Transit Oriented Development Project, RFPs were returned so they could pick a preferred proponent and award the contract for the end of the year. And the Miami Beach Trunkline P3, they expect the contract award by the end of the year. There's also the North Carolina Rural Broadband Project, which that one has an asterisk by it because we're not 100% sure it's going P3. They're doing kind of a dual procurement process where they're looking at design, build, and P3. However, if they go to P3 route, or I suppose regardless, they expect to pick a preferred proponent and announce that in October. Another couple of asterisks, over the summer in Hawaii, the Aloha Stadium received responses to the RFP and have the preferred proponent expected by the end of the year. Also, the HART P3 project, the Rapid Transit Project, the preferred proponent is supposed to be selected before the end of the year. Those, like I said, both have kind of an asterisk by them because there has been a little bit of local news that has suggested that one or both of those projects may not end up moving forward as quickly, but as far as we know that they are going to. And then, of course, I have to mention the I-995 Capital Beltway project. That project is supposed to see the final RFP issued in December of this year. And as anyone who's been following it knows that's quite a long time coming. Yeah, and just to be specific for our readers and our listeners, both the Capital Beltway, which is phase one, again, of a very much elongated project, and Sepulveda, the proponent selection is just merely the beginning of a process there. I mean, they're going to select a proponent and then they're going to negotiate on proper design and CapEx. And all that's going to, no ditch is going to be dug, we think, in 2021 concerning these projects or possibly towards the end of it. But there's obviously that intermediate step of developing the project and sorting it out with the municipal officials about getting the proper CapEx in place. And for Sepulveda, Sepulveda, that's under a progressive contract, which is how it's being procured. And it seems like phase one of the Capital Beltway might be similar there. Anyway, either way, it's certainly a lot of things to talk about heading into the fall season. And we look forward to everyone joining us online for the virtual USP3 2020. Abby, thanks for coming onto the program today. And we'll look forward to hearing from you guys next time around. Brook out.

Today I'm your host, Matt O'Brien, news editor for our North America coverage. Today I thought it'd be interesting to talk about broadband infrastructure, which we've all heard during the COVID pandemic. We've heard from public officials talk about bringing certain projects online to widen access to distance learning, telemedicine, other applications, similar applications, and generally improving people's access to broadband as they work from home during the pandemic. We've also heard from investors and operators about their bullish case for the hardware that underpins broadband services, fiber and wireless networks. Today to help me explore those issues in greater detail, we've asked Sebastian Caputo of John Lang and Su Li of EY to be guests on today's podcast. Sebastian is an investment director with John Lang Infrastructure Investors. He leads the digital infrastructure investment platform in North America. Prior to that, he was part of the global communications and infrastructure investment banking team at RBC, covering each of the various sectors, including fiber, data infrastructure, and mobile wireless. Su is a managing director with Ernst & Young Infrastructure Advisors, where she provides strategic and financial advice to public agencies on P3s and other alternative delivery methods. She advised, in fact, she advised the Georgia DOT on its broadband project. With that, I would like to get into some questions I have for you guys. Sebastian, I wanted to start with you. I wanted you to discuss the different types of broadband platforms and how they fit within the digital infrastructure landscape. Great. Well, Matt, thank you so much for having me, and Su, great to be on this podcast panel with you. With that question, I think it's best to help first understand the broader digital infrastructure industry landscape, which includes bandwidth infrastructure, which effectively is fiber, data infrastructure, and mobile wireless infrastructure. Each one of those sectors has subsectors with their own investment characteristics in them. And taking those in reverse order, the mobile wireless infrastructure sector includes macro towers, outdoor small cells, and or wireless networks, and the latter being something that we're starting to see a lot more attention to, identification spectrum requirements, put a lot more attention on them. And then data infrastructure includes hyperscale wholesale data centers, retail co-location, and hybrid co-location and managed services, as well as pure cloud. And then bandwidth infrastructure includes long-haul fiber, middle-mile networks. A lot of those are oftentimes embedded with dark fiber-type contracts. You also have regional network operators, predominantly focused on enterprise connectivity, so we're starting to see them address a lot more of the wireless carrier, wholesale carrier needs. And then we're also starting to see fiber to the premise, fiber to the home, as some other folks call it, mass focus more on discrete markets and municipalities, with a large component focused on residential customers and small to medium-sized businesses. And on that last one, we're starting to see that come into the U.S. more in focus, and you would say that Europe probably has a lot more of a history over the past few years of fiber to the home, fiber to the premise-type investment platforms. And in taking the high-level approach, looking at those subsectors, a decade ago, these digital infrastructure sectors were part of the same industry universe, but were a large degree separate industries with distinct underlying operational and investment characteristics. But over time, these sectors have become more intertwined, both operationally and from a customer provisioning perspective, and focusing specifically on bandwidth infrastructure, which, again, is primarily fiber at this moment, is the key asset that clues each of the digital infrastructure sectors. It's by far the best medium for transport of data packets versus what we're seeing, albeit more economically, like fixed wireless, satellite, or perhaps cable HFC plants, and of course, much better than traditional legacy copper DSL-type provisionings. Fiber connects enterprises, data centers, towers, small cells, indoor facilities, which could be anything from commercial buildings to multi-dwelling units, convention centers, arenas, and more recently in the U.S., starting to connect residences. And if we look at how fiber interplays with the other subsectors, we look at data centers. Data centers, for example, they're not going to be very useful unless they have, you know, multiple high-quality dense fiber network connectivity with diverse entry, egress, ingress points. And we're seeing a lot of demand for hyperscalers for fiber assets looking to connect their data center footprints, which they typically do via dark fiber IRUs. And then on the macro tower side, the mobile wireless infrastructure side, we're seeing wireless carriers continue to move away from wireless backhaul to fiber-to-the-tower deployments, and mostly on a dark fiber basis, albeit we do see carriers contract with third-party fiber operators on a live basis. And we're starting to see, as network topologies advance, we're starting to see a lot more front-haul connectivity for C-RAN architecture. And small cells are part of the network densification build-out, which itself is mostly fiber. And the same thing with indoor network solutions, and that addresses public safety networks, Wi-Fi solutions, as well as just broader carrier distributed antenna systems, and now we're starting to see private networks of CBRS. All of these digital infrastructure verticals require fiber in order to operate at its basic operational level. And so, you know, as investors look at the entire sector, there certainly has been evolution as they've gone from each of the different subsectors. And now, you know, more recently, fiber has been a core focus of theirs, given the underpinnings of how it's intertwined with all the other different subsectors. So that's kind of the high-level viewpoint, industry landscape, and hopefully that conveys the importance that we think, the ultimate importance in intertwining of fiber across each of those elements. Yeah, no, that's great. That's helpful and a good way to start the discussion. Sue, I want to turn to you, and, you know, given your role at EY and working with public agencies, what role do public agencies play in delivering digital projects, and what are their goals? And as a follow-up to that, is there any opportunity for P3 delivery of these projects? Sure, Joe. Thanks for having me. I mean, I think that the roles that public agencies play are probably incredibly broad and nuanced, but there are three key roles that I think are of interest to this audience, and that I see really emerging, especially in the current context. You know, so first is permitting authority, you know, for laying large corridors or fiber or even short ones, depending on who the landowners are. I think public agencies are critical as the grantors of permits, licenses, easements to private parties so that they can actually get onto land to install the fiber or wireless equipment. And, you know, the goals here are really to enable broadband expansion and coverage in their jurisdictions, to enable private business, and to support the community of constituents that needs that asset. Second key role is just as consumers and end users of this digital infrastructure. As you can imagine, public agencies have a lot of data needs themselves that they are using to run their departments, to transfer information, and they also need to provide reliable service to their users. So, you know, I was happy to see that Amtrak is really allowing me to have wireless coverage in their tunnels now, and that kind of service on major transit corridors really enables better productivity for their users. But as we start to see, you know, changes in technology of our infrastructure that's not directly on the highways or transit networks, but are really about like connected and automated vehicles, these agencies are going to need to actually use and enable much more data on their corridors. So, they are buyers of the infrastructure as well, and they're going to have to keep pace with this moving technology. But a third really important role and goal is to really carry out bigger picture policy initiatives. So, as we're seeing in the COVID world, the fiber and wireless technology is not just a nice to have, but an absolute must have for business, for social connectivity, for education. And so, I think at the executive levels of state and local governments, there is a mandate to more of their departments to figure out ways to bridge that digital divide between, you know, access at income levels and between the rural and the urban. And, you know, is there an opportunity for P3? I think yes, there definitely is. How can that be accessed is going to really depend on the ways in which public agencies are structuring their projects. You know, I'm sure that folks might be thinking about some of the recent projects such as Pennsylvania Turnpike, Kentucky Wired, the Georgia Broadband Project, which is, you know, on pause, but I think hopefully we're going to resume that soon. You know, and I think that they're asking like, is this the right model? Will it work? And I think that there are ways in which it can work, but it really depends on how much flexibility public agencies can use in their procurement strategies and how they can actually engage with a market that does contracting and delivery in a very different way than some of the DOTs or transit agencies might typically do it. And so, you know, I've had a few observations that might be a good launching point for discussion with Sebastian on this, which is that, you know, broadband sector is doing fine without the public agency stepping in through P3s. It's not like a toll road. You know, these are assets that the public sector has been delivering on their own, and the way that they do business is very different. I'm not sure that they see a huge incentive to change so far. You know, the key market players might not want to engage in the public procurement process. And also, the idea of there being like a fixed scope that enables low-cost bidding evaluation might be challenging when you've got so many different business models that the operators are using. For some operators, fiber is their focus. Others, wireless. Some, both. And so, you know, how do you develop a project that enables clear, fair, transparent procurement, but also get to a very unique structure? You know, and that's kind of the nut that we as an industry need to work together to crack in order for deals to flourish. Great. Sebastian, did you want to add to that or? Yeah, I think obviously Sue made some awesome points there, all very relevant. I pretty much agree with everything she covered there. You know, the vast majority of opportunities in the space are within the private sector. As Sue mentioned, PPP programs are more difficult in the broadband space, in part because commercialization opportunities in the market are very market-specific. In terms of advancing the goal of minimizing the digital divide, there has been success in incentivizing network build-outs in rural areas via direct federal and state sub-state programs. Those programs effectively defray the private operator's build-out costs and makes the investment economically viable where it otherwise wouldn't be. You know, the idea that the private operator will evaluate all potential lease-up opportunities off the network is better set in that direct subsidy program, and they can then plug in the hole with government subsidies to make it economically viable. You know, that solution has worked in many cases. Understanding that each of the states have a whole bunch of different assets they feel like they can leverage and perhaps, you know, enjoy some of the uplift of commercialization opportunities where a private operator jumps onto their physical assets, it becomes pretty difficult because you're trying to kind of shoehorn, you know, a network topography when it might not really marry with the commercialization opportunities a private operator would be able to pursue. But if you're able to give them direct subsidies, then they are able to leverage state assets where they can and then also pursue the private right-of-way route, permit route, and then figure out their own kind of network topology on their own. But there could be some PPP programs that could work, but it's just not going to be, in my view, you know, the main down-the-fairway means of getting the rural areas connected if that's the goal. And then, yeah, so that's – I don't want to be too harsh on PPPs with regards to broadband. There could be some successful opportunities there, but otherwise, I think direct federal and state subsidies might be the better course of action. Understood. Gotcha. Sebastian, I want to stick with you here for a second. How digital infrastructure investors view broadband investment opportunities? As opposed to, you know, public involvement, looking more at digital infrastructure investors and their involvement with, you know, building out these different network programs. You know, over the past decade, the investment community began to view these tower data centers and fiber assets through the infrastructure lens. The investor base has shifted from traditional private equity to infrastructure funds and now includes direct investments by infrastructure fund LPs. These are the pension funds, insurance funds, sovereign wealth funds. And part of this investor shift is a result of the core plus infrastructure investment profile of taking on more risk for greater return. But part of this is acceptance of digital infrastructure as a more stable and steady industry that is more mission critical to our daily lives and becoming less and less discretionary. The world's recent COVID experience has only accelerated these elements as our reliance on digital infrastructure has deemed it to be an essential service and almost a quasi-utility alongside water, electricity, gas. You know, and it first started with macro towers in terms of private investors coming in and shifting from traditional private equity to infrastructure investors. And not coincidentally, macro towers was the first subsector to secure REIT status as well. Kind of another element highlighting, you know, it's more real estate, more asset, more infrastructure-like characteristics. And then within macro towers specifically, these vertical steel assets attached to the ground with operators securing long-term contracts with high credit quality wireless customers was going to be the first shoot a drop in terms of long-term infrastructure investors and then institutional investors coming in. Next was the wholesale data centers and hyperscale customers with the same type of customer contract characteristics. You would have long-term contracts, strong credit quality, you know, as opposed to a Verizon and AT&T and T-Mobile, you know, these hyperscalers of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, where you can kind of pierce through the contract veil and underwrite underlying credit quality of those customers. And now, as the infrastructure investors, you know, have continued to go down to different subsectors of digital infrastructure, they're now a few years into evaluating fiber platforms, especially those fiber platforms supporting large enterprise connectivity, data center connectivity, fiber-to-the-tower, government E-rate. Investors are essentially looking for the same or similar characteristics on the investment side that attracted them first to towers and then to data centers. I mean, just to highlight a few of the investment characteristics that infrastructure funds and other long-term institutional investors are looking for is essentially revenue visibility, strong market demand, score bookings and top-line growth, sticky customer base, low churn, strong counterparty credit quality, perhaps diversification across customer verticals and service offerings, high stabilized margins and high operating leverage with high incremental flow-through margin percentages, a high level of long-lived asset ownership, and perhaps an opportunity for expansion catbacks and success-based catbacks with short payback periods and high ROICs, and then just generally favorable competitive dynamics. And so that's kind of the holy grail, the holy bible of the different facets of what investors are looking for. And we're starting to see each of these subsectors starting to exhibit a lot of these characteristics. And that's, I would say that as the investor community starts to get pretty saturated, you know, it started with towers and then hyperscale customers, they continue to go down the list in finding more infrastructure characteristics in each of the different subsectors, or at least are willing to take on some of those subsectors that don't have the highest level at each one of those investment characteristics I mentioned. But that's kind of the evolution of where we are today. And now I think it'd be very difficult for any infrastructure investor to claim that digital infrastructure isn't, you know, part of a core focus or something they're looking to evaluate getting into. All right, great. Sue, I want to turn to you. How can, getting back to the public sector, how can governments better structure P3 programs or other non-P3 structures to incentivize investments across the states? I think that, you know, going back to Sebastian's earlier point on rural broadband, you know, there's probably a couple ways to think about where the digital infrastructure kind of assets lie. I mean, there are some that are going to be commercially attractive and, you know, generate a lot of potential revenue for the private sector. So, you know, there's probably less work that governments need to do to intervene there and incentivize investment. And then for the less commercially attractive areas, which are, you know, primarily the broad, the rural areas, I mean, let's face it, there's a reason why the rural areas are not covered right now sufficiently. And it's just because the private market does not think that they can make, you know, sufficient revenue off of that. And so, if we consider broadband, fiber, or wireless to be an essential asset, as essential as power or water or postal service, the government's going to need to help create that market through subsidized programs where, you know, they're really taking on that revenue risk through some kind of guarantee or, you know, being an anchor tenant and creating that market so that the private investment will flow. And eventually, you know, as those areas become more commercially viable, I think that the public subsidies can get weaned off. But I think that's the initial step, you know, for the more commercially attractive areas. I think it's really possible for public agencies to think hard about the deal structuring. I mean, when you think about the classic, you know, fiber type of deal, what people are going to operators asking for is, you know, you design the network, you build it for me, you bring in your own capital, we'll put in some capital ourselves too, and then you operate it and maintain it at a certain level of service. So, design, build, finance, operate, maintain are embedded into that structure. And I think that, you know, I keep kind of brainstorming on this, but if the public agencies approach that more like a standard IRU contract and went to the providers to really think about how they structure those elements into something that's both compliant with procurement policies, meets public, you know, infrastructure goals, and actually enables and incentivizes, you know, the commercialization, I think that there's a solution there. And I'm optimistic because, you know, when you think about the early P3s of our more traditional civil infrastructure sector in that early phase, there were hiccups there. Not every project was a success. There have been bankruptcies. And so, I think when we look at this sector, it may not be perfect in terms of its implementation, but eventually we'll be able to work together, you know, as public agencies with private sector partners to get it right and to get to a deal structure that works. Okay. Thank you for that. Sebastian, I'm not sure if you want to contribute to that, or if you guys, you know, we're going to start to wind it down here, if you guys have any last thoughts before we sign off. No, I think I would just say that, you know, I totally agree with Sue. The global recognition of the importance of digital infrastructure is now, without a doubt, you know, widely accepted, right? So, everybody understands, it's been accelerated by the COVID experience, how important connectivity is across the board. And, you know, connectivity and performance of experience has commercialization impact, has also educational impact nowadays. I was mentioning, so Amazon or anybody else can tell you, in terms of overall latency experienced by an end user has a direct impact on, you know, their sales, for example. And so, with regards to children and their education, Zoom, learning from home, for example, any type of asymmetric, you know, issues compromise the quality of their educational experience. And, you know, that happens professionally as well, but certainly with children can be more distracted if they don't have the ability to continuously receive, you know, the teacher's feedback, guidance, whatever it might be, or their ability to kind of upload their own image and discussion points. It's not going to be a great experience all the way around. So, the need for top quality connectivity on a symmetric basis is important, and that's not just fiber, but it also requires greater, you know, data infrastructure, storage capacity, you know, compute capacity, bringing it closer to the end customers, perhaps people calling it edge computing, for example. And then, in addition to that, having that experience you're getting from your home, your desk, perhaps even your office on a kind of mobile basis, right, being able to take a call outside, enter a building, perhaps even go through your elevator into your office, it makes a big deal. And right now, we're not even close to that, right? But we're going to get there, and it's going to take investment. It's going to take investment in physical fiber access, investment in the basic servers that fill up data centers. It's going to take, you know, investment within spectrum with regards to, you know, wireless connectivity, both outside and indoor, within indoor facilities. So, any investor in the space is certainly kind of licking their chops seeing how they can be part of this overall expansion for what is starting to become more mission critical, more essential infrastructure need. So, I would just leave it at that, and I cannot fault any of the states for wanting to, you know, incentivize and facilitate greater build-outs for their own constituents. It's just a better lifestyle, and it helps, you know, foment more economic activity. One thing I wanted to say is I think that the public sector would welcome partnership with the private sector on this question of what can we do to incentivize you to make this an easier process for growth of these assets, because my clients are very focused on future planning, right? It takes a long time for public sector to build assets out, you know, at a big scale, which is what a lot of these departments are charged to do. And so, they're not only thinking about all those really, like, critical day-to-day functions that Sebastian mentioned that we are, you know, living right now, but they're really thinking about what's going to happen 10 years from now or 20 years from now. DOTs are definitely thinking, obviously, about, you know, the highways and CAVs, but municipalities are thinking about how are people going to be living in another 10, 15 to 20 years? Their planning cycles are that far out. So, they do understand the criticality of expansion of fiber and broadband, and they're going to be really very motivated to use their political investment in growing this field. And I think that that's really my kind of optimistic spin on it. I appreciate that. I want to thank our guests, Sebastian and Sue, for taking time to join us today and going into finer details about broadband investments. And I'd like to thank our audience for listening in. That wraps up this month's edition of Crossroads Podcast.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-07-20 16:08:21+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Interview with Apollo Infra’s co-head Geoff Strong\n**Episode ID:** 4439\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the latest edition of the Crossroads podcast. I'm John Burke, Americas Editor with Information. Joining me this morning is Jeff Strong, Senior Partner and Co-Ed of Apollo Global Management's Infrastructure and Natural Resources Platforms. Thanks for joining us today, Jeff. Thanks for having me on, John. I'm excited to be with you. Great. So you currently run the infrastructure platform alongside Dylan Fu. And more recently, Strong had also led the asset manager's $1 billion acquisition of a portfolio of equity stakes in conventional, renewable, and midstream energy assets held by GE Capital's EFS Group. Those assets would form the backbone of Apollo's first infrastructure fund. Today, we will talk to Jeff about Apollo's efforts on its infrastructure platform today and also his views on renewables, particularly as it remains a hub of M&A activity. So, Jeff, let's start by talking about your role within Apollo Infrastructure and working alongside Dylan Fu and what the strategy is going to be at a higher level in terms of both sectors and geographies Apollo will be focusing on. Yeah, happy to do that. So I joined Apollo a little over eight years ago. So it's been the better part of a decade now and I've been focusing on infrastructure and infrastructure-related investing through that time. My co-head of infrastructure, Dylan Fu, joined the firm last year from A&P Capital. And Dylan brings a really fantastic track record and a very complimentary background to that of my own to help me lead and grow the business from here. So his background has been more around communications and transportation and some of these other sectors that touch infrastructure, whereas my background has been more on power, renewables, LNG, water, some of the things that touch more of the energy value chain. So together we've really kind of touched most of the broader infrastructure sector. So, you know, at Apollo what we've done historically is actually we've been quite active within infrastructure. So we've deployed about $20 billion into infrastructure-related investments. We've talked about the firm's history. About $9 billion of that has been related to equity investments, which is the strategy that Dylan and I specifically oversee. So at a high level, while we do have a global mandate, we tend to focus primarily in the infrastructure side, North America and Western Europe and some of those markets. And then the key focus sectors are renewables, communications, transportation, and maybe to some extent midstream and some of the ancillary areas around that as well. The last thing I would say is a big part of what we've done historically has been not just renewables, but just ESG and sustainability broadly. That's a really important part of our platform at Apollo, not just in infrastructure but across the firm. I think infrastructure is an area where we really, you know, place particular emphasis on that, and that's something that our LPs are increasingly focused on as well. But we've got, I think, a very extensive and strong track record in renewables and that area that really is benefiting from the broader energy transition that we're seeing today. Great. Thank you for that. And I think you may have answered a question I was going to ask later about ESG policy at Apollo. So mission accomplished. So the infrastructure and energy investing worlds have converged in both solar and wind, biomass and some others, alternative energy sources maybe a little bit less. But the key here is competition seems to be around the corner for both opportunities that present development risk as well as mature renewable sources, depending on what level of investor you are. What do you believe is really going to be the innovation going forward in renewable investing going forward? Yeah. So I think it's really important to take kind of a big step back when talking about the mix of energy sources in this country and where we think renewables are going. Even in the last decade, we've seen an enormous increase in the penetration of renewables into the broader energy value chain. So whether that's power generation or storage or other aspects that are more sustainability-driven, demand response in some certain power markets, there's been a big push for this that's been driven at some level by policy, but increasingly just by economics of renewable energy have gotten stronger and stronger, less reliant on government subsidies. We've seen this really start to grow and take off. I think you're going to see some significant increases in areas like storage and some of the ancillary parts that are just going to be necessary. So if you think about wind and solar not running all the time, you're going to need something to provide power to offset that intermittency. And I think that's going to be a growing need here as we move forward. The other big, I think, component of the change that we're seeing is going to be driven by an increased focus on climate change. And so as governments and individuals in the private sector start to think more and more about climate change and adopt policies that are climate-driven, I think you'll see a lot of innovation around that. So, for example, not just changing the types of power generation or encouraging electric vehicles or things like that, but thinking very clearly about transmission lines. California has been very focused on this recently with what they've come to conclude are wildfires that have been caused by climate change. So looking for ways to harden the grid. This is going to require significant infrastructure investing to make that all happen. And I think there's going to be a lot of innovation around that. The last thing I would say is the other kind of innovation that we think about a lot at Apollo is sort of financial innovation or capital structure innovation. And I think one of the core pillars of our strategy around infrastructure has been what we call structured solutions. So making investments in projects and something other than just the common equity and looking for ways to further protect our downside and make the overall economic proposition for the project more attractive. So we're continuing to look for ways to innovate there where we can add our expertise around structuring deals and being a financial partner to investments to create real value for our investors and also our partners in these deals. Great. And alongside those lines, the announcement yesterday from Governor Cuomo about doing electrical vehicle charging stations and making a $750 million commitment, I suppose, goes along those lines as well. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we've definitely seen a big increase in the penetration for electric vehicles. You may have seen Apollo recently announced a transaction involving a company called Fisker, which is an electric vehicle company. There's clearly some trends headed in that direction, but it's going to require some investment in infrastructure. Again, you're going to need more power to power all of these electric vehicles because instead of consuming gasoline, they'll consume power. So it's going to require more power. It's going to require more transmission, and it's going to require that kind of charging infrastructure that was announced by Governor Cuomo. Can you talk about the Fisker investment? It would be good to hear what these guys do and what their role is going to be here. Think about it. At a high level, there are some public filings out there because it is a public company situation. I'll probably be somewhat limited in what I can and cannot say, but effectively we announced a merger with Fisker, Inc. via the SPAC that Apollo manages, a company called Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. So it's a combination that will effectively, as of closing, make Fisker a publicly traded company alongside companies, obviously Tesla being by far the leader in this space, but other companies that are in the public market now looking to capture these trends, whether it's Nikola or Hyliion or some of these others, Fisker would be another player in that space. And it's a company that we think is really well situated to take a meaningful chunk of that market share. Great. So going back to solar and wind, we talk a lot, as much as we talk about M&A, I think there's always the backdrop of policy as well as the success or failure in the U.S. seems to hinge on things like federal tax credits and the ability to bring in tax equity to fund these projects on both sides of the fence, if you will. Do you believe that the structure has to change at some point to make it even more efficient for wind and solar production across the country, given how some of these folks that are in the production of solar and wind seem to just be reliant on tax credits being renewed and a healthy tax equity industry, if you will? Great question. So historically, I think that has absolutely been the case. And what we've seen recently, though, has been a lot of innovation making wind turbines more efficient, making solar panels more efficient, and getting closer and closer to reaching grid parity with traditional or fossil sources of power generation. So our view is that over time, a lot of this renewable energy development will become less dependent on subsidies from the federal level. That being said, the subsidies are there, and there are a lot of projects, depending on the individual characteristics of that project, that do require that or rely on it. But again, the trends of making these projects more efficient, costs coming down, they are achieving what's called grid parity with many other sources of power generation. Take Europe, for example, where we've seen offshore wind as an example effectively reach grid parity and not be reliant on any sort of subsidies. So we think that's the trend that's happening. That being said, that's not the case across the board. And so we still see the federal incentives, whether it's through the tax equity and tax credit structures that we talked about, or at the state level, where a lot of states are providing PPAs or ORECs to incentivize the development of renewable energy assets. They will play an important role during this transition period. So to your question, it's much better for the developers and the investors in these projects to have clarity on what those structures and incentives look like. And the worst thing for a project, especially a long-dated project, is to have uncertainty around really any of the components of where the money's coming from, because it just sort of slows everything else down. So I do think getting a little bit more clarity on where those programs stand, whether it's increasing them or terminating them altogether, that'll allow the industry, the developers, the investors to operate with a clear set of facts and allow them to make the assumptions on what the deal looks like. But the worst thing for a capital investment, especially for long-dated fixed infrastructure assets like this, is uncertainty. So whatever that certainty may be, I think it would be much better to have a little bit more stability and visibility into what that program looks like. Great. There seems to be a very robust demand for renewable projects in La Dan, Chile comes to mind, among some other geographies. Does that present an interesting opportunity for you guys, or do you believe there's just too much sovereign risk associated with projects such as these? I think it's a really good question, and it's a complicated question. So whenever we look at new investments, really across the platform, we have to take into account all of those risk factors because our most important job is protecting the capital that's been entrusted to us by the pensioners and others who invest in our funds. And so we take that obligation very, very seriously. So we do look at sovereign risk. We look at currency risk. We look at the risk of some rules or laws or something changing in given markets. And it's very important to us that there's a very clear pattern of predictable rule of law, the validity of contracts and all of that in the investments that we make. But we do have a global mandate. We have funds across the firm that can target different areas and focus on different types of markets. I would say for a traditional infrastructure fund, which is looking for low risk, very predictable cash flow streams, lower volatility in the investments that it makes, and inflation protection, which is an important component when you think about currency issues that may be overlaying a project. For some of those kind of lower risk funds, it may be a little harder to invest in certain emerging markets or markets that have less stable currencies. So we look at everything. We have a global mandate. But those are definitely issues that we have to take into account whenever we look at an investment. Great. Let's go back to energy storage for a sec here. We've seemingly covered a lot in our stories as of late, more the sense of battery storage developers not really getting there on operational assets yet but putting assets under development and looking for clear equity partners to come in and help defray the costs associated with development of these projects. Other folks we talked to say that the storage industry still needs a lot of work to get to, notwithstanding the demand, which we all understand here, but that it still needs a lot of work in getting into the phase where it's investable. Definitely wanted to just get your view on this on where you think we are and where you think we need to go to get the energy storage space to a more mature level. This is one of the most important topics out there for sure in renewable energy. We have spent a lot of time and had a lot of exposure to battery storage and energy storage projects around the U.S. and have been involved with one of the largest battery storage projects in the world. This is something we've spent a lot of time thinking about. Just to reset the topic, there are hours in the day when the sun is not shining. There's times when the wind is blowing very strong and there's times when it's not blowing at all. We call this in renewable energy the intermittency of renewables. Unlike a coal plant, which can just burn at the same level continuously 24-7, or a natural gas plant, a combined cycle gas plant can do the same thing. That's not true of wind and solar. You have to find a way to offset that, either by storing that excess energy that's created during the peak sun hours or the peak wind hours, storing it and using it later. The way to do that is with batteries. There's a few other techniques as well, but that's really the main focus. We've spent a lot of time looking at that issue, and you're absolutely right that on its own, the investments in some of these energy storage opportunities are not obviously compelling. It really depends on the site-specific, idiosyncratic issues that are going on with each location. In some locations and in some hubs, you're going to find that the energy storage is a much more compelling economic proposition. In others, that's not going to be the case. This is going to be an issue that gets solved by the industry. It's going to get solved by batteries becoming more and more efficient. And yes, it's going to get solved by subsidies to some extent during a period of time. But if you want to have a really steep, quick ramp in renewable energy and have it displace more and more fossil-based generation, we're going to have to solve this issue. We've seen some states take a pretty aggressive view on this, California, for example, providing a lot of subsidies around battery storage. And so you're going to need to see some more and more of this to really kind of accelerate that. But it is very, very clear, and we've talked to a lot of experts in battery technology, this technology is emerging very, very quickly, and we do expect over time it to get more and more economic and for these projects to begin to stand on their own. But for the time being, we're not quite there, and a lot of these projects, to make economic sense, do require some level of subsidy. Just to expand on that a little bit, were there any promising federal programs out there that you've observed that is going to become more visible that applies to this? So far what we've seen has been more at the state level, and I should have mentioned before, too, this isn't just happening with government subsidies. I mean, we are seeing a lot of big, major public companies do things to subsidize this for their own purposes. So very, very large companies are out there signing PPAs, signing deals to support storage projects, in part because those companies have decided it's the right thing to do, they've decided it makes economic sense if they're large consumers of energy and electricity. And then the other big push in this direction is coming from a lot of shareholders. So we've seen BlackRock and others make big announcements around trying to get companies to divest fossil generation or reduce their carbon footprint or improve their sustainability profile. This is a very real trend and a very real development. It's being led by large institutional shareholders, pension funds who hold very, very large stakes in public companies around the world. So their shareholders are kind of pushing them in this direction. And they can, in some ways, provide a little bit of a role that government does not. But to answer your question specifically, what we've seen has been a little bit more at the state level than at the federal level. Now, we're all kind of quickly digesting some of the announcements that were made by presidential candidate Joe Biden and what his administration might try and do. We do have an election coming up very soon, and we suspect that those two administrations would treat these issues very, very differently. So I think stay tuned to see how that election, what happens. And then I think a Department of Energy under a President Biden probably looks quite a bit different from a Department of Energy under President Trump. So that'll be, I think, an important development that we'll know, we'll have more clarity on in the next few months. Great. And to conclude, obviously, in today's times that we're living in, just going back to your natural resources background, just a lot of conventional drillers have obviously filed for bankruptcy as oil prices remain at a very low price and obviously uneconomical to drill in the U.S. If you could just quickly, you know, at a higher level, give your view on sort of the outlook for the industry and, you know, what changes do you think need to take place here? I know it's not a short answer, but if you could just give us your best shot at this, I'd appreciate it. Absolutely. And as you mentioned, I'm the Co-Head of Infrastructure and Natural Resources at Apollo. We do run those as two very separate businesses with, you know, very different, you know, risk return objectives, infrastructure business being, you know, a much more, you know, sort of a lower risk investment strategy that's focused on, you know, contracted cash flows, contracted renewable power generation and things like that. But the natural resources business historically has had exposure, you know, up and down the energy value chain, including some exposure with oil and gas and traditional energy. So we have seen some of this and we follow this very closely. I think we've got several internal proprietary macro studies that we've done around all of this and I think have a pretty strong view of both kind of the short, medium term and the longer term outlook for the sector. Taking a step back, what we've seen over the last decade has been very profound in this country and I'm not sure it really gets enough attention, but the U.S. has gone from producing, you know, five or six million barrels a day to, you know, up to a peak of over 13 million barrels a day of oil, which for a period of time made it the largest oil producer in the world. This had, you know, profound economic implications and geopolitical implications for a lot of reasons that are probably intuitive for folks who follow the industry. And then this has obviously knock-on effects of making, you know, byproducts a lot cheaper to develop, whether that's chemicals or other industrial outputs. It's created a lot of jobs, not just with the drillers, but the midstream companies, the companies who provide services to each of these businesses, all the way down to the end user who has benefited from, you know, extremely low gasoline prices over the last few years. All of that's been because the U.S. has increased production. The rest of the world has not. So this excess supply that's brought price down has been largely a U.S.-driven phenomenon. So it's had a very significant impact. That lower price, though, has created clearly some pressure on these companies, some of whom have put a lot of debt onto their businesses, and that's led to the bankruptcies that you're talking about. I think over time, what we expect to happen is for the U.S. production levels to decline somewhat, and it's already happening as the number of rigs running in the U.S. has really fallen off very significantly this year. It's even down a little bit last year. So that's going to, we think, lead to more of an equilibrium where the U.S. is probably producing a little bit less, maybe something like 10 million barrels a day or lower, but still a significant amount of oil and is still a top-three oil producer globally. But it gets to more of an equilibrium point where the U.S. and then the OPEC-producing countries kind of act as that swing producer where you produce a little bit more when there's a shortage and a little bit less when there seems to be a surplus. The U.S. obviously can't act as a cartel and these things are all driven by individual decisions by thousands of companies, but it is a very economic decision. If the price is too low, people are just going to drill less. So that's how we expect that to play out over time. That will have a pretty significant knock-on effect through the rest of the value chain. It will impact, you know, not just the companies that drill for the oil or the companies who own the rigs and provide the services or provide the frack crews, but it's also going to impact the midstream companies who rely on volumes flowing through their pipelines. It's going to impact the refineries who make, you know, the gasoline. It'll have impacts for, you know, the availability of energy just broadly defined to the manufacturing sector to the U.S. So, you know, that'll be something that we see play out over the next 12 to 24 months. In the very, very near term, obviously demand has been depressed significantly from COVID-19, which led to lockdown orders across the country and around the world. While that was happening, people weren't driving and road transportation accounts for about 45% of global demand for oil. So when no one's driving, no one's flying airplanes, you know, the demand really cratered and that's what led to the price collapse. As we've seen the economy start to reopen, people driving again, we do expect that to normalize and get closer to that equilibrium level that we talked about. Our view is we should continue to expect to see a lot of volatility around this driven both by the demand side. If there's an increasing wave of coronavirus cases that lead to more lockdown orders, you'll see demand fall again. That'll create increases in storage levels that'll drive price down. But this, you know, we would expect there to be, you know, a bumpy ride until we're back to a more normalized demand outlook. But over the longer term, we do think the U.S. will continue to play an important role in production of oil and gas on a global basis. Great. Well, I wanted to thank again, Jeff, for coming on the show today. Really appreciate it. And that's about all the time we have. Burke out.

I'm Jonathan Burke, America's Editor for Information. Joining me today is Robin Ganguly, the Asian Editor for Information, live from Hong Kong. Thanks for joining us today, sir. Appreciate it. And Jonathan Carmody, the Latin American Editor. Today, we're going to discuss Asian cross-border investment. Later in the program, we will talk to Michael Lukosky to discuss state funding needs for U.S. infrastructure projects. But first, let's talk about Asian investment. If you look at information deals, you can see that Japanese trading houses such as Marabini, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi have anywhere between 20% to 40% of their portfolio housed in Latin American infrastructure assets. While the Chinese have been extremely active in Brazil, with the likes of China Communications Construction Co., we know it is CCCC showing interest in a Brazilian port project. So against this backdrop, Robin, perhaps, and again, thank you for making your Crossroads debut here. Perhaps you can talk to us about how there's been such a huge intersection of Asian capital with Latin American projects in terms of how it's been active historically. And do you foresee a continuance of this? Thanks, Sean. Yes, definitely. I mean, looking at what COVID-19 has done over the past few months, sure, there's a dampener on how things are happening. But if you look historically, I think your question is a bit more, you know, perspective. So looking at it from a historical perspective over the past 20 years, 25 years or so, we've seen China investing a lot of money in Latin America and one of the things that have helped Chinese, mainly state-run companies, I might add, get into Latin America were friendly governments, slightly left-leaning governments that you had in Latin America. So I think that has really helped. Things have changed somewhat over the last several years, over the last decade or so. And but, you know, Chinese investments have kept on growing. If you look, you know, from 2005 to say around 2019, so you've had more than 140, 150 billion US dollars invested in Latin America from the Chinese side. And mainly, historically, we've seen like, you know, the bigger Chinese players such as, you know, China Three Gorges, we have the State Grid Corporation of China, then we have China Southern Power Grid, then China State Power and, you know, even China Investment Corp. So it has seen a lot of interest. But however, if something that's very interesting over the past maybe three, four years or so, we're seeing more Chinese commercial lenders, commercial companies like, you know, who are less driven by policy. I mean, the overhang of policy requirements and friendly governments is still there, of course, definitely. But the Chinese lenders are slightly changing. You know, they are also very interested in commercial returns. Now, the second part of your question, whether this is going to continue. Yes, it definitely will. But I think they may have to wait a while. Traditionally, if you look at China and most other countries in the world, you know, China still is, I think. Jonathan would be able to correct me on this, is the second largest trade partner for Latin America. I think, you know, we've seen recently, you know, China Three Gorges expressing interest. I mean, saying that it would probably bid for some projects that are coming up as well after the whole pandemic thing, you know, eases off. But the Chinese, they do like to go in person. So when international flights open up, you know, they will do that. However, you know, we must note also that any time in the past decade or so that China has faced a slowing economy, it has looked inwards rather than outwards. So there are two facets to this. Chinese companies will, over the next few months, increase their focus on domestic markets. That said, I'm not sure that they will, you know, stop investing completely in Latin America or anywhere else. Latin America, I think, you know, will offer them a lot of opportunity as far as bargains are concerned. I mean, the people that I spoke with over the last couple of months, they are, you know, all looking forward to bargains around the world, especially in Latin America and Asia. Yeah, I think it's a very decent summary, Robin. I think one of the other interesting things is to note how these companies are entering Latin America. For a long time, speaking to my sources in the region, we'd heard that Chinese companies were very keen in particular. Japanese companies have been there for longer. But Chinese companies have been very keen to get into the sector, although they weren't particularly good at bidding for assets in the past. In the Greenfields tenders, we often saw that Chinese companies would express interest, they would bid, but they wouldn't win a lot. A good example of that was the 4G highway program in Colombia. It was around a $20 billion program of about 27 projects, all highways in the country, very sizable highways. We're talking between $300 and maybe $800 million in CapEx requirements. Chinese didn't win any of those projects in the tenders. And I think when you look at the database and information, what you see is that afterwards, post facto, we've seen a lot of the companies coming in and now are trying to buy the concessions, trying to say, look, we were interested in this deal. We did want it at the time. Now that the construction is almost complete, now that the asset is almost operational, the Chinese still want those assets. They still want a presence in Latin America. I was talking to a sector banker here in New York the other day. And he said to me that a lot of these players, you mentioned China's state grid, mentioned China Three Gorges. A lot of these players really see themselves as underexposed to Latin America. And they're very keen to improve that situation and gain more exposure to the sector. So it's very interesting to see the activity. You know, the exceptions to that and the proof that the Chinese investment in Latin America is evolving have to be the rail projects in Colombia. We saw some very competitive auctions for the largest infrastructure project in Colombia, which is the Metro de Bogotá. This is the first metro line that they want to build in the city of Bogotá. Having been to Bogotá, I can tell you it's absolutely essential because the traffic is a nightmare. But the bidding was very competitive. There were very interesting teams, people from Europe like FCC, people for like Carso and Ideal from Mexico, very, very big players. And the winner of the bid, despite the intense competition, was actually China Harbor Engineering and the Xi'an Metro Company. And, you know, this was very interesting to see a major project which is going to require probably over a billion dollars in financing, finally being won by a Chinese company. And now we get to see how the Chinese go about financing the project as well. The other project I'm thinking about in Colombia is very much the Rejio Tram project. Rejio Tram being an LRT north of the city of Bogotá. And again, a Greenfield project that they won the bidding for. And we're very interested to see how that develops and how they fund these projects now that they've won the contracts. Hey, Jonathan, just if I may address, I think very, very interesting points, especially about the fact that, you know, they were bidding but not kind of making it to the ticketing. But I think that may also, you know, as you said, so things are changing at the moment. One of the major reasons for that is, you know, between 2017, 2018 and like early 2019, the big Chinese banks and the big Chinese investors were all trying to do their, you know, their advisory services were mainly in-house. But now what they've started doing, and there's growing evidence of this, is they've started realizing the value of taking on external advisors, especially when preparing bids in geographies that they're not that familiar with. Because this, I think, is a major reason why you may see more competitive bidding from Chinese and even possibly Japanese companies. Yeah, absolutely. And that's a very good point. I think that is, again, what we've seen is how they've learned that that's what they needed. They needed that local advice and they needed local firms to be able to tell them how to win these projects, how they were bidding wrong previously. You know, it's very interesting as well. You know, we look at some of the largest deals in the quarter. We're about to publish a second quarter league table report. And two of the largest deals are by Chinese companies. China Three Gorges bought the Luz del Sur distribution company from Sempra in Peru for around $4 billion. And State Grid Corporation of China bought Sempra's other asset in the distribution sector in Chile, Chilquinta, for around $2.23 billion. So major, major transactions. Both transactions where there were other European bidders and US bidders who were very vocal about wanting to win these assets, very vocal about wanting to add them to their portfolios. In particular, I'm thinking of Italy's Enel that came out and said it was very keen to acquire both of these businesses. And yet we saw Chinese buyers win the auction in both cases. A lot of people, perhaps it's simplistic to say that, but when I was talking to other bidders and other advisors who are working on those deals, one of the things they said is that the benefits that Chinese companies have in particular is access to cheap money. It's very easy for them to finance these acquisitions through state-backed banks and state-backed programs. It seems like it's a very coherent strategy on behalf of the Chinese companies. We know that a lot of the companies are state-backed and that provides them with incredible financial muscle to be able to compete aggressively for these kinds of assets. The cost of capital is always going to win the day. Robin, just going back to a quick point you made earlier about Japanese commercial lenders and how that dynamic was changing. Were you just referring to their appetite to just do more direct investing overseas? I was actually referring to the Chinese, but the Japanese, I mean, I was just in Tokyo last year, so I don't see a huge change, a huge appetite for risk. The Japanese have traditionally been safer bets, lower returns. They're happy with returns of 3% where Chinese, they may want more than 10% to 11%. That's the gap that you might get between the two. And remember, Chinese money does come with its own pitfalls, right? Doesn't it? It's quite expensive. But yeah, but in China, definitely, money isn't free by any standards. So earlier, 10 years ago, I mean, you would have a lot of consideration for state policy, for geopolitics, et cetera, which is still definitely there. I mean, with the US-China trade war coming up, as in intensifying, so to speak, you just find the deal in January. But yes, I think commercial interests will slowly start taking over. But overall, if you remember in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that in 10 years or so, you're not going to have the intent to have $250 billion of Chinese investments in Latin America. So I think that's going to carry on for a while. Great. So just shifting over to the US-Asian trade dynamic, you had co-authored a story in December about the US trade deal. And obviously, things have changed massively since then. But can you just kind of update us where that is now at this point? In the sign of the times, I mean, the fact that you mentioned this, and I had no recollection about the story that I wrote, just shows how much things have changed in the six months we're living in a different world entirely. So, I mean, you know, in December, and then, you know, just kind of sealed, signed, sealed and delivered in January. So we were expecting, hoping that things are going to quiet down. We always knew that it was never going to go away completely. But with a lot of, forgive the expression, but a lot of bluster coming from both sides, things are not really looking up. And with the whole Hong Kong situation that, you know, that the political situation about China, the security law, so that might drive up deepened tensions between the two sides. And I think overall, there are two ways to look at it. One is that everybody's going to lose, which is a fact. But on the other hand, you know, you do have, you know, China's Belt and Road Initiative, which, you know, would probably, you know, China has been trying and pushing this quite extensively. And, you know, the US, Australia, they're trying to form a sort of counter, counterparty to that. So we could get some interesting competition for investments, which could be, in fact, not that bad for industry. Yeah, I think the other interesting thing is to see the type of assets that the Chinese companies in particular have been acquiring. As you mentioned earlier, Japanese companies tend to go for solid, you know, dependable returns, things like transmission or distribution companies, electric utilities, water utilities, in places like Chile, which are very well regulated and viewed very favorably by institutional investors. And the Chinese really had a strong play for energy assets and power assets. You know, in Brazil, they've acquired numerous wind farms and hydroelectric plants. In Peru, the Chagia facility was one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the country. And that was acquired by the Chinese. And to see them now moving more into the transport space, you know, that's interesting. Historically, there was an incident in 2014, 2015, when the Mexican government actually awarded China, well, a Chinese company, the Carretero high-speed rail train. Now, this was a $3.5 billion project. There was a little bit of a delay in the development of the train, Now, this was a $3.5 billion project. There was a little bit of controversy around the bidding. How had this company won? They were the sole bidder. How could you guarantee value for money in the bidding process? And there was a lot of rumors that the U.S. just was really unhappy that a Chinese company would win a project that size in Mexico. Now, fast forward a few months to mid-2015, and the Chinese government was really upset when Mexico canceled that project very unexpectedly, seemingly without much reason. There was never really a good excuse given. And I think when you look at where China has invested and where Chinese companies have invested after that incident, it's been outside of Mexico. It's been south of Mexico, places like Brazil, places like Colombia, which have good relationships with the U.S., but are not perhaps regarded so much as the U.S.'s backyard. So it's interesting to see that dynamic when you talk about the trade deals. Obviously, let's not forget that the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, now known as the USMCA, was also signed again earlier this year, passing through Congress. And AMLO, President of Mexico, was here buddying up with Donald Trump, despite all of the things that have happened between Mexico and the U.S. in the last few years. So there's strategic plays around the relationships. And just one final indication of that to give you would be Paraguay, one of the few countries in Latin America that still recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state. And as a result, doesn't really have much relationship with China, doesn't really have the business relationships with China that the other countries do, and stands as a real outlier, whereas everybody else is very keen to tap into Chinese markets, especially for their raw materials and their minerals that they can export. Charleston, if I may, I have a very quick question for you. I was speaking to a very senior AIIB official a couple of weeks ago. I'm very curious to see, I mean, you know, I know that they do have some pending Latin American memberships. How do investors in Latin America view the AIIB? That's not a question I've asked them a lot, but I will definitely add it to my list of questions. I really don't know. I mean, do they see it as an arm of the state, or is it? I would say that I've never heard it mentioned in Latin American project finance. Were you thinking in regards to financing projects? Yes. So again, what we've seen traditionally in Chinese investment in Latin America has been predominantly M&A. There hasn't been a lot of financing involved in that. A lot of these bids are done without any kind of acquisition financing. But now that we're seeing companies like Costco shipping, acquiring a major port project to be built in Peru, now that we have the Metro deal that I talked about in Colombia, we may see more interest in acquiring fronts from the AIIB. And so I think that's something that may come into focus in the next few months, whereas it hasn't previously been because most of the investment has been straight equity acquisitions. Okay. Okay, great stuff. Just circling back one final question to you, Robin. Just talking about opportunity and opportunity for Chinese. Yesterday it was announced that Partners Group had acquired something called the C-BRAS Group, which is a subsea fiber optic cable system network between Brazil and USA. Partners was an original backer of that project as the lender, and they took over the keys in a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S. Circling back to the Chinese and opportunity, given everything that's happened in the past four months, there could very well be a lot of opportunity coming down the path for the Chinese and anyone else looking into various parts of both corporate and real assets in the U.S. Have you heard from anything in the investment community about the opportunity here? There hasn't been much in the way of Chinese involvement in infrastructure over here other than through, sorry, Asian even, sorry, through rail projects where they obviously have a technology expertise and they're an investor in the high-speed rail project right now from Dallas to Houston, which is still in early stages. But other than that, not a massive infusion of capital that we're seeing in Latin America. But long way of asking, have you heard anything new in terms of opportunities for the Chinese in the U.S. market? If you're talking about the United States of America itself, yes, I have heard quite a fair bit from the senior financing people that I've spoken to. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to one of them who is the overseas representative of a major Chinese bank, and she was quite emphatic in the sense that it's not really worth their while trying to invest a lot of money in the U.S. given the current political tension. So quite a few people said, it's not really worth their time and their trouble and the risk that something might happen as far as U.S.-China political tensions are concerned. And I think the Chinese are more interested in Latin America, as you know, and Africa, they've got a lot to do in the rest of Asia as well, that a lot of opportunities are opening up. I think some of these companies, mainland Chinese companies and banks and lenders are a little bit straining at the leash. So they are looking for a lot of bargains. So I suspect that when flights, et cetera, open up, there will be a spike in Chinese investments, but I don't really see that happen either in the U.S. or in most of Europe as well. I'm not sure that that answers your question, but in the U.S. I'm not seeing a lot of Chinese investments coming in in the near future. Yeah, thank you for having those as a good answer and appreciate the commentary. Raised an interesting point though about Africa. Jonathan's readers are watching an auction right now that goes to both Latin America as well as Africa. And I'm talking about mainstream renewables, which has a 10 gigawatt portfolio of renewable projects either being constructed or in development. And part portfolio is in Chile. There's some assets in Africa. And I think they have a few in Europe. First round bids were due there in late June, June 26th. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens there and who winds up as the bidders. I mean, I keep hearing more piecemeal given how diverse some of those assets are geographically. So curious to see if there's any Asian bid in on that front. In any case, Robin, thank you for joining us today. Really appreciate it. Come back anytime. Jonathan, good to have you as always. Thanks, Amy. We'll move on to the next segment. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Will. Okay, so we move on to speak with Michael Lukosky, who's a partner in Advantage Infrastructure and advisor to governors, multinationals, investment groups, and the like on Project Finance. So, Michael, thanks for joining the program. And also, sorry, joining us is Andrew Vitelli, who's one of our reporters and information group as well. So, Michael, last time we spoke on the phone, you said you were currently looking at municipalities, municipal agencies, and how they get projects funded, specifically WIFIA and TIFIA, but then other funding mechanisms outside of WIFIA and TIFIA. So why don't you start, well, explain exactly what some of these programs are and what some recent developments have been since we last chatted? Yeah, and thank you. Thanks for the opportunity to speak to folks. Yeah, since the infrastructure, federal infrastructure landscape is changing pretty dramatically right now. New programs are being introduced at the White House level as well as within Congress, both parties. I think the most important shift going on right now is that while we all in the industry recognize that infrastructure is not mainly federal and moreover, we will not and probably should not aim to have there be a federalization of infrastructure projects. When that's happened in the past, it's been largely unsuccessful. That said, what we're seeing, going to continue to see, is a additional range of federal programs available for infrastructure. Perhaps the most important, particularly for the funds, is vehicles and enhancements to vehicles which are going to be available to private equity funds across the board, to large corporates, including infrastructure across the board. We can go into some of these, but the main thrust is that that we're seeing a lot of and we'll see a lot of infrastructure legislation. It just may not be called infrastructure. So we'll see in our seeing programs along those lines. With regard to the TIFIA, WIFIA and the basic alphabet soup of programs, either in the DOT, EPA and elsewhere, increasingly what we're seeing and what we're going to see is we're going to see, rather than siloed off programs within one sector or another sector, we're going to see decisions around infrastructure driven by things such as the site location and the expansion of advanced manufacturing facilities and the like that need large amounts of infrastructure, water intensive, energy intensive, a need for logistics infrastructure, a communications infrastructure, etc. And even with our various sector specific programs, nobody's really going to realistically who want those plants with infrastructure built to suit, wait in line for TIFIA program, wait in line for Infogrants, wait in line for WIFIA, etc. There's going to be more and more one-stop shops for bringing together different federal, state and local incentive programs. Interesting. So what can you maybe illustrate what some of these funding programs are or some recent examples to cite? So regardless of what we do with infrastructure programs, particularly incentives for public-private partnerships, eBay, P3s or other vehicles, we really only have five or six ways that we can incentivize these programs. And everything we see, virtually everything we see is some version of these. And in the past, during the last crisis, the 2007-2008 financial crisis, we saw a range of programs. We saw 52 public-private partnership incentive programs of various sorts. When it all boiled down, you can get loan instruments, bond vehicles, bond incentives, so loans, bonds, tax credits, insurance, and then competitive grants. The main thing that's been added since that period is a couple of investment platforms from the JOBS Act and then the Opportunity Zone programs. But that's your universe, six different types of vehicles. And then there's different elements to these vehicles, different target investors for these vehicles, et cetera. But when it boils down to it, it's those, it's that menu of vehicles. And the P3 community thus far, even in the 2007-2008 crisis, has really nibbled at the edges of these available vehicles. And what we're seeing from a client perspective is those ones that are becoming and on their way to becoming most successful are asset managers or third-party fund vehicles, which have a great deal of flexibility built into them with regard to the duration that they can hold an asset before shedding it or the like, including sectoral-based, not single and siloed, sectoral-based approaches. These are, these embarge multinational corporates that do investment off balance sheet or otherwise. Those are the types of financing groups that are going to be really going to outpace others, especially ones that are able to do innovative things with debt, either on a standalone basis, funds with a debt component or corporates with a debt component, or are able to partner with, what I would say, smart debt providers. And there's always been a resistance within the industry for a number of different compelling reasons to not leverage innovative debt vehicles, but instead to see debt as something that was simply part of a mix, a passive type of participation that made some of the P3 projects get going. We're no longer in the, since Dodd-Frank, no longer in the business of being successful by viewing our debt partners as purely passive participation. That has to change for success to be optimized. Very true words. So just a two-part question as a follow-up. When we talk about smart debt vehicles and debt partners, I'd be curious if you were referring specifically to infrastructure debt funds, which have done quite well in the past year or so in terms of their fundraising abilities, or are you referring to other vehicles within private credit or some mixture of both? And then behind that too, I'd like to kind of get your sense in the municipal debt market. What's your sort of sense for them the rest of the year in terms of being a supporting partner on some of these projects that are in the pipeline? Sure. Great question. So the first one is pretty easy to directly address, which is there's just a growing need for debt funds and for debt vehicles. So what I'm pointing to definitely brings in the debt vehicles. The debt vehicles are just starting to be thought through in terms of what folks are looking for in debt and on the debt front. I'd say that one of the areas that the debt universe is much larger than the debt funds. And some of the greatest dynamism within the P3 sector with regard to debt, we're going to see from other types of debt providers as well. First, as a general matter, if you can play with debt, then there's going to be project finance opportunities that are debt driven vehicles without equity. I think one of the things that we're learning right now is twofold and that transitions into the muni program market, which is that Dodd-Frank and the associated Volcker Rule and associated changes to the infrastructure financing market in 2007, 2008 have touched off a whole range of changes within the muni debt program. I think the muni debt programs have become much more innovative some of the folks that sat within the investment banks on the debt side have moved into other sections of the investment banks and outside of the investment banks. They're not just providing tax exempt and taxable debt. They're providing innovative loan vehicles to municipalities whereby one can take out public agencies or taking out senior loans that are senior to their bond holders without disclosing their seniority to the existing bond holders, perfectly permissible types of activities. So I think that as a general matter, we're going to see and we're seeing the muni market somewhat of an appetite for the public institutions to take out more debt rather than last time where we were so focused on moving to off balance sheet solutions through equity. The latter will always be essential in the core element of the P3 market. But there are coming in the shortly programs that allow public entities to restructure their balance sheets since we're like taking down a second mortgage on their balance sheet. Where they'll be able to unlock a lot of capital from their balance sheet. So that will be almost like an equity like vehicle and those have happened in the past during 2007, 2008. So those will be quite important. So I would say as a general matter, the muni bond market and the muni loan market has been transforming and we had such an issue because of the origins most of the private equity firms outside of Macquarie, outside of IFM and outside of Meridian and a few others. Most of our funds are vintage, are pre early vintage. And so as a result, we have to be open to doing new things. The days of the equity folks doing battle with the debt folks and vice versa has to change. Otherwise, we're not going to see any real active participation by the equity providers to scale unless the two parties just come to terms with each other and stop treating with one another as arch enemies in the market as has traditionally happened. Great, Andrew, you'd written about one of those interesting developments circulating around the Senate yesterday. Why don't you tell us? Yeah, that's right. One of the most recent proposals was a bipartisan legislation proposed by Roger Wicker, who's a Republican from Mississippi and Michael Bennett from Colorado is a Democrat and it would create what are called American infrastructure bonds. And I guess these would build on the Build America bonds and they're supposed to be increase the flexibility that's associated with them. Curious whether you've taken a look at this proposal, whether you think that is kind of a need, whether the Build America bonds program can be built upon in that way? Yeah, it's a very good question. So we've been working on these issues for a number of months on that type of vehicle. And then also last time around, the 2007-2008, where we saw the Build America bonds or the BABs come in, I advised extensively the Treasury Department on that program. First of all, we have to boil it down a little bit. We're not going to see Build America bonds or BABs again for a number of reasons. However, what we will see and what this piece of legislation, amongst other similar pieces of legislation do, is they provide a subsidy to help draw institutional investors, pensions, sovereigns, insurance funds and others into the marketplace. By taking the tax-exempt bond subsidy that comes from the Federal Treasury Department by way of foregoing tax revenue from the municipal bondholders, so the Treasury sees that as a hit to the market, and replacing it with a grant, with a subsidy for these large institutional investors to come in who have been not able to participate in the tax-exempt market. One of the successes of the Build America bond program, which will be in this iteration, will be the fact that the public entities are going to have the option, most likely, of taking that subsidy that would usually be a foregone revenue to the U.S. Treasury Department, letting the public entities have that cash. And that will create an incentive to use the program. However, for the P3 community, we have to take care, we have to be more flexible because this bond vehicle, which isn't just debt, it also involves unlocking of a subsidy to the public entities for taking out this debt for a range of public purposes. Well, this will be a competitor to the private fund model. This is, if all we are doing at the P3 sector in the fund model, be it debt or equity, is to bundle the sovereigns, the pensions, insurance funds, and others, and then to drive their money through our P3 vehicles into the market. Well, the new Build America bond program will be aiming to drive that same class of investors into the market. And the truth is, they've had a lot more success historically through these Build America bond type programs than we have as an industry with regard to our own vehicles. So last time around, the Build America bond program, which was bipartisan in usage, over six quarters, really five, only five active quarters, it raised about $168 billion of money that went into the market. Gosh, that's a whole lot more than what we're raising and deploying in the market, what we're deploying rather in the market by bundling those same outside investors. So somebody's doing this right. And I would say that they're doing it right in certain ways because they're accommodating the existing tax exempt and taxable market rather than saying, oh, well, we do it better, do it our way. And the latter approach has not been as successful as anybody around would like it to be. We can't go to one of the core lessons is that we have so much post-Dodd-Frank available, so much more flexibility in our global asset managers and our fund structures. We have to look at these types of programs, these tax credit programs, Andrew, that you're raising. And we have to think as an industry, how do we learn, but how do we now compete these groups? Otherwise, we're going to see our sovereigns, all of our LPs start to migrate towards these other vehicles, which are largely being carried out by our peers in the debt investment banker side and elsewhere. Yeah, it kind of makes me think on two levels. Do you have a great playing field if you're a grant or this kind of thing, if say these bonds ever came to light with that against the private market, you know, sweet options is never a bad thing. But to your point at the same end of things, the role of the equity investor in these projects starts to be deminimized somewhat. Is that kind of what you're thinking there, Mike? Yeah, it is. I think we have a few challenges on the equity side and on the debt fund side, but we see purely on the equity fund side is the new accounting rules is throwing a lot of the availability payment off balance sheet solution onto the balance sheet of issuers of public entities that we have to deal with. We have to adapt with the products that we offer as a result of that trend. And that trend is also happening meanwhile with this other trend, which is incentives to take out more debt for public entities. And if you look at the debt market for public entities, the cost of capital is pretty low right now. Balance sheets where folks are willing to take out more debt for some reason and because of really innovations that have been driven by Dodd-Frank, which makes it a different type of debt. And then we're seeing these new programs and we saw a dozen of them at least under the previous 2007, 2008, that if you bring in debt at low interest rate with deep federal subsidies and you restructure your balance sheet, well, you're essentially unlocking capital that you never had as well. So as a result, we have to be, we have to double down, not double down, we have to be much more focused on what is the essence? What is our value proposition from an equity perspective? And then as peers in that market, we have to look around. Some of us are being, are far more successful than others. The trends are to larger long-term dated funds, flexible funds according to sector. Asset managers are becoming more and more successful relative to other peers. Closed-ended funds are great for deploying capital, but increasingly the assets on offer are calling for longer dated equity vehicles. A range of things like that that we're seeing in the market that need to be a time for self-reflection so we can optimize our vehicles which are incredibly sophisticated and incredibly diverse. Not all funds or investment vehicles are created the same. So if we see certain peers continue to get shortlisted on most of the projects, or we see new entrants from different parts of the world start to play and play successfully, well, let's, as the markets begin to figure that out, why are certain vehicles more successful than others and how are they working these things? Because I know nobody wants to not be shortlisted on a recurring basis and nobody wants to be shortlisted only periodically. And those are the types of things that the market has to self-reflect upon before even thinking about what federal subsidies are or can be useful. You have to get through the gate into the shortlist before you worry about the federal subsidies and other subsidies on their way to help you get in that type of position. Well, I think on that note, I think it's about all the time we got. So Michael, thank you for coming on the program today. Really appreciate it. And please tune in next time. Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone.

Joining the program today is John Smolin of counsel with Ballard Sparr, who has carved out a 13-year career in infrastructure law. Today, we delve into the federal infrastructure matters as June has been a very busy month. We've seen the House introduce a new infrastructure bill, and rumors have circulated in the last few days of a new $1 trillion infrastructure bill at the White House. But before we go into those matters, John, I believe a new GASB guidance was issued earlier this week, and there could be some impacts on future P3 projects. Why don't we start off with a little layman's explanation of what these new guidance is, and then sort of talk about how it might impact future P3 projects. Thanks for joining the program today, John. Yeah, thanks for reaching out, John. I'm happy to be on. So, nothing like starting off the morning with a discussion about accounting. And in fair disclosure, I'm not an accountant, I'm a lawyer, but I have to pay attention to sometimes what the accountants say when it comes to how it is that these structures for infrastructure deals, and in particular public-private partnership structure deals, are going to play out. And so, without presuming little, because I actually had to continue to school myself on this, that GASB is an accounting standards board, unlike the engineer world that will come out with standards about how to build a bridge, or how deep concrete should be, or how far apart wheels on a train are supposed to be. They come up with guidance about how public sector entities should be reporting their finances. And they come out with these statements from time to time that have numbers, and the latest statement came out this past Monday. It's their 94th statement, and it pertains to how it is that government entities are supposed to think about availability payment projects. The punchline is that availability payments themselves, which we'll talk about in a minute if you'd like, John, are now being the guidance that public entities are supposed to look at that as debt of the public entity. Before the GASB guidance, that was not clear, and some municipalities and states in particular would take an opinion the other way, that they were contractual obligations, potentially, under arrangements that they would make in these P3 structures, whereas other states would take the more conservative view, which is now the GASB view, that these expected payments over a duration of time are effectively debts of the municipality. So, it's big news in as much as availability payment projects in the P3 structure was a way to tune risk allocation between the public sector and the private sector concessionaires about, in most cases, kind of big deal infrastructure projects that don't necessarily throw off money. So, the easiest example would be to contrast a toll bridge, for example, with, say, a courthouse. In the first case, there is an expectation that people who are using the toll bridge are going to be paying a toll, and that stream of tolls becomes a source of money that could be borrowed against or used or otherwise with respect to the bridge. In a classic project finance, the tolls would go into a pot, the pot would pay for the bridge maintenance or pay for the person that takes your tolls or whatnot, and enterprising bridge builders would say, we project that this many cars will go over this toll bridge over a period of time, and the net present value of all of that money over time today is X, and they go to a bank and borrow X, and then they use that money to build the bridge. Contrast that with a courthouse, for example. In a courthouse, you don't pay money to go into a courthouse, at least you don't pay money to go to the courthouse. You might pay for your lawyers and whatnot, but that's for another day. But the courthouse, it's the same principle. There's this idea that we need a courthouse now, the county doesn't have the money to build it now, but they could either bond for it, ask for it, or they could turn to the private sector under an arrangement that says, we'll enter into a deal where you will essentially come forward and design and build this thing, and furthermore, you're going to be operating it and maintaining it over a period of time, which should influence how it is that you design and build it, because if you're responsible for keeping it up, then so be it. But we're going to measure your payments on the basis of the fact that this courthouse is up and running. The lights are on, the trash is taken out, the internet works, the floors are swept, there's no mold in the walls, and it can accommodate this many people over this period of time. You can just imagine the list, how the list goes. Now, in an availability payment structure, the notion of you are going to be paid on the basis of the payment, the performance, I should say, of this courthouse is a little strange, but the idea is that you roll up all of these performance metrics, that the lights are on, that the trash is out, that the courthouse is, you know, the parking lot is clean and well lit and whatnot. And if all of those are the case, then I'll give you X dollars. That means that it is fully available. X dollars trades us to full availability. But if any one or a number of those things fall short, then the number goes down. So, to go back to GASB, the earlier lack of guidance was that the public entities with respect to the courthouse could say, hey, look, the courthouse wasn't as available as it was supposed to be. In fact, it was so unavailable, we didn't pay the private sector operator any money that month. And that was our contractual deal. Or the next month, they got their act together, and we give them all of the money that we had agreed would be the maximum amount, even though they may have spent more to do it. And so, those fluctuations in payments, sometimes the financial types call them lumpy payments, were just that. They were payments. And a good CFO would spend time budgeting for that over a year and anticipating the worst, but at some point might find that they didn't have to make all those payments. And then you just figured out what it looked like at the end of the year. Well, now GASB has called those payments, however big or however small, debt. And from an accounting perspective, the public entity needs to look at the payments that they're making as effectively installment payments for the purchase of the courthouse. So, we have noted in our some previous stories that there actually is going to be an expected rise in availability payment projects as a result of COVID or expected rise. Because at a certain point, there's an expectation or speculation out in the market for the need for obviously further privatization of projects and how the sector is going to pay for it and what's going to be the appetite for demand risk projects when obviously the short and medium term projections for things like toll roads is not expected to be very good. And so, the alternate is getting things done, privatized. For instance, what are utilities or modernizing that kind of thing? And what we've seen transparently, regardless of speculation, has obviously been university energy projects where we've heard places like I think the University of Maryland, for instance, is looking at an availability payment type structure to pay for their modernization. So, there's plenty. In other words, to make a long story short, there's plenty of projects out there that could be affected by any kind of ruling on availability payments. So, having said that, John Smolin, why does it matter? For the reasons you stated from a market perspective, the notion of passing on the user fee risk to a private sector and back to the toll roads is not working. Let's look at transit, for example. You pay $2 to ride a streetcar or a transit line and then Uncle Sam comes out and says, COVID, scary, stay six feet apart. Well, the projections on ridership for that transit thing anticipated a certain volume of people and a density of people on the train. In fact, the whole point of transit is that it is able to move more people with less geography. Density is, if not the name of the game, it is certainly a big part of the game. And so, you're right. So, if somebody was planning on an infrastructure solution where the expectation was that this fare box type infrastructure financing idea was going to work, that's not going to work. But we still have the problem in the case of transit of moving people from point A to point B. So, yes, increased demand for availability payments. And then GASB comes out and says, oh, by the way, availability payments are a debt. That means, from an accounting perspective, that if you have made promises, you, the public sector, have made promises in other contracts that potentially were financed, say you borrowed some bond money to build a, you know, I don't know, playground. And then one of the covenants that you make in the transaction with the bonds is that your debt to your revenue ratios would not exceed a certain number. Well, now all of a sudden you have a bunch of things going in the debt, which means the calculation for your debt service, in this case coverage ratio, would be the accounting term, is different than anticipated. Your knee-jerk reaction is going to be, well, I can't do availability payment deals until I get a handle on whether or not I'm already violating these covenants under my existing deals, which cover a number of things. I mean, municipalities, not unlike businesses, are doing a whole lot of things at once. So, the job of the financial folks is to keep track of those things so that they don't find themselves in default or perhaps even worse, find themselves with worse credit ratings because they can't keep track of where they are relative to their other debt type commitments. But the other more egregious issue is if there are statutory impositions on these municipalities or the states themselves, for that matter, about how much debt they can carry. And I think the point is that there's going to be a lull while people figure out which way is up, but more importantly, there's going to be a sense that they can't do much more because they have to balance their availability payment type infrastructure approaches against all the other commitments that the municipality or the state is trying to undertake. So, in many ways, the cynical view once upon a time was these, quote, unquote, off-balance sheet type contractual arrangements were really leaving in the discretion of the CFO just good housekeeping of their business, and they were reporting bona fide debts. Now, Gatsby comes from the outside and says, we don't really essentially trust you on this. We're going to make you call them debts. And so, those management strategies that may have carried some momentum to build, say, a pipeline of infrastructure solutions goes away. To circle all the way back to the beginning of the answer, in an environment where a demand risk project is not attractive, that means people in the market who might deliver that project aren't going to come and answer your RFP. So, you have an infrastructure problem. You have an environmental market situation that doesn't lend itself, no pun intended, to a demand risk approach. And then now you have new guidance from the Accounting Standards Board that says, hey, government people, now you need to look at all of your availability payment deals as debt. So, it's going to put the brakes on things for a while until things shake out. That or, perhaps optimistically, Gatsby gets more feedback or some more reconsideration about the public policy implications of this view is, and then does a two-step and comes up with a way to say, well, these kinds of availability payments are debt, and these other kinds of availability payments aren't. And then people like me get to structure deals accordingly. So, editorially, John Smullin is of the opinion that more discretion is generally good and that you could, a municipality or a state can spend a lot of really good resource time trying to find a good, sensible CFO to keep track of these things. I've been in conversations with CFOs in the past where they have their own conservative views about how to do that, irrespective of what Gatsby says about whether or not APs are or aren't on debt. And there's an or, John. There's an or there. What if there's a federal infrastructure bill? And this is where we transition to the second part of our discussion. Obviously, the House introduced their bill on June 3rd, the service transportation projects over a five-year period. It's been marked up. And then there was a rumor circulating this week that there was going to be a $1 trillion federal infrastructure plan coming from the White House. So, you know, just getting to – not getting to the nitty-gritty of when anything is going to get approved, because I think we've been down this road way too many times. I'd like to just get your view on whether anything that's circulated out of these two bills, one at the House, one at the Senate, or some things that are being contemplated by another White House bill, if any of this is – if anything is pragmatic to you in terms of just solving the funding gap that's out there for U.S. infrastructure, just to take it to a broader level, and then we'll get into more specifics after that. Sure. To the very direct question, is there anything pragmatic in this? And I think the answer is yes. I think, just like anything else, there are people that are a whole lot closer to this on a day-to-day basis with their offices, you know, right next to Capitol Hill and on first-name bases with all of these members of Congress and Senators and so forth. I'm not that guy, but I am a guy watching, and I'm a guy who knows the people who are talking to those people. And I also feel like I know that everybody knows that the views of the practitioners and the participants really are going to be the tails that wag the dog with some of the stuff on the periphery being the things that everybody pays attention to in the press. So, the direct question to you is yes, I think there are some pragmatic aspects that actually cross the bills in terms of what they want to see encouraged as a public policy matter and what they think are good, meaningful returns on the investment of the government, however big or however small. Excellent. Thank you. So, one of the things that was introduced was the vehicle's mile travel pilots that was contemplated. The House bill would double the funding for this program. Essentially, it tracks vehicle miles traveled and, you know, levies a tax based on that number. And people were looking at this as sort of a replacement for the gasoline tax, you know, as it's a little bit harder, sorry, less of a revenue source than before due to the rise in fuel efficient hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, and all that kind of stuff. What's your thoughts on this particular program? My view on vehicle miles traveled is that I think that if there's a vector, the vector is pointing generally in the direction of this where we're going, if only for the pragmatic problem of the demise, ultimately, of the essentially the project financing strategy for the original interstate highway system. So, the crash course is, as you kind of alluded to, once upon a time, there was a big number that was a gas tax attached to a small number, which was the gallon of the price of a gallon of gas in cars that got 10 miles per gallon. And we've advanced now to the point where that number, the federal number, is effectively the same since I think it's 93. The price of gas has gone up. And accordingly, the ability of cars to be gas efficient for federal and just for market reasons has gone up drastically. The numbers go down. There's no money. That was the strategy. There has to be a new strategy. And the one that's the most viable is the vehicle miles traveled. There's, you'll hear it in other contexts called the mileage-based user fees. And I think this is an example of what we're going to see when we look at these bills where, in many ways, different words have considerable overlap. And one party, frankly, says one thing and another party says another. But the vehicle miles traveled is going to be a really good tool to get there. And I think where the battle is going to be is the minute at which the imposition of the number for your vehicle miles traveled, essentially tax, becomes a discouragement on people traveling. Somebody somewhere is modeling this. And when they get to the number that says, at this point, people will stop driving. At this point, people won't stop driving. Somewhere in between those is where the conversation is going to go. I think you can predict that the folks that are more on the business-friendly side of our legislative branch are going to want to have a safe cushion where that replacement will be a seamless replacement between essentially a gas tax and a BMT. And people will continue to plug along on the theory that the economy will expand. Then the people on the other side that are going to be more public policy, from environmental and a we need to encourage the market to get away from gas, are going to want that number to be higher to force the market to transition to the more efficient vehicles. Now, the corollary challenge, which is a good challenge for me as an infrastructure lawyer, John, to be candid, is if the latter group wins and BMT starts really kind of taking off, we're just kind of shifting where the infrastructure money is going to go. I don't think that it's going to be replenishing our infrastructure funds. It's going to be redirecting our infrastructure funds and adding a new infrastructure class that we're going to need to deal with in earnest, which is going to be a charging infrastructure. There was an article that I had picked up in a news feed, I want to say yesterday or today, about how a West Coast freight EV charging infrastructure would require a pretty full recharge every 50 miles. And so, is that infrastructure for the charging infrastructure, do we have an energy infrastructure to match that? Are we prepared to have 50-mile increment charging stations? And what is giving way? And what are we doing with the infrastructure we already have there? So, we have BMT that's going to create more money, but that more money is going to have to go to more or different or additional, if you will, infrastructure types. And that's where I think all of the magic of our public policy frames on capital are going to have to sort that out. Interesting. So, just another element I wanted to get to was also introduced in the House Bill was the Project of National Regional Significance Program, which allows all of a sudden passenger and commercial rail eligible for grants. Wanted to get your thoughts on how pragmatic that proposal was at this point. Well, I appreciate the question. I think it's an interesting timing to raise and keep the profile of rail up. I think in the abstract that a public policy view that has advocated on the Democrat side that the Representative DeFazio policy statements is we need to have a multimodal view on these things. And there's an exclusion of passenger and commercial rail from these, but they serve a purpose to move people and freight around the country, which is a situation that creates an economy. That's great, except we have COVID and we have other governmental impositions that are causing the practical conceptions of these, I think, to be disfavored. And I think for very reasonable reasons. That being said, it could be inferred that we don't want COVID to make us short-sighted. Maybe there are ways to reconfigure and rethink how we encourage multimodal travel such that we can keep the lessons that we'll have learned from all of this, God help us when we get through it, and diversify our transportation modes on a theory that none of them will be so detrimentally impacted as has been the case now, rather than in an either or, maybe it's an all of the above, which I think is fairly consistent with the size of their government spending portion of the bill itself. Now, speaking as an infrastructure lawyer, I think it's just a great idea. I think that making grants in favor of one mode over another mode, despite it being a statement of public policy, really is not the right approach to infrastructure. The market, in many ways, I think should dictate the infrastructure, so why not be a little more agnostic about the mode and let the competition that greets any particular mode or suggestion really drive the will of the people in terms of how it is that they want to move around and from where. Interesting. Yeah, this comes amidst a couple of aggressive HSR proposals or high-speed rail proposals that were out there in 2018, 2019, the biggest one being the Dallas to Houston, Texas Central. I know that's before 2019, 2018 as I think about it. But and then the California HSR concept, which was reduced over time to where it's a more manageable or smaller rail proposal, which is just some things we're going to be keeping a watch on, especially as the economy recovers or when it recovers. Anyway, John, were there any other concepts you wanted to raise within these bills or anything that caught your eye? I know we discussed resiliency being an interesting element that was out there, but I'd let you just bring that up. Well, I appreciate that, John. There were two. That was one of them. I had said earlier that one of the things that kind of gets obscured between the partisan rollout of these and sort of the interaction in particular on the House side between, you know, there's the Invest in America Act bill and then Representative Graves come out with his, I can't remember what it's called, START, I think something like that. I haven't written it down. But the point is they're talking, the STARTER Act, they talk about a lot of the same things, but they have to have a kind of a marketing feature about it. And I had suggested earlier that sometimes there's, you know, VMT versus mileage-based user fee. There's kind of the same view here. Those who are advocating for resiliency and those who are advocating for lifecycle maintenance and rehabilitation. Well, in many ways, those are two sides of the same coin. And I think that that creates an opportunity for common ground. Now, I've never been a senator or a congressperson. Who knows whether or not I would ever have been a good one. But my guess is that when they close the doors, that once they get past the vocabulary, they find that they're talking largely about the same things, and that's how the gristmill produces the bill. And in the case of a focus on resiliency, that is a anticipatory and preparatory way to reduce the need in the out years when you're not entirely sure what sort of funding you're going to have, that there's going to need to be a sudden influx of a lot of money to repair something. And furthermore, it's also another, the connotation is the protection of the asset that you're investing in the here and now. So, I don't think either party is going to have objections with that. It just appears that the Republican side, and particularly in President Trump's, I guess, proposal, is that this notion of devoting towards fixing our existing infrastructure is, in many ways, we should have been resilient before. And there's nothing wrong with that. So, do you put the dollar one on fixing what you have or dollar one on putting a wall around what you have and then deciding to fix it later? Those are details. Those aren't philosophical issues. The second thing that struck me about this is I think it's fundamentally, and this should be no surprise, it's fundamentally about where the money comes from and when. The President's view, as far as I can tell, is that an infrastructure stimulus should largely be generated from the investment by the private sector. And that is great. I'm in public-private partnerships a lot with my practice. And so, the principle there is in a relationship between the public and the private sector and an investment opportunity for the private sector, but with expectation of a return. And the return on the investment, to our earlier point, can either come some or all from the demand, the actual utilization of the asset. But more often than not, based upon the size and the complexity of these things, it's going to be coming from the government. So, an investment under President Trump's proposal is private sector investment. And that's great for early money, but there's still the prospect and the need. And frankly, it's appropriate for a longer-term return on the investment in exchange for the delivery of that. That's government money. Now, on the flip side, you have the Representative DeFazio-led Invest in America Act idea, which is we need to put government money in it now. And so, it doesn't emphasize the private sector investment, per se, but it is going to be involving private sector contractors who are delivering it. So, it's a little bit of a contrast between pay me now or pay me later, or how it is that we weed out payments over time. I will freely admit I have some bias that if the complexity of the project, comma, and the size of the project, comma, and frankly, the urgency of the project, require people to be thoughtful about getting it done now, then a private sector investment type approach is probably the smart move. And that investment is less money now, more money later, all things being equal. If there's more work a day, transform our infrastructure approach, then the government has a bit more of a luxury of being able to just pay for it as it goes. So, that seems to me to be lost in all of this. Is it private money or is it public money? It's all public money. It's just how much public money and when is it public money, which leads to the age-old, forever, always been the problem, always the issue. What are the pay-fors under these situations? I'm thinking of the last time we were talking about Democrats and Republicans sitting in the same room. We were talking about, you know, the, was it $1.5 trillion 2008 or 2018 meeting? Yeah. And they all, again, went to the White House and they came out and said, we came up with a number, but we couldn't figure out how to pay for it. It's the same, it's the same thing here. It doesn't really matter what the number is. It should matter what it is we're trying to embrace. And it really should be thought about how much money and when. And ideally, again, showing my bias, the ability for a private sector investor or a private sector contractor to count on the flow of that money over time. And we get to do that. And I think you're going to get really competitive deals. Probably the borrowing costs will go down because the risk premiums will go down and we'll scoop out of this issue. Well, well said, John. And I think that's going to be about all the time we have for today's program. So, John Smolin, we thank you for taking the time to appear on today's program. And thanks for tuning in. And we'll be back in a couple of weeks. Brook out.

I'm John Burke, America's Editor for Information. And today we take a broader view on the telecom space in both the U.S. and Brazil. Joining me today is Brett Lindsey, President and CEO of broadband provider EverStream, a portfolio company of A&P Capital. John Mock, Partner and Managing Director at Digital Colony, Head of Global Data Center Strategy. And he worked on recently an acquisition of Brazilian-based data center owners, Gala Data Centers, at the end of April. Also joining me is Information News Editor Matt O'Brien and our Brazilian reporter Gabriela Valente. All right. Thanks, John. Thank you for that. Good afternoon, Brett. How are you doing today? Fantastic. Thanks for having me. No problems. My first question, I would like to know, you know, the dynamics and drivers behind fiber optics as a defensive play during the pandemic and what's more than likely an economic recession. When I think about it from an infrastructure fund perspective who are typically investing in very hard assets like airports, parking garages, toll roads, things like that, the opportunity that communication infrastructure gives them is it's virtually both recession-proof and COVID-proof. And what I mean by that is no matter what is happening in the kind of whether it's socioeconomic, economic, any of the indicators that are going on, having infrastructure in the communication space is something that kind of just steadily performs. And the beauty of it is that it's also something that's growing exponentially. When you look at fiber specifically, it is the only mechanism that allows for all of the key what I'll call tailwinds behind the communications infrastructure space. So if you want to deploy 5G, that requires fiber. If you're going to build the new biggest data center, whether that's regional or hyperscale, it requires fiber. If you're going to be moving things as an enterprise customer to the cloud, that requires fiber. The data center business, especially on the regional level, has kind of they've been talking about the death of the regional data center and everything's moving to the cloud. And that's just not true. What we see with enterprise customers is they're wanting a fiber asset that connects all of these things together for them because they're using different systems and software and applications that require fiber. So from our perspective, fiber is one of those future-proof assets because nothing is coming behind it. And people can talk about 5G all they want, which is great, and is amazing at making an end-user experience better. But it's not going to drive corporate networks. It's not going to be something that replaces fiber optic networks that are used by every large carrier and enterprise customer across the globe. Interesting. So it's the connecting tissue for this whole ecosystem of telecom infrastructure, data centers, and towers, et cetera. Interesting. We've seen a flurry of activity of fiber investors either building or acquiring fiber networks. So one of the things I want to know is what's fetching a premium between dark and lit fiber, and if you could explain why? Do you mean from the standpoint of companies that are being acquired, what has more value when somebody is acquiring that company or just the value of the services? I guess from an acquisition perspective. Okay, sure. So first off, you're not going to buy telecom assets, or those telecom assets are not going to drive high value if they're not fiber rich. And what I mean by that is if they don't have dense fiber networks that are going all through a specific area. So pick Cleveland, Ohio, as an example. In that market, we have several thousand route miles of fiber that are stitched across 59 separate counties servicing five separate what would be legacy telephone operating companies. And so for us, by having kind of this ubiquitous fiber footprint in that market, somebody that's looking to acquire a market would say, okay, great, that's a rich asset. You've got lots of fiber. It's dense. It's able to reach customers. It's available for providing services to the wireless carriers as well as the more traditional wholesale provider. So having fiber is key. The difference between a business that's doing a lot of business in dark or lit is really just on the customer base. And so I think what you're seeing is for an EverStream, for example, less than 3% of our revenue is driven off of dark fiber. Most of our revenue is off long-term contracts with enterprise and carrier customers that are paying a monthly committed amount for years into the future. On the dark fiber business, you may have some of that. So, for example, Zayo does a lot of business in the dark fiber space. And that's good because, obviously, it drives a lot of monthly recurring revenue and they're very long-term contracts as well. But you don't have as many customers to go after buying dark fiber as you do buying lit services. If you think about it, every business in America is paying for lit services to someone, an AT&T, a Spectrum, a Charter, Comcast, whomever. And so for us, when you look at investing in a business like an EverStream or a First Light or a Segra, some of these other companies that are similar to EverStream, you look and say, okay, what is the size of the opportunity? And so if I'm an infrastructure fund looking at the communication space, I want to understand what are the size of the markets that they're in, what does their fiber footprint look like, and then what is the total addressable market in those cities so that I know, gosh, EverStream and brand new markets that they just built out only have a few points of market share, but they've got $2.5 billion of total addressable market share that they can go after over the next five years. And so I think these infrastructure funds are looking at these assets saying, okay, great, they checkbox our asset classification, long-term assets, in the ground, physical assets, but the growth trajectory in a communication space is so much more significant than it is in airports. You're not going to be able to like go do something at your airport and all of a sudden increase your revenue by 100%. That is a very kind of slow growth sector. Very safe, but kind of a slow growth, but maybe not so safe when you have something like COVID happen, obviously. So what we've seen in a communication space, you know, going through the recession in 2008, going through COVID, going through what I'm sure is going to be an economic downturn across the U.S., that's not slowing my business down. And I think so a lot of infrastructure funds that don't own communication assets are going to be looking at that in a more meaningful way because they're witnessing other infrastructure funds doing well with them. Understood. Gotcha. Along those same lines, what are, more generally speaking, where are the big risks and challenges the industry is facing as it looks to grow its network through organic or acquisitive activity? You know, I think the challenges sometimes are fairly self-inflicted. So from my perspective, if you're in the communication space and you have fiber assets and you're not growing, then you're doing something wrong. Because if you have fiber assets, the growth and need for the services is growing exponentially every year. So you really have to have the will to grow your business and you have to have access to capital. So if you look across our sector, the businesses that are doing the best are clearly the ones that, A, have active sales forces, have dense, rich fiber networks, and have an amazing capital partner. So for us, having the partnership that we've had with A&P where effectively we're coming to them and saying, okay, great. We have an existing business model that's working very well. We went to them and said, we have a greenfield market opportunity for you. We believe we can replicate exactly what we've done in two states and take it to eight by going and building fiber networks on our own. And we're going to even seed those markets by looking for small bolt-on acquisitions. And so that's what we've done. In almost every market that we've gone into, we've tried to find a small bolt-on to pick up a customer base, some talent, some small amount of assets through that acquisition, and then continue to invest and build off of it. And that's allowed for us to, you know, in a very short timeframe from, you know, a year ago, kind of early 2019 to now, to have gone from effectively two markets to now eight cities that are up and running with sales forces, building fiber, delivering revenue and growth. And so it really gets down to, I think, the team and your access to capital and the challenges are really just, can you find the people to drive the business the way that you need to? Okay, gotcha. Do you have any additional views on industry consolidation in the fiber industry, you know, going forward? Definitely think it's going to happen. I mean, you know, there's been rumors going back to February of this year that you would see, for example, of the kind of larger regional carriers. So you've got Everstream in the Midwest and you have Bluebird kind of in the kind of Midwest, but, and, and, and further West, you've got Segra that's kind of in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, Unity's in the Southeast. You've got the First Light up in the Northeast. And so all of us kind of come close to each other, but don't cross into each other's territory because it doesn't really make sense. We, there's no reason to compete against somebody that's just like us. You want to be going after the business with AT&T and Charter and those folks. So I would imagine at some point you were going to see some further consolidation. But, you know, a lot of these, every one of the transactions that I just mentioned are now owned by an infrastructure fund that has a fairly long-term horizon. And so are they really going to go buy something else that, you know, changes their, their market dynamic and their expectations for that specific investment? I'm not sure. And I think you're frankly going to see as those businesses come up for sale, that you're going to have new infrastructure players that don't own assets in the U S coming and bidding up those multiples as well. So I don't know that if I was to give you my crystal ball view, I don't think in 12 months, you're going to see, you know, half of those people, you know, getting married and, and becoming one. I think you're going to see over the next 24 months that most of us are still kind of going our own way. I say, well, something for us to, to keep an eye on for certain. Brett, in early April you and I talked about the credit markets remaining open for, for fiber companies. Do you, has any of that changed since then? Since we last talked about it? No, I mean, you know, so we closed on our most recent debt financing on April 2nd, I believe it was, and you've seen a couple other large data center deals done. There were a few people that may be scaled back their asks during the middle of really the, the beginning of the COVID epidemic. But on a go-forward basis, I think you're starting to see the markets kind of open back up. And, and really there's just so much demand in our space. And, and because of the kind of this whole aura around 5g and, and what people know is going to have to be just a massive amount of capital investment. When people are talking about winning contracts to provide those types of services, those are very bankable. I mean, you know, folks, folks are excited to put money to work in those because, you know, they're, they're dealing with big, great customers, i.e. AT&T, Verizon, Timo. And, and they view those as a great credit risk. So the opportunity to put money to work in companies like ours that are building key infrastructure that supports the carriers, which they're all excited about. And then when we layer in a mix of enterprise businesses and again, good credit risk, large customers, long-term contracts, it feels like a pretty safe place to be. Gotcha. Well, you know, what about going forward? You know, we've heard bankers cautioning their clients to get into the market now because of the extreme uncertainty stemming from, you know, COVID-19, and maybe the related economic difficulties down the road that everyone's talking about. So what do you see happening with getting financing for fiber activity, for fiber builder acquisitions over the next few months and through the rest of the year? I think that it's actually going to be as straightforward as it's been for the last several years, because these are very, and I don't mean to simplify, but very rote, repeatable businesses. You build fiber, you add customers, you build them, repeat. And people that have been doing it well and can show consistent performance are going to have the capital markets available to them. Now, if you've only got 5 million of EBITDA, probably going to be difficult, but when the bulk of the people that are out there that are actively growing are in kind of that, you know, 50 to a hundred to 150 million EBITDA range, that feels pretty safe and secure. And when they've got a big backlog of pent-up demand from customers, they know that money is going to immediately be put to work and that it's for success-based capital use. I don't think there's going to be an issue getting funding for those endeavors. Gotcha. Makes sense. I mean, I think, well, obviously the COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant impact on a lot of businesses. If someone is thinking about the impact on the communications, infrastructure space, it has been very minimal. I mean, we're all considered essential businesses. We have kept our offices open. We've kept our people working. We're actually built more fiber in the month of April than we've ever built because frankly, there weren't as many people on the roads and there aren't as many people, you know, next to the telephone poles and all the things we have to do. So I think we've seen in general across our sector, a pretty massive amount of investment going into the ground in every area of the country while this has been happening and that's not going to be slowing down. So if anything, I think when something like this happens and more people are working from home versus their office, the demand on that infrastructure is getting, you know, even bigger than it was. And so I think you're going to see both enterprise customers and carriers continuing to invest in their infrastructure because they want to be better prepared for the next time something happens. And so we've seen an uptick. We've seen better bookings in Q2 than we had in Q1. And I don't think that would have been expected. I think people would have figured that people are not making decisions. They're kind of, you know, hunkered down waiting for this thing to pass. And instead we're seeing people really starting to think about, okay, how do I make sure that this, these types of things don't negatively impact my business? And we've seen a bigger uptick than we were expecting. Wow. Interesting. Well, Brett, thank you so much for that input. Much appreciated. Very valuable. And John, I'll turn it over to you. Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the time today, Brett. My pleasure. So thanks for that. As deal flow in the telecom space increased in 2019, it was apparent that the drive for data center growth was increasingly, was increasing in Europe. And there was also more room for growth in core Latin American geographies as well. Hence the Scala data center sale, which took place at the end of April. Here to discuss this and other trends is Gabriela and John. With that, I will let you guys take it away. Gabriela, go for it. Hello guys. John, thank you. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to discuss, start this discussion by discussing the local market. So why invest in Brazil data center market? And I know you guys are already expanding the business. So what kind of growth opportunities do you see over here? Well, Gabrielle, thank you very much for, for inviting me today. You know, we are, have been watching the Brazilian market as part of a broader Latin American strategy for some time. The interesting thing about data centers and the local market, as you mentioned, is we see a real growth opportunity. You know, stepping back and thinking about the opportunity here data centers is probably more closely tied to the growth of the digital economy. If you would, the use of digital content, digital applications, you know, mobile devices, video, versus the broader GDP index. And so while the market currently might be having a stutter, right with everything going on in the world, we're actually seeing significant growth around this digital content, this digital transformation. If we think about some of the metrics we're tracking, you know, Brazil's GDP is 3.5 trillion. So it's a, it's a substantial business, the seventh or eighth largest market in the world. When you think about how digitally engaged Brazil is, it's number two or three for Instagram, number three or four for Facebook globally. It's very engaged around this sort of digital content. And so that's why we think that the market has a real growth profile that we can capitalize on. The last thing I would say about our broad strategy here is we're looking at the growth of content. As I mentioned, we're seeing demand for incremental infrastructure. And so some of the largest cloud and content platforms globally that we've worked with across our platform are actually pushing us to expand in Brazil and expand across Latin America as a way to give them sort of a trusted partner to deliver content in those markets. And so we think that Brazil is actually underserved today when you look at fiber, cell towers and data centers specifically. So how would that expansion be like? So you're planning inorganic? How do you plan to finance new acquisitions or are you looking for a partner maybe? Great question. And I would say broadly the answer is yes. We are in the business. And so I'm a partner, as they mentioned, at Digital Colony. We're a global platform focused just on communications infrastructure. So we look at all the components of the business. We look at all the data, we look at all the data that we have. It's just on communications infrastructure. So we look at all the component parts of the plumbing, if you will, for the Internet. So whether it's Google, Amazon or another entity, we try to be the agnostic provider of the infrastructure. They need to deliver their content to the consumer. We're growing through development of new campuses. We always like to build from the ground up where we can. We are looking at M&A opportunities, ways to tuck in and accelerate our growth. We're thinking about different markets around Sao Paulo, different markets around Brazil in addition to Sao Paulo, and actually other markets in Latin America. So again, I jokingly, the answer is yes, in terms of how we would look at that. We really try to be thoughtful in every case about how we create great returns and really build a good business. You know, we, as much as we look like a private equity firm, we're really business builders and we try to partner with strong management teams to give them the resources, the best practices, the Rolodex and the capital needed to grow. And you're pretty much focused on Sao Paulo region right now. So what region would be the next one inside Brazil? Yes, Sao Paulo was a natural place to start. I mean, as I mentioned, Brazil is the gravity of the economic engine of Latin America and Sao Paulo is approximately 40% of the GDP of Brazil. And so that was a natural place to begin. You know, we look at other markets in Brazil, when you move up to Combinas, for example, or Fortaleza where they have the subsea cables coming in from many markets, or Rio de Janeiro, which is a smaller market, but a really interesting and important market. When I think about other markets outside of Brazil, again, there's a number of neighboring country opportunities, whether it's Colombia or Chile or Mexico or potentially Argentina. So again, we think that while Brazil is a very different market, a different language and a very independent and proud culture, the region really is underserved. And there's an opportunity to provide a solution for infrastructure really across Latin America. And we are in the middle of this pandemic with the COVID-19 crisis. Everybody's working at home. This situation somehow increased the assessment of opportunity for you to invest in Brazil? It did. We began this conversation with Wall last year. So it wasn't something we did very quickly. We worked with them very closely to carve the business out, and we're proud to have Wall and the group of companies there as our client going forward in the business. And so excited about that partnership. As I mentioned, we began looking at this last year, well before the COVID crisis, but we had confidence and moved forward in the transaction, as did they. And we were really glad that they were comfortable closing the transaction despite the global volatility. What's interesting about data centers, and when you think about the impact of COVID, there's a lot of things that are coming out of this. But I believe one thing that's really impacting my business and the business we have on infrastructure, is there's been a step function of demand. It's really proven out the resilience, the importance of this infrastructure or this new digital economy. We're seeing substantial growth in fiber traffic. We're seeing applications like video conferencing, programs like Zoom, they're growing several thousand percent in terms of new users in a month. We're seeing demand really across all mobile devices and across fiber routes. And all that content is moving into data centers. And so data centers are really benefiting from that as well. And from an investor standpoint, we're seeing our investors really migrating and pushing their capital to safe markets around data centers. It feels like a safe harbor over the last several months in terms of the market volatility broadly. So I think investors are aware of that. They're aware of that sentiment. So there are a number of investors that have approached us about asking to participate in thinking about how we grow our business on a global basis. It sounds really promising. Do you see any challenges ahead? Well, I always try to look around corners and think about what could go wrong. Fundamentally, we think this is an important business. We are the point where the technology meets the dirt and meets the buildings. So there's a very local component to it. So we want to be a good partner. There's significant energy that's used in these buildings. We want to use energy thoughtfully and try to make sure we have a green or carbon-neutral footprint where we can. We try to make sure that we always deliver the best quality service and make sure that we are focused on the customer solution. Because at the end of the day, we're providing a service to our customers. And if we don't deliver that service and meet their expectations, our customers will go somewhere else. And so, look, we feel very fortunate to be in a growing business and well-positioned during this significant digital transformation, if you will, of the broad economy. But we don't take it for granted. We saw that you established Scala as hyperscale. When looking at expansion, are you going to be looking strictly on hyperscale or are you looking to mix it up at some point between hyper and edge down the road? It's a really good question. So, I would say for the, you know, it's almost if you can imagine a hub and a spoke. So, right now, we're focused on these hub locations, which are very sizable campuses where you get scale power. And we work with very large cloud platforms, very large enterprises. You know, that's our scale, hyperscale strategy. We do, in other markets, have edge businesses that are focused on working with customers to deliver either modulars or, you know, data centers and sort of developing markets or tier two, tier three markets. And so, we will look at that strategy, always trying to sort of be aware of where the market's going and sort of have to make an assessment. So, whether that's the same business, a sister company that actually has a lot of the same customers and benefits or overlap, I think we'll have to determine that over time. So, I don't really have a view yet, but I would tell you that we are keenly focused on watching that market as it develops across Latin America. Thank you for that. And then, looking at the development at data centers, it's always good to get a check-in as to where things are in terms of renewable initiatives and partnering with solar and, you know, renewable developers in terms of powering the data centers. Is that something that's starting to grow within your footprint and from a Greenfields perspective? It's been very topical. You know, we have a program around trying to sort of, you know, give back to the community. We just announced, in fact, yesterday that our tower business in North America has gone completely carbon neutral, and so we're very proud of that fact. We've also made very large acquisitions around this strategy globally. We just did a 180-megawatt campus in Europe. It's the largest data center campus in Europe, and that is completely green and carbon. It's carbon neutral. And so we are definitely focused on this as part of the strategy. I think what's interesting about green as an initiative and renewable energy is while it was something that companies were thinking about and talking about for many years, I believe now they're making economic decisions to actually effectuate that change. So our customers are asking us and telling us they would prefer to be in a green environment or prefer to have a renewable footprint, energy footprint where possible. Utilities that can provide us the best mix of power possible. We've done some projects with solar companies. I would say that sometimes still it's hard to scale renewable energy like solar to the scale that we need for the data centers. You can imagine we measure data centers in tens of megawatts, and a megawatt could be worth or equal to 1,000 homes. It could be a very substantial community. And so to create the solar energy generation to support that can be difficult, require a very large footprint. Interesting. Yeah, we've obviously observed a trend in our coverage of the Latin American markets that renewable projects are getting done, even with economies struggling right now. So that's sort of what got my focus on that. All right, good stuff, John. Thank you for joining us today. I really appreciate your time. And please tune in for the next edition of the Crossroads Podcast. I definitely will. I appreciate it. Thank you guys for having me, and I will look forward to hearing you guys soon. Great, thanks.

I'm John Burke, America's editor for Information News. Joining me today is Latin American editor, Jonathan Carmody. Next for her Crossroads debut, our Brazilian colleague, Gabriella Valente. And finally, our USP3 reporter, Abigail Muller. Welcome to the podcast, guys. Thanks for having us. Before we get going, just wanted to invite everyone to join us for a webinar being held next Wednesday on May 20th at 11 a.m. We're all a chair, a panel with D.J. Gribben of Stone Peak Infrastructure Partners, John Hibbert of the Georgia DOT, and Jennifer Allmendt of Transurban to discuss the P3 prospects during and after COVID-19. If you go to Information's LinkedIn page, you'll get more information on how to register. So this morning started off with a bang because it came out of Europe. French asset manager, Tika Howe Capital, entered exclusive talks to buy infrastructure developer, Star America. I'm apologizing now for my mispronunciation of the name, but I'm pretty sure I did. Anyway, this continues in ongoing consolidation wave, powering institutional capital with Greenfield's developers, which include CDBQ's purchase of a majority stake in Plenary Americas, announced a few weeks ago, and earlier Sun Life's buyout of Infrared Capital Partners. Meanwhile today, Irish domiciled mainstream renewables, as exclusively reported by Sparkspread, is searching for equity partners for its platform of renewable projects in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The marriage of the French asset manager is a little bit strange in that it's marrying a Eurocentric asset manager to a very specific domestic developer of Greenfield's projects in the US. Prior to this deal, Tika Howe had no US exposure other than a North American high-yield bond, high-yield funds, excuse me. Star America, meanwhile, has been very active in the P3 space in the US. Their most recent victory was being a proponent for the Howard County Courthouse in 2018. At the same time, it's also in the middle of raising its second fund. Last firm defied with the SEC, indicated it was halfway there at around 300 million of its 600 million target. Lastly, it has diversified away from Greenfield as of late, as its last two investments were a, excuse me, away from P3, I should be more specific. Its last two investments, one was a private data center deal with the state of Indiana. And another one was a behind the meter energy storage business called Demand up in Canada, where Tika Majora's taking that business. Jonathan, I thought it'd be interesting to get your perspective from a Latin American deal flow perspective, because you've seen a lot of these odd marriages of institutional capital into Latin American Greenfield projects. I think that the keyword here is culture. So I kind of wanted to get a sense about what those deals were, and what you've heard about some of the culture behind these deals. So there's a big recent example in Latin America and Mexico where the developer that's owned by Mexico's richest man, Carlos Slim, IDL, sold a stake to two Canadian pension funds, to OTPP and CPP Investments. They've been co-investors for a long time. The two Canadian pension funds started investing in their highways several years ago. And this seemed like it was a natural progression. It seemed like the relationship really grew from those early investments. And as Mexico's market evolved, there appeared to be a better way for them to get involved in the projects beyond just contributing minority stakes to some of the existing toll road projects that IDL had developed. So the interesting thing about this deal in particular is despite the size, it's a $1.6 billion acquisition, and something that closed during the COVID crisis on the 20th of April. There's an extra element to this, where in Mexico they've established a lot of different institutional investment vehicles. Some of the earliest funds were known as CKDs, which were Development Capital Certificates. They then decided that it was time to give more responsibility to the institutional investors to invest abroad, and they developed the SERPIs. They were investment in projects, as the name goes. But those were interesting in that only a few of the fund managers had begun investing those in infrastructure projects abroad. A lot of other institutional managers, people like BlackRock, people like KKR, people like Partners Group, they've been filing SERPIs over the last few years, but mainly to invest in their vehicles. So BlackRock will take money for its funds in the US, KKR likewise. But the interesting thing in this deal with CBP-IB, OTPP, and IDL was they decided to shift some of the assets then into a FIBRA-E investment trust. So this is interesting to see the Canadian pension funds investing in that kind of trust vehicle, which is designed to give benefits to Mexican investors particularly. So that's an interesting one where they get to drop some of the assets into that vehicle and then sell shares in that trust to then kind of raise additional capital that they can use for future investments. The other example is- I guess the advantage at this point, given that transaction, of course, is that it seems like the Afora's or the pension funds down there have obviously a strong institutional memory of investing in these vehicles at this point, right? Yeah. So the CKD funds have been around for several years. I think some of the earliest date-backs were around 2012, 2013. Macquarie was an early investor in these kinds of vehicles, raising capital and making several investments in the core infrastructure sectors. Those funds are now kind of coming to a close, the original ones. So it's going to be very interesting to see how much they've really been successful or not. That's going to be one of the things that we'll be looking over in the next couple of months to see if those funds that are now divesting assets, the original CKDs, are now going to be shown to have been profitable and really great ideas or if they never really worked quite possibly as profitably as we would have expected or hoped. Well, globally, I'd say, Jonathan, from our coverage, it seems like it's a very strong secondaries market that's out there right now, globally, of course. So I'd be curious to see if that money starts to flow or does flow to Mexico on some level. I think people like DepthStone and Goldene are out there just raising massive secondary funds. So it's going to be interesting to see where that money flows. And also, again, is it going to flow to assets in Latin America at some point? Well, those are good questions. And the interesting thing as well is obviously that while we've seen funds like DIF and RDN and Meridian investing in places like Chile and Colombia and Uruguay, there's actually a lot of intra-Latin American investment too. I mentioned the Serpys, one of the Serpy vehicles owned by Mexico Infrastructure Partners, EXE. They've actually made investments in Colombia already. So you've got Mexican institutional capital investing in Colombia. Chilean fund manager, STL Energia Activa, made investments also in Colombia and other countries in Latin America in the energy sector. So you've got interesting directions of capital within Latin America, not just Europeans or Americans coming into the region. I'm sure Gabriela will be able to tell you about IG4, the Brazilian private equity firm investing in Peruvian developer Granja Montero. Now we all know that Granja Montero is one of the largest developers in Peru, but it's had a lot of trouble recently after it became embroiled in the La Pajata scandal. It lost a very large contract with the Southern Gas Pipeline deal that fell through due to that scandal. And it looks like IG4 is taking the opportunity to acquire that Peruvian developer, at least in part, and possibly acquiring a controlling stake in the future. Very interesting stuff. And I will get to Gabriela in a few minutes. Well, I think what's gonna be interesting, and we're gonna get back to this a little bit later in the program, is that in Plenary Americas and Star America, assuming these deals get consummated later this year, and I assume the French regulatory process is a little bit strict by what I recall from the past, but nevertheless, you now have effectively two very well-heeled, well-oiled backers for these development vehicles. But what we know about P3s is that the equity check from the equity investor, when you actually get down to it in the US, is de minimis. This is because of multiple things. You have a very highly subsidized market that is out there for certain projects, like private activity bonds, and a pretty robust private placement market behind it. Corporate bankers will grumble sometimes about that because they're sort of like, well, where do I play? And then I always say, well, where's the equity investor gonna play? But they're in there to be the equity investor, but also helping develop the project. I mean, that's sort of their role. They're playing a couple of hats. But now with these reams of AUM to sort of back them up in these development activities, I kind of wonder if what they look at takes a little bit of a more broader level, whether they start looking at portfolios and more investments like Star America did with its behind-the-meter energy investment, or Star America also did the data centers. What we've seen so far has been a little bit of a disintegration in the P3 market year over year. It just gets choppy. Sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's not. It's gonna be interesting to see once you see all those interests aligned, what the strategic direction's going to be for Star America and Plenary. Is it, do P3s become a little bit less a part of their portfolio in favor of some bigger deals or more deals around private development, for instance? So I think that those are the kinds of things I think about when I look at these deals. It's almost like when infrastructure funds step up and they raise their second or third fund, and all of a sudden they have a $5 billion fund versus the $1 billion fund. You know what that means in terms of the size of the check they're gonna write. Here you have permanent capital, which is a good thing, but it also comes along with it expectations and different expectations. So it's really gonna be interesting to see what happens with these platforms down the road. I'll get back to the P3 space in a second. So over to Brazil. Gabriela, you have been very busy as of late on a number of fronts. It's always a colorful day in the regime of Bolsonaro, but there was a deal yesterday that caught my eye, the sale of a 50% stake in Rodovias do Tietê to a Latache Capital Fund. Tietê, of course, is a concessionaire of about 260 miles of Brazilian highways, also under bankruptcy protection. To no one's surprise, this fund focuses on distressed assets and the transportation sector. And in Latin America, you're gonna find that intersection more often than not. So I can't say I'm surprised by the fact that I'm reading this, but I was just curious, Gabriela, what you've heard more about this transaction and whether there's other transactions like this that are coming. Hi, JB. So this is a very peculiar case because it's a distressed asset and it was in distress before the COVID-19 crisis. So right now, Latache, they have a turnaround plan for Rodovias do Tietê, but they can also renegotiate the balance of the contract with Artespi, who is the regulatory agency for the state of Sao Paulo, is the grantor of the concessions that they own here. So this is a very peculiar case. Latache is planning to do a strong haircut in Rodovias do Tietê. I heard that they are interested in 100% of the concessionaire, but the other 50% belongs to Abé Concessões. And both acquiring Abé Concessões stake and also approving their turnaround plan would have to be discussed with Rodovias do Tietê bondholders. So that's going to be a very complicated path for Latache. Just in terms of them granting the consent of taking over the 50% stake, right? Okay. That is very interesting because, yeah, it's going to be... I've looked at cases like this before and it always becomes a question about, you know, how do the bondholders get handled here, right? Whether there is some kind of pay down, you know, 50% is 50%. So whether there's some kind of pay down, there is going to have to be some pay down associated with this. You know, and probably some exchange behind it into something with maybe a higher coupon. But yeah, that's going to be kind of an interesting thing to watch. Jonathan, what other cases can you think of where we've covered some of these bankrupt roads that you've... I mean, Odebrecht is part of this too, right? Just some of the concessions there. Yeah, they've been selling a lot of assets since they had trouble. Yeah. Big bankruptcy cases continuing. I think they've been negotiating with creditors for some time. You know, one of the other big examples, again, was back in Mexico. Empresas Ica was an incredibly successful developer for a long time. They had an ample portfolio of highway assets, water assets, prisons. They'd won a construction contract at the giant white elephant that was the Mexico City International Airport, but they eventually became cancelled. And when they went into bankruptcy, there was a lot of squabbling around the assets and what would happen. In the end, the lawyers who are handling the case as mediators, they decided to actually ensure that Ica kept as many of its assets as possible so they could sell them at a later date. But what we've been hearing from sources in the market and what we've reported occasionally is that the real salvation for Ica came when a high wealth investor like David Martinez, who is an incredibly wealthy Mexican, it's not entirely clear how he made his money or what he was doing, but he's certainly very wealthy. And he bought B-series shares in Ica, giving himself quite a large stakeholding. And the impression now is that several years after they saved the company from bankruptcy, now that they're going back out into the market, competing for concessions again, he's looking to get his money back. He made a significant investment in the company, several hundred million dollars, I believe it was. And with that in mind, now a few of the assets that they do still have are certainly on the block. And we saw that recently with some of the sales of particularly the water assets and the jails, well, certainly the water assets to one of the institutional funds that we mentioned earlier, XE. Thank you for that, Gabby. I appreciate the perspective. We're gonna just shift over to the US here. A lot happened in the past couple of months in the P3 market. I'd say delays has been the root of all this and for understandable reasons. At the end of the day, they're looking to build projects and it takes site visits and due diligencing. And you can certainly advance a process to a point, but then there's a point where you can't. And I think that's where you're seeing some of these delays come into focus. I think obviously as steep funding and it becomes an issue too, that could be kind of an issue for projects in the pipeline. But what I'm getting to today with Abby is talking about two projects that have been going on for a long time, which is apart from my previous discourse. The Purple Line P3 project, 2016 held as a success, 2020, a tough situation to say the least. There's been lawsuits since the beginning about the project. It went through the Maryland and there was environmental lawsuits since just from the very beginning, just the actual design. And there were cost overruns, which in an LRT project happens, well, every LRT project, I don't know. People I've talked to before said, why can't these consortiums get it right? And I'm like, well, I think they do as best as they can, but it just always winds up being a sense of cost overruns. But the real news was quite recently when the lead contractors filed a notice to potentially terminate their role in the consortium, in the project. It is at the option of the chief sponsors, whether to release them. And they're gonna make a decision within the next month to 90 days, I believe. But Abby, what can you tell us about what went on here behind the scenes? It seemed like the overruns may have, and I think some of it was also motivated in Floor and what their situation is, that the combination really may have triggered this event. Yeah, so essentially the design build team and the design team, which includes Floor, Lane, and Trailer Brothers, they pulled out of the project. There was a clause in the contract which allowed them to pull out with no consequences if delays reached over 365 days, which I don't have a number in front of me, but it's well, well over 365 days at this point. And so, I think it's a good thing that they're not just saying, well, well over 365 days at this point. And then like you said, there's a legal battle between the consortium, the Purple Line Transit partners, who the equity partners there are Meridian and Star America, and they're in a legal battle with the Maryland Department of Transportation, citing delays. They say that they were unable to obtain the time and cost relief that they've been entitled. And that's been going on for years at this point. The project, the bonds were downgraded to BB by both S&P and Fitch. It's, I mean, essentially the continued participation of the whole consortium is unstable and kind of on the rocks right now. And basically, I mean, the project had just experienced delay after delay and cost overrun after cost overrun, and so much so that eventually the design build team said that they had enough. And I assume there was a force majeure incident or related incident that caused the Purple Line Transit partners to file for another potential change order. And that was related to COVID-19. So, I mean, I think it was kind of the perfect storm of bad situations that, you know, this wasn't necessarily specifically coronavirus related, but I definitely think it may have exacerbated the process. And in terms of what's going to happen next, I do think the DB team will be let off. And then I'm not, honestly, it's kind of hard to say. Yeah, two things to add to that. Yeah, we had that the original date of completion was spring of 2022. After the delay request, it was moved to November of 2024. That was a recent, so obviously there's a huge gap of time there. Secondly, for readers of information, they've certainly been made aware of floor situation. They have been among a number of guys that have been retreating slowly but surely from the P3 space. And they've also were very vocal on their last earnings call, being very vocal about the fact that they're going to be in their last earnings call back in March, I believe, that they had received a reverse inquiry or interest in their European concession portfolio and a preliminary interest, if you will, in their U.S. portfolio. And so, I guess, indicated that they were maybe looking around for buyers or maybe there was a reverse inquiry possibly. But it was an interesting comment they made at the time because they're minority holders in all their concessions. So there's really no process to be run effectively. The sale likely is gonna just trade into the people that already own those projects. I can't see at this point, given all that we know about the space, that newcomers would waltz into a 10% stake or 20% stake. Although one attractive thing could be they have a 40% stake in the Gordie Howe, which could be something to someone, maybe for more of the Canadian institutional market to take a look at. That's a bridge that everyone needs to use at some point, not today, of course, but has a very, very long-term concession in place. So that might be something to watch. Anyway, but that's part and parcel of what Floor's doing here, and that this includes Purple Line. So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens there. And to conclude, again, the fallout in USP3 market continuing with the LA Civic Center making the decision a couple of weeks ago, the grantor, the LA Municipal Facilities Committee voted to cancel the project. This is after they already shortlisted the project, which has happened at times. They said they were gonna go back and look at a couple of other options, I guess. And we know we have reported that maybe private real estate becomes part of the next iteration of this project. Maybe it comes to design builds. They did cite overruns associated with the O&M or operations and maintenance costs as being a factor in what caused them to cancel the DBFOM project. I would sort of argue to that point that there's a lot of people in these consortiums and a lot of money and a lot of private project finance banking behind that has supported these projects before. So I still kind of suspect there's other ulterior motives at play here other than an O&M cost overrun. But I guess we'll kind of find out more. But Abby, what have you heard about this one? Yeah, so like you said, the official reason given was that a DBFOM is no longer the best method because of increased estimated O&M costs. They said they found there while preparing the RFP and I guess it just didn't come up before then, which I don't know, feels a little shifty. But essentially from people that I've been talking to, the way that they outlined it was the LA Civic Center was supposed to be the first of seven similar projects or seven government buildings in the same area of downtown Los Angeles that need to be redeveloped. And the city's board of engineers, they are planning to recommend what they want to do next by June 1st. One person I spoke to said it could basically look, they'll potentially release a request for information that would include all of the seven buildings because some of those buildings have a real estate aspect. So the idea is that the RFI would help structure the process in which the private real estate aspect could pay for all or part of it. So if they could do another P3 that way, they could also, they could come back and decide to do it design build or the traditional design bid build. I really don't know what they're leading towards. But yeah, I mean, the observers and people that were actually included in the process were more or less blindsided. They were not told ahead of time that anyone would, or there was any sort of reconsideration. The shortlisted teams, there was a Meridiem team, a Laquari team and a Plenary team. To my knowledge, they had no idea that this was coming. They were called and told ahead of time. Well, sorry, they were called and told ahead of the press release and ahead of the meeting that actually canceled the process. But before that, they did not see it coming at all. This is another project that, I spoke to one person that they said that while coronavirus COVID-19 wasn't explicitly the reason that it was canceled, it most likely did play an impact. Someone opined that does it really look good to spend all this money in a partial privatization given the pandemic? And so, another that not explicitly canceled because of the pandemic, but definitely could have been moved along as a result. Excellent. Well, that is all the time we have for today's program. Wanted to thank my guests and fellow journalists for joining me today on today's program. Stay safe out there. Berk out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-04-30 22:18:30+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### John Laing NorthAm chief talks infra and fed stimulus\n**Episode ID:** 4444\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the May edition of the Crossroads podcast. I'm John Burke, America's editor for information. Joining me today on the program is Anthony Phillips, the regional managing director for John Lang in North America, Jeffrey Manning, managing director of Cone Resident Capital, and Lindsey Gorel, CEO and director of Core Power. We're going to be covering a wide range of topics today in the infrastructure space, ranging from core to good old battery storage. Anthony, we start with you first. Again, thanks for coming on today's program. It's obviously been a busy couple of months for John Lang, particularly in North America and globally. John Lang announced earlier today that Ben Loomis, former form of Infrared Capital Partners, agreed to be the CEO of the company starting in a couple of weeks. Actually, next week. And in North America, you guys have also brought in a communications infrastructure banker in Sebastian Caputo. And then publicly, too, in the last couple of days, there was the announcement of that newer deal with the automated fare collection system P3 in Boston. So anyway, thanks for coming on today's program, Anthony. I wonder if you would first off sort of walk through what's your overview on the economic stimulus so far as it pertains to COVID-19. And do you think even after a couple of rounds here, it'll eventually involve some sort of infrastructure funding? Well, great to join you today, John. And as you know, John Lang's a strong supporter of information news in North America and across the globe. And I hope all that information and your subscribers are keeping healthy and safe in these difficult times. In terms of the stimulus response, I guess what we would say is that it's been fast and it's been big. So far, over $2.7 trillion in economic stimulus has been enacted through three phases, the largest of which is the CARES Act. And this is a much larger injection than the stimulus provided back in 2009. And it provides wide-ranging relief to individuals, businesses, and local government. Notwithstanding the massive stimulus measures to date, unemployment has now reached levels that we haven't seen in a very long time. And states and cities are facing extreme budgetary pressures due to declining revenues. In terms of infrastructure, well, the current administration has consistently expressed a strong desire for infrastructure reform. We absolutely believe that infrastructure investment is a proven tool that government can use for sustainable and meaningful job creation, as well as stimulating the economy. We are hopeful that increased infrastructure investment plays its part in the recovery effort. For this to happen, the third P in P3 is critical partnership. The public and private sectors will need to work together and tailor solutions which will have the most impact, both in the short term during the crisis and then post-crisis. And that leads directly to, of course, John Lang. If you could maybe walk us through what your overall strategy is going to be for the rest of the year. Sure. And just touching on the earlier comment on our new CEO. So as we announced today, we confirmed Ben Looms after a comprehensive search and absolutely delighted to have secured such a highly qualified and capable candidate. In terms of our strategy for North America for the rest of the year, John Lang's purpose really is about creating value for all stakeholders through development, investing, and active management of infrastructure, which really seeks to respond to public needs and improve the lives of local communities. So our strategy is really driven by what we see as the key drivers for new infrastructure, population growth, urbanisation, the role of data in societies, and climate change. So as a Greenfield investor with over 150 projects under our belt today, including many in large-scale projects here in North America, we'd like to think we're well positioned to respond to infrastructure challenges from government. But to put this in the US context, we're really focused on four areas. Firstly, major transportation and social P3s. After a fairly subdued 2019 in terms of new projects to the market, we have seen an uptick in activity earlier this year with the new availability-based projects such as the SR400 in Georgia, Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, and the Sepulveda Pass in LA, as well as some major transit schemes in Canada. So far, these procurements remain broadly on track. Secondly, managed lanes. So we do believe that managed lanes represent an attractive solution to ease congestion, particularly in densely populated and growing cities. And on the back of our investments in managed lanes projects in North Carolina and Virginia, we are committed to the sector, which we expect to expand and are actively pursuing the Maryland Managed Lanes Program. And thirdly, communications infrastructure, and you referred to our recent appointment, which really was in response to what we see or expect to be a rapidly expanding need, particularly given the current situation. So by bringing in Sebastian, we've bolstered our team in the US communications infraspace and are actively exploring a range of both publicly and privately procured opportunities. Finally, energy transition is the other area for us. And these are really two areas within this that we're exploring. The first is energy efficiency, and in particular, the US campus energy solutions, which has been an emerging sector, as well as transportation decarbonization. So, for example, electric buses and supporting infrastructure around that. Interesting. So let's talk about, again, the telecom space in general. I think we've observed so far in the first and second quarter that fiber and towers are very defensible at the moment. They've been executed. There has been some – there was a Canadian RFP, I think, recently for broadband, and that's augmented by yesterday's – or sorry, earlier this week's news about the FCC looking at a $9 billion rural infrastructure fund. There's now sort of the third P, as you pointed out, too, that's showing up quite considerably in telecom as a highly defensible space. How do you – how are you viewing solely John Lang's role in this, and what sort of subsectors are you going to look to expand in this area? Yeah, so at John Lang, we do have a flexible business model, which we believe allows us to transfer our skills and experiences into new sectors such as broadband. Really, our approach is we're not shifting away from a particular risk profile or risk demand. It's actually quite the opposite. I think earlier this year, we made the strategic decision not to pursue new investments in the wind and solar space, but to absolutely clarify, we're committed to energy transition to address climate change, but looking at new and adjacent sectors around that, which I referred to earlier. So our approach really is, in looking at new sectors, is to ensure that the risks are fully understood and that the returns are adjusted accordingly. I think at John Lang, we've been fortunate to have delivered some of the largest and most complex projects in North America, particularly in the transportation space and around the world. So projects like the Denver Eagle, the Managed Lanes projects, and working closely with our delivery partners who are truly market leaders. These relationships are absolutely key to us. So again, I think in terms of profile of new asset classes, really what our focus is to ensure that the risks are fully understood and so that we're making appropriate investment decisions. Okay. Thanks for that. Are there any live projects you'd like to update us on? Sure. So a few days ago, the North Carolina Department of Transportation released their real broadband project. And the DOT-sponsored broadband projects have suffered a few setbacks in the last couple of years. So we see the launch of a new DOT-sponsored project as really positive, not only in terms of a new type of P3 procurement model, but also very timely given the wide-ranging issues with broadband connectivity in many rural parts of the country and dealing with the current crisis. Yeah. You mentioned some of those setbacks that we've certainly covered before. What I noticed about this one was their willingness to be a lot more open about their method of procurement, whereas they were asking responders for different options ranging from DBFOM and on downward to potentially a DB. And I'm kind of wondering if that was in a little bit of a response to what happened in Pennsylvania where they had siloed themselves into a DBFOM. They wound up blowing the project up about a year ago and, you know, turning it into – a year and a half ago, sorry – and turning it into two smaller DB projects. I'm just wondering sort of what your thoughts were with respect to this. Sure. Well, you know, we think it's really important for the private sector to provide the authority with the information that it needs to, you know, to make the right decision as to what the best procurement solution for the project is. And, you know, from our perspective, we'd much prefer that that decision is made as early in the process as possible. So, you know, we fully support the approach that's being taken in. Okay. Well, Anthony, that about ends our part of the program. Thanks so much for coming on today. Appreciate it. Hope we can do it again down the road. Pleasure. Thanks for having me. Great. From infrastructure, we shift over to battery storage. Jeff, Lindsay, thanks for getting on the program today. Jeff, I wonder if you could just kick us off and just talk to us a little bit about Cone Resnick's platform in battery storage and renewables, and then we'll sort of go from there. Terrific, John, and thank you very much for inviting us to participate because within the infrastructure discussion, batteries and energy storage plays a major role in a number of applications. The Cone Resnick Capital story is we are a leading investment bank in the renewable energy space, wind, solar, and storage. We are the FINRA-licensed affiliated investment bank of Cone Resnick, which is one of our nation's largest assurance and consulting firms. And over the last five years, the investment bank has executed nearly $21 billion in transactions. In addition to renewable energies, we also support Cone Resnick's restructuring and dispute resolution practice, which I think will be fairly busy in the next couple of years.

I'm Jonathan Carmody, editor for Latin America, and I have two guests on today to discuss Latin American issues with us. Firstly, we'll speak to Francisco San Clemente, manager of Renovatio Trading in Colombia, and we'll be talking a lot about electricity consumption during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as some of the activity that Renovatio are seeing in the region with regards to renewables. After that, I'll be discussing our first quarter of the league table report with Giulio Comellini from our analyst team. Giulio and I will be discussing some of the important deals and the trends that we identified across the sectors during the first quarter. So to begin, Francisco, welcome to the podcast. Thank you. Francisco, for those who are not aware, could you give a brief description of Renovatio and the two sides of the business? Sure. Renovatio is an European company with headquarters in Portugal. We have presence in Latin America, both in Colombia and Mexico. In Colombia, we're doing really well. We have two lines of businesses or two different companies. One is a wind developing company, which is arguably the most successful wind developer in Colombia, having been awarded around 83% of the capacity that was awarded in Colombia's first renewable energy auction. Then we have an energy trading company, of which I'm a general manager, and we serve or provide electricity to final consumers in the Colombian market. Excellent. Now, it's a very exciting time in the Colombian energy market with the introduction of many more renewables projects. Traditionally, I understand the matrix was dominated by hydro and certain thermal generation plants, which operated more as a backup or as peakers. But could you explain a little bit some of the things that have been happening recently in Colombia regarding the shift to renewables and the auction that occurred last year? Sure. The country and the current government are committed to shift the grid towards more renewable energy. You were writing that we have or we are very heavily hydro-based, about 70 or 80% of our energy, unless there is a scarcity of rain, is provided by hydroelectric plants. But we want to move into renewables, and we have. It took two tries to get the first renewable energy auction last year to be successful because the first one failed. So, we're moving in that direction, but to get to the point where the projects will be developed up and running, it will take a while still, right? It could be two to three years. Let's see if this whole thing of the coronavirus is going to delay the projects or not. I would expect it will, but we also have problems with the construction of the transmission lines, which are going to probably make or move the expected dates of operation of those projects a bit. I see. Yeah, and that's something that we've seen in Mexico as well. There were some initiatives under the previous regime of Peña Nieto to attempt to construct transmission lines through PPP or concession contracts. They were ultimately unsuccessful, but we understand that the government will require new transmission to really relieve some of the congestion in the grid that renewable projects are causing when they come online. Obviously, it's very important to be able to move that electricity around the country to where it's most needed. So, that's going to be a key consideration for Colombia as well, much in the same way that Mexico has that issue. Francisco, could you explain a little bit around the trading business of Renovatio and how that fits into the Colombian energy market in general? Sure. We operate in the two different markets that supply energy to the final user. There are two markets, basically because of regulatory or the way the regulation has been structured. Depending on the consumption of the customer, it will qualify into the regulated market or the non-regulated market. So, basically, it's the state saying, if you're big enough, we understand you're wise enough to negotiate your own terms for your energy. You can negotiate your price and you can negotiate your term. But if you don't consume enough energy per point of energy you supplied, then you fall into the regulated market and it will be the state with a clear guideline that will regulate your price and the terms that you will be consuming energy. Francisco, you've been doing some interesting research around COVID-19, around the coronavirus' impact on energy uses in different countries around the world. I'd love you to share some of that research with us today and let us know what you've been seeing in terms of the decline in usage. And then maybe we can talk a little bit about what that will mean for some of the generators in Colombia and possibly some of the contracts as well. Sure. What I did in my research was a very simple estimation using public data from the different countries. I analysed Spain, Italy, mostly because those were the two main focuses of the coronavirus, as they started after China, obviously. Then Germany and the UK. Germany because it's the engine of Europe and the UK because the UK was being a bit lax in terms of the lockdown at the beginning. Obviously, I analysed the US and in the US I analysed particularly the state of New York and the state of California. And in the Latin American market I analysed Colombia and Peru. And what I did basically was to take the average demand of energy in the period before the lockdowns started, so since the 2nd of February until the 13th of March, and calculated the average demand per day of every single market. And then I would track what the demand would be day by day once the lockdown started in different countries. And what I found, which is quite interesting, I have to say that I haven't adjusted for weather or things like that because I expect that, particularly in the first two weeks, if you see a massive drop in demand it's not going to be because the weather changed, it's going to be probably most likely the effect of the lockdown of the coronavirus. But what I've seen seems to be very consistent across the countries. And what I wanted to see here was first, what could I expect for the trading in terms of the fall in demand? And second, what the economic impact could be in the different countries? Because obviously the drop in demand is explained by the whole industry shutting down, right? Right. Yeah, it's a correlation between the demand from factories, from consumers, and from large-scale retail as well, I'm sure. Exactly. So what I've seen is pretty consistent. One week after the lockdown started in Spain, the demand fell by 9.5%. That would be the week of the 22nd of March. That same week, 22nd of March, obviously the lockdown started earlier in Italy, and also they had some sort of partial lockdown in the north of Italy, in the zone of Lombardia, they make some sort of orange zone. But on this same week, the demand in Italy fell by 17%. And in the north of Italy, it fell by 19%, which is crazy. By that same time, in the US, the demand had fallen only 7%, 2.8% in the California state, and 8.3% in New York. In Germany, it had fell by 6%, in the UK by 5%, in Colombia by 7%, and in Peru by 33%. When you see the week before Eastern, the full week, the demand in Spain had fallen by 19%, in Italy by 24%, and 30% in the north, 12% in the US, 10% in California, and 14% in New York, 11% in Germany, 18% in the UK, 16% in Colombia, and 31% in Peru. So it seems somehow that the trend would be towards a 30% fall in demand if this coronavirus continues, without taking into account possible bankruptcies, right, because that would make it fall even further. And what is going to be the implication for generators on the back of these trends? We're still unaware of how long the coronavirus outbreak is going to affect the economy, how long we'll be under lockdowns, and so how long industry will effectively shut down. So I'm curious, for those who have contracts to buy energy, those who have contracts to sell energy, how is this going to affect the market and how they're doing business? Here's where the type of contracts that you have will become incredibly important, both as a generator and as a buyer of energy. In our case, we have structured our contracts in a way that we cap the energy that we buy at our demand. So as our demand gets depressed, or if our demand gets depressed because we have grown so fast this year, that we're growing faster than the drop in demand. So in net terms, we're flat, right? But if it were to fail 30% because our contract is capped at our demand, the quantity of energy is capped at our demand, we wouldn't have any impact, we wouldn't be buying any excess energy, right? Some others would have contracts where you just have to take or pay, right? If you have a take or pay, if you're a generator, you have a take or pay, you wouldn't suffer unless your counterparty becomes stressed in terms of working capital, right? And if you're the acquirer of the energy, then you have to take or pay that energy, so you will obviously take it and you will sell it in the spot market. Right now, the prices of the spot market are high, so it means that you wouldn't expect any losses on the acquirers of the energy. We've had a very interesting year because even though an official Nino hasn't been declared, the prices of the spot market have been very high throughout the year. Could you give us an example of the price? Yeah, sure. For example, two months ago, we reached highs of about 600 pesos per kilowatt hour. That would be in dollars about 150, 180 dollars per kilowatt hour. There were moments that were that high. If you see the levels of the dams, they are in their historic lows right now. So, it's very interesting because a Nino hasn't been declared, but we are behaving in the same way as the later months of the previous Nino, right? So, eventually it will start to rain and when that happens, the prices in the spot market will go down. So, the energy acquirers that will have to sell all that energy that they cannot sell to their final consumers because the demand has been depressed, could be selling that energy at very low prices in the spot market and losing millions. Right. That sounds like it's going to have a dramatic effect then. Right now, in terms of the project development, are there any issues at the moment around the contracts in terms of being able to advance with the construction of plants? I understand that the country is more or less in a complete lockdown, similar to most of the other countries in the region. Could you talk about if there are any issues around that, around the development of projects right now because of the crisis? Well, what I know is that the government launched a communication asking developers and constructors to explain or to foresee the possible delays or the possible impacts that this lockdown will have on the different projects and they're analysing that information, but it hasn't been published. But I can expect it will have, well, it depends on how long it lasts, this lockdown, right? If we open in one month, in terms of the construction of the projects, I don't think it will have a massive impact. What will probably have a massive impact is the currency. The Colombian peso has been heavily depreciated in the last four months, so it would depend on whether developers have their CAPEX already negotiated, right? And if the price or the exchange rate at which the prices would be translated are already fixed. And if not, they could see a substantial increase in their prices. Okay. Yeah, that's certainly going to be a concern for a lot of developers. Indeed. I've been speaking with a few developers because we want to, in Renovatio, we want to launch the first private renewable energy auction. We want to do that. We want to do that in the second semester of this year. And we've been in contact with several developers to encourage them to participate in our auction and get the market, kickstart the private market. And what we've been hearing is that they're very uncertain at what price they would be willing to sign an energy contract precisely because of the current exchange rate. Okay. That's really exciting. Again, we saw Mexico beginning to run private auctions. And so it seems like a logical step in the development of renewable businesses within Latin America. So that's very exciting news, Francisco. We look forward to hearing more about that. In terms of Renovatio's projects, I know it's not an area you're directly involved with, but is there any update you can give us on the construction of those projects at all? No. Okay. We'll have to invite your colleagues for the next time. Yeah. That's fine. Well, Francisco, thank you very much for your contribution. No, thank you very much for inviting me. And I hope what we share has been insightful. Absolutely. Absolutely. We hope to welcome you back again soon to see if the trend continues, hopefully after the coronavirus lockdown has ended. I will be happy to. Fantastic. Continuing then, we recently published an information news, first quarter 2020 league table report. And here to discuss it with me is Giulio Comellini from our analyst team. Hello, Giulio. Hi, Jonathan. How are you? Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Excellent. Giulio, we were talking about the league tables as we were preparing them. You were very involved with the data. And so I'd like you to just start by telling us how bad was it? Yeah. Well, it was quite bad. We saw a clear decline in the project finance activity in all types of deals. I think it's very, very easy to understand it if we just compare two numbers. We passed from $11.5 billion of 2019's first quarter to $7.3 billion of these years. Wow. Yeah. It had a drop in every type of sectors. And the biggest drop was the refinancing activity year over year. And I think this is a very interesting data to look at because refinancing transactions were the main player, the boost of the 2019 activity during the whole year, with more than 100 transactions accounting for $22 billion. But this quarter, activity has not kept up the same pace, and only seven transactions reached their financial close. So this is a pretty big drop. But the lower decreases, if we just analyze the deal types, has been the greenfield activity, where 20 projects reached their financial close. Even if everything got to be a little analyzed, and if you look at these figures, we need to keep in mind that 13 out of those 20 projects were renewables. So if we look at the more traditional infrastructure, which is, let's say, roads or transportation, not greenfield roads projects reached their financial close in the entire region. And the only one in the transportation sector was the Salaverri port in Peru. Sure. It was very peculiar. It was very peculiar. And we published the report with several charts. I think the first bar chart with the graph showing the progression quarter over quarter of project financing, renewable refinancing activity and everything else, the drop is incredibly stark when you compare it against the other quarters. First quarters can be typically slow. Last year was slightly lower than the year before. And that one was lower than the first quarter in 2017. But we really recognized that there was a heavy drop here. Now, there are a few factors responsible for that. When we were looking at what was happening in the region, I think we were talking about certainly some of the social conflicts that were happening in places like Colombia and Chile, where they have massive demonstrations. We saw the oil prices obviously coming into play towards the end of the quarter, as anybody involved in the energy sector would have been concerned about what kind of pricing they would get on the resources and the commodities that they were trading. And also, we saw that Mexico was determined to continue its anti-private investment policies. They were arguing with renewable developers about the sales and the subsidies to renewable projects. And in the meantime, the only economy that really stuck out was Brazil, where they're heavily in favor of privatization of many, many state assets in the infrastructure sector. And they have an extensive program of greenfield investment projects as well. Were there any other trends that you recognized in the region? Yes, indeed. Actually, I just wanted to add that I completely agree with what you said about the factors that caused this slowdown. I think we also need to show that probably the fact that we see almost daily these rating agencies that are downgrading both sovereign ratings and SPD's ratings. And this doesn't make things easy, of course, for investors. They just increase the uncertainty towards the market. So I think this is a big factor as well. Talking about trends of this quarter, I think that if we look at the M&A's sector, for instance, the market this year has been driven by a couple of big financial closes, even if the number was of the entire transaction was lower. We saw Northland Power's acquisition of EPSA, which is the Empresa de Energía de Boyacá, which is a distribution company based in Colombia, and it was sold by Brooklyn Control Fund. It was a deal that was worth more than $700, and it was the top deal we registered in terms of economic size this quarter. Another very, very important deal was the sale of Empresa SICA's assets in Mexico to MIP, Mexican Infrastructure Partners. And this was another over $500 million deal. Talking about trends, I think it's interesting, as we pointed out before, that renewables deal were the bigger amount of deals among Greenfield transactions. And as you said, most of them were located in Brazil. Brazil, one of the biggest, probably actually the biggest economy of the region, as you said, presents many opportunities in all type of deals, but they also registered a drop in the infrastructure financial activity. One of the reasons, as our reporters pointed out, is that the development bank, the BNDES, has already seen its role and its help as main traditional lender to private investors. Yeah, that's something that people have been anticipating for a long time, but clearly it's a gradual transition away from BNDES and something that perhaps the commercial banks weren't ready to step up quite in time for this crisis. But certainly something that we'll analyze looking forward. Giulio, thanks very much for sharing your insight into some of these deals and some of these trends. Thank you for having me, Jonathan. Excellent. Well, we hope for the improvement of conditions moving into the second quarter. We continue to speak to our sources to produce timely reporting on transactions that are continuing and sadly those that are not. So, stay tuned and we'll continue to provide you with the best updates we can regarding project finance activity in Latin America.

I'm John Burke, your host and America's editor for Information News. Joining me today on the podcast is Kat Sudehi of HNTB and Benjamin Hall of John Lang. They're part of the Young Professionals of Infrastructure. Before we get into the program, Kat, I'd love to hear more about YPI. So why don't you go ahead and take it away. Thanks, John. So as John mentioned, my name is Kat Sudehi. I'm a vice president at HNTB and I do strategic advisory work with a focus on P3s and alternative delivery. So I'm one of the founders of the Young Professionals of Infrastructure, YPI, and I'm currently co-president along with Ali Lauzon who's at McKinsey. So I wanted to give you just a bit of background on YPI and then I'm going to transition things back over to John and Ben. So YPI is an industry organization that was established and is run by young professionals from industries across the infrastructure space. So we have about 35 organizational members from the public and private sectors. We've got developers, contractors, financial advisors, law firms, public agencies. So our membership really runs the gamut. So we founded the organization in 2015 to help with knowledge sharing and networking for junior and mid-level professionals, specifically in the public-private partnership and innovative delivery space. So while we started out with more of a social networking focus, in the past few years, we've really transitioned to having more of a focus on substantive programming and professional development. So we're really trying to ensure that we help build a pipeline of talent in the infrastructure space that has a dynamic knowledge base and skill set so we can help drive forward successful projects and programs for our clients and communities. So YPI has actually been collaborating with Infra Americas for about four years now. And our marquee networking event is usually centered around the Infra Americas P3 conference each summer in New York. So we've decided to expand our collaboration and working with John to partner for certain podcast episodes is one way that we're looking to do that now. So we're really excited about that and also about today's discussion. So just quickly before I transition things back over to John and Ben, I wanted to briefly address the context for today's discussion. So more and more in recent years, the landscape of P3s has begun to change and the type of deals that core players in our space have begun looking at has really diversified. And there are also a lot of new market participants that have entered onto the scene. So while initially a lot of us in YPI and the P3 space generally were focused primarily on transportation deals, because that's where the P3 market was largely, we're now seeing more varied types of projects coming to market. So both for me at HNTB and at YPI, we're starting to broaden the scope of what we're focusing on to really wrap in things like real estate and emerging technologies, which are becoming core elements of new projects that are coming to market. So we're looking at more projects that aren't just classic DBFOMs, but that have different structures, look a little bit different. So today we're going to be looking at a type of project that's somewhat unique and has been growing in popularity in recent years, distributed energy deals. So, John, I'll let you take it from here. Great. Thanks for that introduction, Kat. And just to remind everyone, if you haven't seen on our bulletin, of course, the US P3 conference, obviously it was moved to the fall from its June date this year for obvious reasons. We're going to be in October 5th and 6th, I believe. Anyway, so let's talk about this emerging trend. Where we've picked up coverage on this the most has been in the university space, although there's been some other deals. The big headliner was the University of Iowa doing an energy P3 project with Anji and Meridian, in which they're going to get a modern energy project in exchange for a $1 billion upfront payment, which is going to also turn into an endowment for the university. But there's been certainly other distributed energy projects around the university space, as well as some other areas. And Ben, I thought we'd just lead off with just getting a good idea of what's driving investment in the sector at this point, as distinct from utility-scale renewables. Yeah, thanks, John. I think you've touched on something there, an important point. I think the market's really seen the success of, I think, firstly, OSU back in 2017, which was also won by Anji, but with a different financial partner axiom on that deal. And then more recently, obviously, the Iowa deal, where both universities received upfront payments in excess of $1 billion. So it's a pretty eye-watering figure. So I think that's really demonstrated to the market that, with respect to the financial outcomes, at least, that the P3 model can be utilized really successfully to monetize effectively what are non-core assets in a university construct. From a CFO perspective, I think it makes a lot of sense, right? They're effectively borrowing off balance sheet from the private sector and using those funds to pursue strategic objectives of the university, whether that's, I don't know, expanding curriculum, offerings to students, research and development, or as you mentioned, funding university endowments. I think the last point is an interesting one. Based on discussions that we've had, I think some CFOs are looking at this as like an arbitrage opportunity, really, where effectively we're looking to borrow from the private sector at a high single-digit IRR and then looking at what they can earn on that money in their endowment funds, which could be low double digits to mid-double digits. So there's certainly potentially an arbitrage play there for certain institutions that have got good money managers, in effect. So that certainly comes into play, I think. I think there are a bunch of other reasons why there's been an increase in interest in this sector from universities. I think from a university perspective, they've got to be asking themselves the question whether or not they want to be in the business of running utility plants. It's obviously core to their mission to have that infrastructure in place to be able to deliver on their core mission. But from an operations perspective, I don't think they're – and they would probably acknowledge that they're not necessarily best placed to be doing that or ultimately want to be doing that. There's significant deferred maintenance on a lot of these systems as well, which require substantial immediate investment to continue providing reliable and efficient services to the campuses. And for the less well-heeled universities, they simply can't afford to do that. So again, the P3 model can be a useful tool to help that. Again, it comes back to some of the benefits of P3 as well, I think. Private sector know-how can be used to improve efficiency and reliability. Many universities also have decarbonization goals and are looking to the private sector to help with that. From a private sector standpoint, I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both industrial players as well as financial investors like Zhong Meng. I think from an investor perspective, these assets garner a hell of a lot of interest. You know, if you look at the Iowa deal, for example, there's been public information released about the financing structure for that, and there was a half a billion dollar equity check available there on that particular deal, which in the P3 world, it's hard to come across a half a billion dollar equity check. So significant investment opportunity is obviously highly attractive. You've got long-term concessions, 30 to 50 years, which again is very attractive for infrastructure investors that are looking for those long-term and relatively stable cash flow profiles. Generally, you've got well-structured concession agreements with appropriate risk transfer consistent with other P3 precedent in the market. Most of the institutions coming to market have strong credit ratings. I think on the public side, over 50% of public universities have an A-grade credit. I think it's less on the private side, but it's still pretty substantial. And you know what, they're relatively low-risk operations. So from an investment standpoint, it makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. I think we've noticed too that in league with both the university's goals too, we've noticed obviously state universities going in line with overall state renewable goals as well as part of this. Have you observed anything about the private versus public universities in terms of pursuing these projects, if it's a different process or if it's more difficult? Just curious if you've had any observations about that. Yeah, that's an interesting point. What I think is that the private sector may, it may be easier for the private sector universities to pursue these opportunities on a bilateral basis, right? So you saw a deal done last year between Clearway Energy and Duquesne University. And from what I understand there, that was an unsolicited proposal that was put together by Clearway and pitched to the university. And they were able to pursue that. It took some time to get the structuring right. But I think that private universities have greater capability to pursue those kind of bilateral type of deals versus public universities, which have, they need to follow procurement laws and have other regulations that they need to abide by for competitive bidding and the like. So certainly I think there's a greater propensity for industrial players and financial investors to be speaking with the private universities rather than the public universities to try and get an unsolicited bilateral kind of deal off the ground. Are there any interesting deals in the market right now or in development that you think are worth highlighting? Yeah, absolutely. I'm spending a lot of time at the moment following the market in this space. I think if you think about some of the immediate term opportunities, obviously the University of Idaho is currently in the market with a procurement. They issued an RFQ, I think it was late last year. And according to the press, it actually shortlisted a group of bidders. I think the scope for that, that project looks pretty typical in terms of what you'd expect to see for a utility system plant. So I think it's fairly all-encompassing with a combined heat and power plant, chilled water, water treatment and distribution systems. So where that project stands in terms of its timetable at the moment with COVID-19 in the mix is a little bit uncertain, but certainly that's out there and gotten a lot of interest from the market. The other one is Louisiana State, LSU. They're exploring a project which was slated to come out in Q2 this year with an RFQ. They actually received an unsolicited proposal as well. So they're kind of running those two processes at the same time. And I think we'll be looking to make a decision one way or the other before they launch an RFP process. I think that deal will look a little bit different to OSU and Iowa, for example. I think it's probably going to be more of an availability, greenfield-style P3 versus Iowa and OSU, which is more of a monetization. So we'll wait to see what comes there. And Maryland is also in a similar state of play there. They're looking to get final approvals for launching a procurement process, which was slated to occur in Q2 as well. But again, a little bit of uncertainty around how these processes play out in the short term, given the COVID-19 situation being so fluid. The other project probably worth mentioning that's been in the market for a while now is Dartmouth. But that project has faced some delays. I think there's some alumni as part of that university who have opposed the energy solution, which is combusting renewable fuels. They weren't too happy with, I guess, the overall carbon footprint of that solution. So the university, I think, are reconsidering what the right energy solution is there. But there's actually no timing update on when that's going to be relaunched. There are other deals that are a bit further out, which have been in the press. And then you guys have reported on Washington State and Wayne State. But I think those are a little bit further away in terms of when they're expected to come to market, if at all. Great. And getting on to COVID-19, you kind of made an interesting point about LSU, about availability payments. We're obviously facing a point where municipal bond spreads are starting to widen. So that could certainly play a role in how that project moves forward. But what's your views on how the crisis is affecting these deals, and also the attractiveness of other institutions pursuing the model at this point? Yeah, I think, much like everybody in this situation at the moment, I think nobody really knows what's around the corner. Yeah, we're living in crazy times, unprecedented times. So I think it's hard to say what's going to happen with these projects in the short to medium term. I think ultimately, there's enough of an impetus behind the rationale for the projects that they'll ultimately get done. I don't think that COVID-19 changes any of that. It's just a matter of timing, in terms of being able to commit the resources, have the people available, and also have the market available to formally launch the processes. I think clearly, universities at the moment are probably focusing on other things. They've got empty campuses at the moment. They're probably all focused trying to set up digital teaching platforms, or however they're managing that. But yeah, so my view is that the projects that have a strong basis for being implemented, they'll come to market eventually. It's just got to wait for the dust to settle on COVID-19. I think to address the second part of your question about whether or not COVID-19 attracts or affects the attractiveness of this sector to the private sector, I don't think that changes at all. The fundamentals of why we would want to be involved with this deal or these types of deals haven't changed. I think what will happen is people will be paying a lot more attention to the risk provisions in the concession agreements or the lease agreements with respect to force majeure and pandemics, and how they're treated in the lease agreements, because that's obviously a big focus for everybody right now. I know certainly at John Lang, we're dealing with COVID-19 live across our portfolio of assets in North America, and force majeure provisions are getting a lot of attention at the moment. And I'm sure that's the same for absolutely everybody in the infrastructure space right now who are managing a portfolio of assets. So I don't think the attractiveness of the sector changes. I just think people are probably paying more attention to certain risks. Great. Let's just move away from the university space for a second. You know, obviously, John Lang has a global footprint across greenfield energy development projects, as well as transport, as well as all over the greenfield development space as regards to infrastructure. Have you guys looked at distributed energy deals just to cities and states? Has that been something that's been something you guys have looked at before? Yeah, I mean, if you look at this space, it's not limited to universities. I think, obviously, the immediate opportunities have been coming in the university space. But, you know, combined heat and power plants, distributed energy, co-gen, whatever you want to call it, has applications far beyond just university campuses. You know, you've got healthcare facilities, military and government installations, airports, large industrial complexes. You may have seen that there's a deal on the market at the moment where Stone Peak is selling an industrial asset. So, I mean, there's lots of opportunities in the market to pursue these kind of distributed generation opportunities beyond university campuses. I think they're certainly harder to come by and aren't necessarily going to be as common as universities in terms of public procurement opportunities. You know, I think, you know, maybe on the airport side, you might see a couple come out. But, certainly, on the industrial side, you know, they're more kind of private deals done on a bilateral basis. But, certainly, we see opportunities there for sure. Great. Thanks for that. So, just to sum it up in terms of what all these trends mean for the workforce required to procure and deliver the projects, it'd be good to get insight, you know, just specifically around, say, how modeling and forecasting skills are necessary for a social infrastructure project, you know, relative to a transport P3, or here in this case, you know, an energy deal relative to a transport P3. It'd be good to get your views on that. Yeah. I mean, coming from a modeling background myself, I think – I didn't necessarily think the skill set is materially different between a transport deal, a social infrastructure deal, a renewable energy deal, or a campus utility plant deal. I don't think it really matters, right? I mean, if you've got – understand the fundamentals of financial modeling, then, you know, I think you're well-placed to be able to cover a lot of sectors as long as you, one, understand the deal properly, how it's structured, and, you know, you've got a sound base in, you know, financial modeling skills. I'm not necessarily sure that the skill set changes that much, to be perfectly honest. Excellent. Thanks for that. Well, it's been a really interesting journey you've taken us through these different types of projects, and really great to speak with you guys today. Looking forward to doing it again down the road. So, that's all the time we have. This has been John Burke for information. Thanks for tuning in.

Joining me 1st is D.J. Gribben, operating partner with Stone Peak Infrastructure Partners and formerly part of the Trump administration. Later in the show, Latin American news editor Jonathan Carmody will discuss Mexico's private energy market and the broader infrastructure market at large with Gonzalo Maldonado. Managing director to consultancy, GM EC. So, D.J., welcome to the show again. Really appreciate you taking the time. We could talk for hours, I think, at this point about what's going on in the world, but we'll try and compartmentalize as best we can here. So, first and foremost, quite recently, U.S. Senator John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called for enhanced legislation, the Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019, or SC2302, to be included in the $1 trillion federal stimulus package being pushed through by the Trump administration. What is the latest you've heard on these developments? That's a great question. Obviously, we're in a very unusual and very uncertain time with COVID-19 impacting virtually every American's life currently, and it's unclear how long this is going to last. Right now, most of the conversation when it comes to the COVID-19 response has not been touching infrastructure. It's really been focused on ensuring that individuals, workers, businesses have access to resources so that we don't have a significant depression when it comes to demand in our consumer-based economy that ripples out through it. So, while there have been conversations in infrastructure primarily around airports and airlines, obviously Amtrak has been in the news as well. When you think about P3s and investing in infrastructure overall, we haven't worked our way down the food chain far enough to get to that topic. It makes sense for Senator Barrasso, who's been a significant champion of highway reauthorization, a great champion for infrastructure, to put his hand up and say, hey, as long as the federal government is money, why don't we spend it on something that's as important as highway infrastructure? When you think about how the virus and the reaction to the virus affects infrastructure and P3s in particular, I think currently there's much more focus on ensuring that workers, that individuals, that businesses have access to capital. The focus right now is much more on urgent responses than on infrastructure as a whole. So, while it makes sense for Senator Barrasso to push for additional funding as part of highway reauthorization, which is an important priority, I think given a sense of urgency around other spending needs, it's unlikely that a stimulus package will include overall highway funding. It may include specific projects, specific opportunities, but unlikely that it would include the legislation as a whole. So, Fitch came out with some very measured guidance yesterday on how their thoughts were on COVID-19 as it affected various aspects of infrastructure. They sort of divided it into two segments, demand-based infrastructure and then contracted assets, meaning short-term impact through demand-based, which is airports and toll roads, and then contracted assets, which I think they're probably referring in some sense to midstream assets. As they talk about the deteriorating quality, the off-taker and how it affects the contracts, and you could think about PPAs too, I guess, maybe in that. But what were your thoughts on that guidance in particular? I haven't read the guidance at all, but the general concept of understanding that different infrastructure assets and their projected future performance will vary depending on the nature of the asset is absolutely right. In my home state of Virginia, we're seeing significant drops in the 40% to 60% range of utilization of some toll road assets. So, that's obviously very worrisome if that continues. I mean, if this is a V-shaped curve challenge that we're facing currently, then that's less concerning than if the economy dips and then usage is significantly down now and stays that way for a prolonged period. So, I don't think infrastructure assets, how they respond to this, I think that's hard to project at this point. I mean, I could argue both ways. One, the demand-based assets like toll roads are going to be quicker to respond than assets like midstream, which are going to be more reliant on the economy as a whole. Okay. So, it was interesting that you talk about Virginia toll roads. We do have one asset, the Elizabeth River Crossing toll road that Inquiry and Skanska had tentatively been looking to sell. Investment Bank had been hired in the form of RBC, and there had been a push to start the process in early 2020, but it seems like we've heard that that's been put on hold for the time being for obvious reasons, but that was one asset we were watching earlier this year. DJ, just switching gears to specifically the P3 projects, curious to get your thoughts on the process and how everything gets impacted by it. Yeah, I think that's a good question. So, you have the procurement on one hand, and you can move that forward and get teams shortlisted. You can get RFPs submitted. Then you have the economics of the deal, the actual financing that needs to get done either through a mini-perm construction facility, private placement bonds, some combination of both, and then you have the timeline, the necessity to get a project built. I have a certain sense, although we really haven't heard it yet, that L.A. is probably getting a little bit nervous at this point, given their timelines that they've laid out to get their city properly having some projects in place ahead of the Olympics and how this probably affects the timeline somewhat when we're talking about significant LRT projects, two big airport projects, et cetera, et cetera. But mind you, I'd like to just get your take on how you think all three elements might get affected by the virus today. That's a great question, John. So, there's obviously multiple different elements that you're talking about here, but the one thing that's hard to understand if you haven't been inside of government is what a crisis like this does to your command structure. Because essentially, the top part of any government institution at this point, they're spending 24-7 thinking about how to respond to this virus. So, any decisions that need to be made along an infrastructure nature that would be kind of day-to-day formal decision-making, that's all getting pushed back. On the good news side of this is crises like these encourage innovative thinking, and P3 is a phenomenal procurement tool. There's a fair amount of political resistance to any new innovative idea. I think the environment that we are in currently helps erode that resistance and encourage much more innovative thinking. In terms of the process itself, you put your finger on it. Anything that's in process right now should anticipate getting delayed until the leaders of state, county, city, federal governments get their arms around this crisis. The good news for Los Angeles, it is a particularly high-functioning government. So, if any government in the U.S. can walk and chew gum at the same time, it is Los Angeles. So, I wouldn't worry too much about them, but I would worry about the ability of governments to address the crisis, patch up immediate concerns, and then be able to get back to more business-as-usual type decision-making, like how do we develop this P3 project. So, you're going to see, I think it's good of you to split it out in several different ways, because this crisis will affect projects different ways, and it will also affect projects based upon the geography that you're working in. So, if you're a very high-functioning government and the geography you're in, less of an impact. States that maybe are doing P3s for the first time, or cities that are thinking about P3s for the first time, this now becomes quite hard for them to think about this while they're trying to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. Yeah, that's a very interesting commentary there. Appreciate that. And this kind of also had, you know, came in what had been anticipated to be what could be a busy year. I'm just phrasing it out here, TJ, but, you know, we had seen some promising projects, you know, introduced at the beginning of January, or late December, namely the Maryland Managed Lanes Project, and seemingly very highly motivated Georgia DOT to get SR-400 finally out there. You know, the type of thing where you see infrastructure funds partnering with contractors, and, you know, everybody, you know, Maryland has had its fair share of troubles, but you can better describe more than I, although I can describe it as well, about how congested the roads are that this project would solve. It's just a mess. It's horrible. Absolutely horrible. Yeah, I grew up in that neighborhood. On 270? Yeah, on 270. I grew up in Thurston, Maryland, so it's right where- Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah. I used to live in Chevy Chase, so yeah, we all saw it. Yeah, yeah. But these are projects where there's a lot of good, you know, common interests aligned with very motivated investors, and, you know, we'll see what transpires in the next few months. Obviously, the timeline establishes that people get, you know, plucked as proponents much later in the year. It's not something that was an immediate process right now. But those are two projects we were sort of eagerly watching how it unravels, comes out. And then some stuff that was in the more short-term or medium-term were the two Civic Center projects, like LA Civic and the National Western Center in Denver. And then Fargo-Moorhead, again, years in the making, finally a positive ruling. And USA's, you know, planning to move forward with some very well-heeled investors alongside contractors and I think a summer deadline for the RFPs, but I guess we'll see what happens there. Any other projects that have caught your eye? Not projects. Actually, I would take a step back, and I think there's a bit of a silver lining to this crisis. And that is on both the buy and the sell side. From the government perspective, as I mentioned before, we're likely to come out of this crisis with governments having fewer resources and needing to be more nimble and more creative than we went into it. And they were when we went into the crisis. And I think on the investor side, I think also, while there's not really a lack of investment currently, I think this underscores the fact that infrastructure as a stable asset makes sense as part of your portfolio. So I think hopefully what will happen is that the shock will encourage people to be a little bit more creative, especially government, to be a little bit more creative in terms of how they deliver their infrastructure and how they operate and maintain infrastructure over time. And that will create more opportunities for those invested in the P3 market. Excellent. Well said. Well, DJ, I thank you for coming on the program today, and we'll let you go. Thanks for taking the time today, sir. My pleasure. Take care, John. So after talking through the U.S. market, we're going to move south to Mexico, where I'll let our Latin American news editor, Jonathan Carmody, take it away with Gonzalo Monroy. Thanks for coming to the program, guys. Thanks very much, JB. Yeah, we're here today with Gonzalo Monroy from GMEC in Mexico. Particularly today, we want to have a look at the energy sector in Mexico and how the certain crises that we're experiencing at the moment are affecting business in the country. So Gonzalo, firstly, thanks for joining us today. Oh, thank you, guys. Gonzalo, I wonder if you could just give us a brief update on what the situation is like in Mexico. I'm sure JB's already mentioned the U.S. situation. Basically here, we've been working from home since mid last week. I understand from speaking to several sources in Mexico that the government has been reluctant to send people home and to shut things down. So if you could just give us a very brief introduction in what is the situation regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. And what is the government and what are industry doing about that? Well, yes, guys. Well, first of all, as you correctly mentioned, the government has been very hesitant to implement harsher measures or to reduce pretty much public transportation in Mexico in general. As probably you guys know, and the audience may know, one of the largest musical festivals in Mexico, the Viva Latino, which gathers around 60,000 to 70,000 people per day, actually was not canceled. And some of the first infected, unfortunately, infections have come from there. So it is very likely that in the following days, we may see a reaction, a quicker reaction from the government. That being said, a lot of the companies, especially in the energy sector, have started to take some measures, especially work from home, remote operations, a continuity of operations, have been implemented since last week. Pretty much all of the energy companies, especially from the private sector, not Pemex, not CFE, the largest choose-to-stay-at-home utilities in Mexico, have taken such measures. Pretty much as a color note, yesterday was the 82nd anniversary of expropriation day in Mexico, where the Mexican government pretty much nationalized all the old industry in 1938. President López Obrador and the CEO of Pemex, Octavio Romero López, attended the event, along with several other high-ranking officials. The gathering actually had more than 300 people in a closed space, so it was pretty much a reflection of how much politics is imposing its way, rather than the prevented measures. Right, I see. So it sounds like Mexico has been a little bit slow to react, especially when you compare it to other countries like Peru or Paraguay, which put very strict regulations down very quickly, to restrict people from traveling and eating out at restaurants and going to bars. So that's interesting to hear that Mexico has been a little bit more reluctant in that sense. One thing I was thinking about when I was talking to you earlier, was the idea that you might have to shut down companies and industry. I know Mexico is heavily reliant on the maquilas, the factories in the north. If this virus continues to spread, what kind of effect do you think it could have on workers in Mexico? Well, actually the impact has already started to be felt. As I said, the government has been very hesitant. You have to recall that Mexico had a little minor contraction, pretty much a stagnation, over 2019, which decreased by 0.1% negative. So in reality, the urgency for the government not to slow down the economy even further is very, very clear. And perhaps this will give way to a larger conversation in which the government is very, very focused on not to decrease the amount of fiscal revenues they are obtaining. The old crash that we have seen over these months, I would say, has been very catastrophic, especially for Pemex, but especially and more focused on the fiscal revenues for the federal government. Taking back to your question, that is the whole reason why the Mexican government has not implemented harsher measures. Even the president himself and a number of people and analysts have pointed this out. It's like trying to deny reality. It's pretty much a denial state in which he has not canceled any events, any large gatherings in his morning conference in Palacio Nacional. And he tends to be, I would say, a step back or trying to deny something that is very real, that has a serious economic impact, and in which Mexico has not taken the necessary provisions to face it in a more expedite and more responsible way. Sure. And we heard from Brazil that the president there, Bolsonaro, is taking a very similar approach, possibly for different reasons, but certainly much more in denial of the risks associated with the virus and certainly very slow to shut things down. That's very interesting. Well, it's happening at a very interesting time, Gonzalo, because we were expecting this week the government to introduce a new energy infrastructure plan. Would you be able to give us any insight into if that plan is still expected to be presented this week? And what you expect to see in the plan? Absolutely. Well, first of all, we have to remember that this infrastructure plan was about to be presented since December of last year. However, that internally fighting against some of the more conservative hardliners that are present in the heads of CFE, of the Ministry of Finance, well, I would say Ministry of Energy, sorry, are very reluctant to have more open opportunities or more opportunities for private investment. As such, they have been very focused on keeping a model in which the state-owned utilities, both CFE and Pemex, are having pretty much a central role, an essential role, and pretty much the only role of the energy sector in Mexico. On the other hand, you have a more moderate wing of the government, led by the Ministry of Finance, that was my mistake, which are trying to promote more private investment to pretty much pick up a growing path of the GDP and have a more dynamic economy. However, this insight, as I was saying, is pretty much not being solved, but rather managed by President López Obrador. That being the case, the whole idea, and this is something that he actually mentioned yesterday, is that the plan would be presented Friday or perhaps next week. That being the case, the whole presentation of this infrastructure plan has been postponed three times. So, another four, it wouldn't be a surprise at all. What to expect? And I think that this is perhaps a larger question. Originally, the plan has already been settled. It's going to be a lot of service contracts in terms of the oil and gas industry, pretty much all contracted by Pemex. In the electricity sector, it's pretty much all EPC contracts. No opportunities for private investment, no significant investment in transmission or distribution lines, and no modernization whatsoever of the electric grid. That is something that is quite interesting about that. In terms of other projects, in terms, for example, midstream, the only large project that is being focused is interconnection of the Mayacan Pipeline in the southern part of Mexico with the Cistrangas, which would be the integrated pipeline system, originally the national pipeline system. It is pretty much a 10-mile interconnection. Originally, it was going to be beat out internationally, but at the end of the day, it was a direct award from CFE to ENGIE, the operator of Mayacan. Other large projects are expected in downstream, especially in older refineries. Just as a side note, President López Obrador, in his nationalistic view of the energy sector, is promoting a lot of the Mexico pickup based on its refining system, which has been lagging currently and nationwide. It's at 42% utilization rate, quite below any international standards. In the way of thinking of this administration, imports are seen like a dependency and such as a loss of sovereignty. Given the nationalistic ways that I said before, this is pretty much unacceptable for the administration, which has focused more now in downstream instead of upstream with all resulting consequences. Interesting again. That sounds very bleak from what you've been saying in terms of the opportunities for the private sector. We have seen that the PIDI regas, the kind of design, build, finance plants that the government's proposing for certainly thermal generation plants could have some opportunities for certainly, as you said, EPC contracts with a short-term construction financing. But how do you see the prospects for those investors who are perhaps already in the Mexican market or who are interested in getting into the Mexican power market? Are there going to be any new spaces for those developers and those investors to acquire or to develop projects in the country? Or do you think it's going to take a radical shift on the thinking of the government for there to be new opportunities for those investors? I think, Jonathan, that this actually is going to be a crucial week for the government. Pretty much the whole approach for making PEMEX and CFE great again to regain their market power is being seriously challenged by now. For example, take a look at PEMEX. PEMEX had a loss of almost $35 billion in 2019. Production is not picking up. There is a serious, almost a certainty that PEMEX will lose its investment rate. So the whole strategy of strengthening PEMEX by reducing the participation of private investors has actually backfired, to be honest. I think that this week is going to be, especially with all the oil price crash, and also a decreasing, an enormous surmounting debt interest to be paid this year and the following. You have to remember that also the Mexican peso has devalued by almost 25% over the last two weeks. So everything is going to be challenged right now. Two days ago, President López Obrador had an emergency meeting with all his cabinet members, so they could review or to offer some solutions or ideas of what can be changed or done. It is my understanding that there could be potentially some opportunities in this new infrastructure plan, but it's not going to be game changers. There is no expectation that big rounds are going to be relaunched, electricity options to be restarted, but rather have a more opportunity to develop these kind of projects. We're not going to miss with existing projects, business as usual, but in terms of new opportunities, I think they're going to continue to be missed. Right, I see. It sounds like there's going to have to be a little bit more pain for the Mexican government before they realize that there is really a space there for the private sector to participate in the development of these projects. Do you have any other insight into how private projects are faring at this time? As you mentioned, obviously, the oil prices is very low. That shouldn't necessarily affect renewable or gas-fired plants, but in terms of the general sector, do you have the impression that certain M&A transactions or project financing deals might be slowed down because of the current crisis? Actually, what I have been seeing and hearing from a number of participants is that a lot of people are pretty much downsizing. They're pretty much no appetite for any, I would say, any risk, especially in Latin America in general. So I would tend to think that it's going to be wait and see to see how things settle after all this dust, all this mess, all this chaos. That being the case, a number of projects that should be expected to go online, especially in electricity, will continue to do so, perhaps at a slower rate, but it will definitely continue. But I think that the largest effect is going to be felt in upstream. You have to remember that, for example, Shell and Equinor, also BP, in partnership with Equinor, we're scheduled to have this aggressive drilling campaign in the Mexican shallow and deep waters. It is very likely that, given the oil price that we're seeing right now, those plans could be delayed, not entirely canceled, but perhaps delayed for some months at least until everything settles. You have to remember that pretty much all the energy sector and companies in general all over the world have taken a beat so serious that there is pretty much no money left for any development and or acquisition. So perhaps there are going to be some opportunities, but I don't think that the appetite is just. Well, Gonzalo, thank you very much for providing us with your insight on this industry at this time. We hope that the next time you go on the podcast, we can have a slightly more optimistic outlook, but this is a great view of the situation as it stands at the moment. Well, that's all the time we have. Thanks for tuning in. And like JC said, we hope the next time we go on air we'll have slightly more positive news. But thanks for hanging in there, guys, and stay safe. Berk out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-02-21 20:32:51+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Jefferies talks renewable investing\n**Episode ID:** 4448\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the February edition of information's crossroads podcast. I'm John Burke America's editor and During the program today is George Habash senior vice president of power utilities and infrastructure at Jeffries and Sparks but editor at Jinju Lee. Welcome to the program today guys. Yeah. Thanks for having me So today we are discussing a few topics that will surely be explored further in the IWF America's conference slated for next Thursday February 27th at convene in Midtown, Manhattan George will also be on a panel that day to discuss sustainable energy at 11 a.m alongside Robert Golding of Mayor Brown Stuart Murray of AFRI Hanno Shocklich of Kaiser wetter energy asset management John Breckinridge of capital dynamics and Mario Maselli of Upper Bay So before we get there George, it's obviously been a very interesting year in the solar and wind space And that's what we're here to talk about today We obviously had a very big deal hit in the fourth quarter when CPP IB Announced terms to acquire pattern energy and it take private so With the cost of wind and solar having come down substantially Versus only a few years ago And in some markets now competing directly with conventional generation. Where do you see? Sort of the investment pieces from fund infrastructure funds pension funds and other fund managers Having the most interest at this point. Yeah, I mean you've highlighted a pretty interesting transaction in this space the CPP IB acquisition of pattern I think that's a perfect example of Global pension funds and LP is really looking to deploy capital in renewables Driven by you know, ESG pressures and other sort of climate change Initiatives that they're pursuing and sort of being asked to pursue We're seeing the liquidity in the market for renewables generally still very strong What's perhaps been the most interesting sort of trend that we've seen in the last like 24 months is the bifurcation of? The types of capital pursuing renewables really across two main two main categories One type of capital chasing after, you know lower risk lower return Operating projects and really when I talk about operating projects is sort of like NTP and beyond And you know same same reasons people are being asked At fund managers and the LPs are requesting capital deployment opportunities in renewables and that's not just in the u.s It's really a trend we're seeing globally And then the what I think is probably the most innovative Capital that we've seen the last 24 months is that chasing renewables, but with a lot more sort of risk return You know sort of as part of the investment mandate And that's really being driven by some of the GPs that have raised dedicated capital to pursue more Platform oriented investments more greenfield exposure and more merchant exposure So there's been a tremendous amount of capital that's been raised across both of those categories. I'd say a lot of the traditional infrastructure funds that were pursuing You know low risk low lower return at the time which were still double digit returns Have now sort of migrated up the risk curve Insourced a lot of functions that would have otherwise been outsourced before like development capabilities like Origination capabilities for PPAs because they want to take a much more of a hands-on approach to finding opportunities deploying capital in those opportunities And really trying to compete with strategics, which you know they had a difficulty doing before so No, I'd say there's a there's a lot of vehicles that have been raised that are essentially pursuing you know platform and Greenfield-oriented Opportunities today than there was 24 months ago interesting we have seen Renewable funds being raised that's sort of the alternative bucket now. You know with these GPS. It's it's renewables and Debt essentially are the two alternative buckets. Are you seeing these renewable funds? Dedicated towards Greenfield or is that something that is renewable the renewable funds more to do them with the mature assets No, I mean, I think what they're doing is they're saying we're gonna take a pretty you know Flexible approach to how we deploy our capital and try to find Opportunities that provide us with superior, you know risk return propositions So when you think of like the the traditional GPL P model They're compensated based on how much capital they've raised. So they they you know get paid a fee for managing the capital that they've raised but also Have a certain return requirement that they have to deliver back to the LPS and most of these GPS and there are some exceptions and I'll talk about it in a sec But most of these GPS need to or are targeting sort of mid to low Sorry, excuse me low teens to mid teens returns so the only way to do that in renewables today in the US is to actually take on development exposure or more merchant exposure or By a platform that can deliver those types of returns. So you know the the investment principles at those funds are being compensated to find opportunities to deploy that capital and As I was saying before, you know, we're taking a hands-on approach to managing the risks and sometimes We'll even bring in internal expertise The referred as operating partners to help manage those risks. So that's you know, pretty That's a term we've seen in the last like 24 months Lots of capital, like I said that's being raised the the more sort of lower risk lower return capital Opportunities are still being looked at by those funds that I was just talking about and I think those will be Opportunities that will be used to round out funds once they've deployed, you know Certain amount of capital in perhaps higher risk higher return opportunities to sort of manage It's really part of portfolio construction frankly to manage the portfolio exposure. But One trend we're noticing is that some of the vehicles that have been successful in deploying Capital and renewables in those operating type of opportunities Have sort of raised capital and moved away from the traditional sort of, you know GP LP asset asset management compensation structure and are now just being paid based on nav so That allows them to essentially be a bit more competitive when they're deploying capital as compared to the other funds and By having a lot of those, you know internalized resources can save a lot of money on diligence costs and third-party costs Which then shaves further sort of their gross to net return proposition to tell these interesting I had one question that came up as a result of this discussion you know, obviously it's always talked about the PPA is reaching the end of their natural life and you know, the Lead being the generator the developer to Replace the PPA or go to merchant risk. Yep. How is this playing into how? The fund managers view these investments. Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question because I'd say 12 to 18 months ago We were seeing I mean I guess a broader trend that we've observed is that the return environment for renewables has come down dramatically I mean everyone everyone has seen that As the market has matured and and people have become comfortable with you know, the sub asset class generally And when you think of all the value levers that you can pull in a renewables type of transaction, there aren't that many? I mean, it's cost of capital and it's O&M Asset management and you know long-term power pricing views and you know, if you look at what the curve vendors are providing a Year or 18 months ago. I mean there were some pretty Aggressive back-ended power pricing assumptions that were essentially driving a lot of the sort of valuations that we saw in the market Even up until like I said, like, you know nine to twelve months ago, I'd say having received These recent vendors curves having been on the sell side and a couple of processes of late the market is really the market has really sort of Rationalized their views on long-term power pricing assumptions. I mean to for example to assume that in 2030 we're gonna see $75 power and ERCOT I mean obviously is difficult for someone to underwrite today, but they were willing to do so a year ago, right? So I think the market has become a bit more Realistic on what those power prices are gonna be and that's really sort of Rationalized a little bit the market environment now There are still people that have perhaps less experience in the u.s That are coming from overseas That don't have as much visibility on what the underlying fundamentals are gonna be and are relying on these third-party curve providers to underwrite You know their investment thesis for projects And they're just taking a view I mean, for example, you know Some folks are willing to take a view that there's gonna be a long-term carbon pricing in the u.s and they're gonna you know, maybe not take that at face value, but make it make a Decision that and take the view that it's gonna be a slight discount to what that curve looks like And there are the ones essentially that are clearing the market today But I think you know, I've been saying this for 18 months and I'm kind of happy that it's finally happening There has been a bottoming out of returns generally For operating renewables and in fact, you know That's the funds that were buying renewables a little while ago are the ones that are now saying well Actually, we're gonna go and do you know Greenfield because there's just a better value equation for our LPS So let's talk about the financing market For renewables doctor the financing market that would last several hours. We have 20 minutes Obviously, it's a strong you're coming against a strong market in general, you know for everything With terminal and bees that we see and that the private placements that get priced very handsomely in the market today What are your observations, you know, just taking a look back in the look forward for renewable energy deals Yeah, again, the market is very liquid and very aggressive when it comes to financing You know, the bank market has been very robust the pricing coming out of out of the banks has been very aggressive as well covenant light But you know, frankly, we think that the private placement market has been even more constructive on structure and pricing for those that are looking You know at a hold strategy versus than a as compared to a build and flip short-term strategy You know what we like about the private placement market for renewables, particularly if you have You know like a medium or longer term PPA Is the ability to lock in a structure lock in a rate and you don't really have to worry about it And they can be very creative and you know again 24 months ago probably less willing to You know Structure a transaction with private placement financing that had merchant exposure today, you know, we're involved in a couple situations where You know, the the private placement market is willing to take on some merchant exposure With some structuring on the back end, of course, but you know, they're essentially, you know willing to Have a tenor that extends beyond the contract life on the facility that's being put in place So we think that's you know now they're not underwriting Crazy back-end power pricing assumptions either but you know, it provides the sponsors with additional Debt capacity on the back end, which we think is appealing particularly if you're doing a refinancing and you want to extract value from the asset How much longer are those contracts? Beyond the the PPA. Yeah, the credit facilities that you know, we're in the market now structuring, you know Three to five years again It really depends on the situation and how long the the PPA the original PPA or the hedges who the sponsor is I mean, there's a lot of factors that Come into play, but generally speaking, you know, three to five years again with a lot of different types of structuring and protections around it You know, we're able to extend the amortization through that period. So you know, like I said, it's helpful for sponsors that are you know thinking about refinancing after COD or don't have any leverage at all and are looking to take out a dividend through a refi And the pricing has been again very strong You know, we're seeing some some 160 basis points for credit spreads Let's talk about the private credit market for a second Obviously, there's been some funds that you know last year sort of announced themselves to the world a little bit namely Capital Dynamics in Carlisle, I think with with debt platforms and I squared is coming this year. Yep. That's not to say they're focused on energy power renewables But you might think that's probably an area that they'll play a lot of their investment thesis in What have you observed about the private credit market so far in just sort of your market like where they've shown up where they've been? Competitor for some of these mandates. Yeah, look, I think so We think that Having these dedicated funds raise dedicated credit funds is actually a good thing for the market provides for the liquidity helps maintain, you know a robust competitive environment for for sponsors looking to raise capital what I think is perhaps interesting from a structuring standpoint with those funds and there are others that are Coming out in the market raising these dedicated vehicles. Is that there's a natural synergy that can sort of Be brought to bear as a fund manager between having access to equity which sometimes has a mandate a bit more restricted in terms of how they can structure that capital in the capital structure of a potential opportunity or a developer And you know the the credit opportunities that are naturally going to come to them from folks looking to essentially, you know finance projects and and hold codes on My point about structuring what we've seen in the market is that some of these funds are being very creative around structuring So having access to both both a pocket of equity in a pocket of of debt And I'll sort of debt quote-unquote because it could be structured many different ways Allows these fund managers to find solutions that make sense for developers that are perhaps less dilutive than if they were coming in as equity so we've seen you know structures where These fund managers are placing preferred or mezzanine type of capital inside of a developer or holding like a hold code vehicle So that the developer can actually use proceeds of that capital to go and do you know? All the things that they want to do now, sometimes it'll be secured against projects or secured against development opportunities, etc But it really allows a developer to not be diluted You'd say it's more hold code structures, right? It's gonna be subordinated versus senior. Yeah, that's right Although I mean, this is like hold co With you know security against projects. So as projects are being sold, you know, the lender Will have access to a preferred return or a first sweep on the capital Or you know I think some of the developers are always wary of of raising third-party capital to fund SG&A because it's highly dilutive It's very expensive so they can provide solutions to those to those issues And you know, obviously they have to compete with other Lenders in the market so their pricing is in line with what we're seeing elsewhere. So let's talk about storage which Will come up next week and has come up a lot lately Where are these Fund managers and sponsors coming on in terms of looking at as an investment opportunity and before you go into the answer I mean I can certainly cite two years ago where We had an executive from ICE speak at our conference about battery storage now It was such like a nascent cool trend. Yeah, has it become more institutional at this point is attracting more Dollars, you know from your vantage point. Well, I think when you think of the way that renewables evolved right first people were worried about the technology and then he became comfortable with the technology and then they were Sort of wary about the investment proposition and then it became comfortable with the investment proposition and we saw you know A combination of factors really drive down costs for renewables the same sort of phenomenon that's happening with storage It was fairly nascent five years ago. People were worried about the technology the sustainability of you know, the charging of the battery that the O&M profile etc, and that's obviously Those things have become more well understood and well known but you know, then there's the question over what the actual value proposition is and what's the investment thesis and I think investors are struggling with the investment thesis of standalone storage It's difficult to get visibility on the revenue stream. The contracts tend to be you know, a lot shorter in tenor Particularly, you know something we're seeing in California And so it's it it leaves The storage opportunity to those that have either one, you know Procurements to deploy storage like we've seen the utilities procure for in California But also those that have you know Real corporates that have really good visibility on what's happening on the grid and have an ability to really pinpoint Where storage makes sense on the grid and what the application of that storage is going to be? So it's difficult for the funds I mean we get inbounds from you know the folks that we work with all the time about storage opportunities that are being marketed and Marketed and they just struggle to figure out how they're gonna get their capital out what the return is gonna look like And what the long-term viability of that revenue profile at the particular sort of use case that is, you know being contemplated Now that's on the standalone storage side I think behind the meter applications are very attractive because then you have a captive customer And I'm talking about the CNI customer base that behind the meter storage facility would have There's really good visibility on especially if it's like a you know, blue chip name The visibility on what the value proposition is to the customer and it's more of a customer relationship question with that storage deployment and what you can do with a customer than it is putting You know a standalone battery Facility on the grid at a node where you think there's a good arbitrage opportunity. For example, so I'd say Lots of people are talking about it It's difficult to figure out Right now what you know the investment thesis looks like but I suspect you know Folks will figure this out as the market continues to evolve and mature over the next 24 months and we will see you know some Sponsor make an invest a pretty significant investment in the storage space Well George that's all the time we have for today, thanks for coming on the program really appreciate it We will see you next week. And for our listeners, please tune in for another podcast upcoming Berk out

I'm John Burke, America's editor for Information News. Joining me today is Information Zone Australian reporter Sean Drummond, who's been in the United States for about a month at this point over the holidays and into January to enjoy our cold weather. Sean, welcome to the program. Thank you. Thank you. He's here to share his insights on the Australian PPP market before he returns back home, which is later today. So we're blessed we're able to fit him in. Yeah, just call me. Later in the program, research analyst Melissa Gutschuh and I will preview the U.S. market. Thanks for joining us today, Melissa. And finally, Sparkspot analyst Molly Higgins will discuss a rising financing trend amongst solar deals. Thanks for joining us today, Molly. So Sean, first off, what can you say about the USA in the past four weeks? It's very big, very overwhelming, very exciting. Grand in the true sense of the word. I went to the West Coast, did a bit of a driving trip there, saw the sights, came over here, bit of a driving trip over this side as well. And New York is, yeah, is incredible. I think I'm looking forward to going back home for a little bit of quiet, though. Fair enough. Well, this program is not geared about comparing the Metro in Sydney versus the New York City transit system, but... Which is very, is a bit rickety, but works really well. That's good to hear. But we are here to talk about the PPP market. You know, every year when we have the USP3 conference in June, Australia comes up likely in every other panel about, well, if things were like they were done in Australia, we'd have a perfect USPPP market with such concepts as asset recycling being a very important driver of this. And I think a lot of the consultants we speak to want to introduce to these municipalities that they should be doing this. But why don't you just give us a little insight about how PPPs work in Australia and how asset recycling became a concept? Yeah, sure. Look, PPPs have been around for, gosh, I think one of the first ones was about 91. I think it was a road in Sydney. I think we kind of copied the UK. I think they were first. And we've done them in all sorts of different places, and they're getting pretty big these days. I would say they come and go, though. It depends on the politics, as it does here. Certainly, the last year or so, I've had a lot of whinging from bankers and the like, saying there's just not enough of them. They're very big, and I think that's part of the issue. They've got so big, they just take that long to get to an end. There's not enough smaller deals in between to keep the market kicking along. So this is light rail projects, in other words, versus smaller social projects. Social infrastructure. The social infrastructure deals have sort of gone away, various reasons for that. But I mean, looking at some of the stats from our own stats, I mean, over the last five years, P3 is the rich financial close. Look on Australia, it was 27. US, 40. Canada, more than 100. So Australia is somewhere in between, I guess, in terms of their enthusiasm for them. I guess the US should be a lot higher than that, given the size of the market. Well, I think, too, the explanation in Canada, and Melissa can opine on this, too, is that they find ways to put in smaller projects, truly, between the bigger ones. Yeah, you were mentioning social infrastructure project. That's really big in Canada, and so you'll see a lot of smaller deals. Although, I want to say that last year we've had a lot of transportation deals in Canada, and quite a big capex in total. If you look at the deals that reached financial close last year, there were 11 for almost $7 billion. There were two less the year before in 2018. Sorry, there were two more in 2018, so $13 billion, but it was only for $5 billion. So even though there's a lot of smaller social infrastructure projects, the deal size has been quite big with that. Yeah, Melissa's obviously referring to the Ontario and Ottawa extensions that took place over 19 and 18. One of the reasons, I guess, look, we had some ones in the 2000s that a load of road PPPs went bust, and so there was a real kind of hiatus after that, plus the financial crisis. There's a lot of debt in PPPs, but I suppose one thing that's kind of kept them consistently as just a common part of the landscape, we have a national PPP policy, all the states and territories, the federal government agreed to, which was drawn up by an organisation called Infrastructure Australia, which is an independent strategy body, and that was agreed to 2008. So basically it means any project over $50 million Australian dollars, each state and territory has to consider it for a PPP, at least. They may not choose to do it, but it's just part of the kind of make-up. Is it bilateral in the sense that Infrastructure Australia will also suggest things, or is it more... Look, Infrastructure Australia, they will. They'll do sort of, they regularly do kind of, I'm just trying to think what the name is now, but they, policy suggestions, like this is what we think you should do. We think, they've said in the past, we think you should privatise all the water infrastructure. The government said, no, thank you very much. Politics just won't allow that, but, so they are truly an independent organisation, even though they're still government, and they've said, I think they've said, you know, consistently, you know, it is a, I mean, the thing is, it is quite a well-accepted way of procuring Infrastructure Australia, so it's almost like they don't need to say anything much now. The government's just, it's there. It comes and goes, depending on, so some states, so at the moment, New South Wales, Victoria, the biggest states, they would definitely do the most of them, but that's particularly, that's where, because most of the population is, that's where most of the growth is, so they've got to build a lot more new infrastructure. Other states, Western Australia's done them a lot in the past, and experimented, you know, quite a bit with different styles. At the moment, none, because this government just is not interested in them. It's just, it's a, it's a Labor government. Generally, the Labor governments, you know, the left-leaning governments tend not to use them as much, and the Liberal government, which is the conservative government in Australia, probably uses them a bit more, but it, it's not that cut and dry, like there's a Labor government in Victoria, they use, they're probably doing more of them at the moment, you know, than others. Well, let's, let's, let's address asset recycling. Yeah, so asset recycling is a big part of that, as you said, is part of the, because essentially, I mean, you would, you would know this well from all the conferences talking about it, but, so when this particular federal government came in in 2013, they came out with a proposal that they would give 15% of the proceeds of any sale of public infrastructure to the state, as long as they used that money to build new infrastructure. Now, that really was only taken up mainly by New South Wales, like Victoria has, did a bit as well, but they had already privatised a lot of stuff in the 90s, so they had less to sell. Queensland, they had big plans, but they went too far and too fast, so they were going to sell everything off. But they got kicked out after one term because of it. So, but, and they were going to sack a lot of public servants and so on. So that killed it in Queensland, basically, because, so that really only New South Wales. And so they, basically, they sold three electricity distribution networks. They, the land titles office, and a bunch of other things. And then Well, just to get to the mechanics of it, though, I did want to get around to it. Is there some, within the states over there, is there certain guidelines about where the money goes towards? Is that why it's pointed like they go directly to social and education programs? It's not that specific. The state, it's up to the state. Basically, it's simply, you get, you have to build new infrastructure with this money that you get from the sale. Okay. Yeah. And the state decides where it goes, basically. But it's not like defined, like there's no, okay. No, not in this particular, I mean, in some instances, the feds, when they give money, will say, no, we want to go into this. But generally, the states get to decide what they're going to do with the money. So Well, just to give you the two pointed examples that we have, one is a little bit to be determined, I guess. But the deal that closed recently was the Iowa University P3, where it involved Angie and Meridian doing, you know, an O&M and renovation of existing energy systems. But they, it included an upfront payment of a billion dollars to the university. They just stripped away some fees, but just a shade under a billion gets established as an endowment. Yep. Which I thought considered, like, extraordinary. Like, honestly, it is a state school, and they do have a lot of subsidies. But the fact that there's now just an under a billion dollars endowment established for letting somebody like make your old energy systems like energy, you know, sustainable. And, you know, that's an interesting concept. The other one a little bit less clear is Indiana Tow Road. Yeah. Also a storied name, unfortunately, for good, bad and ugly. They agreed to a deal where the commercial trucking rates would go up in exchange for doing that. The concessionaire had to, which is now IFM, had to make a billion dollar payment to the state of Indiana. Now, we have to follow up to figure out, like, where that billion's going towards. Yeah. But I think they still need to close on some financings. But, yeah, there have been some cases recently. It's just kind of, you know, it's been weird. It hasn't been as publicized as much as I thought it would. Either project, that notion. I mean, the project was reported on who won and how it was going to work, but they didn't sort of, like, spell it out. Where's it going? This is acid recycling. And I will at least spell out where is it going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very different here. It seems to follow from what I'm getting from, you know, investors here. It's very much, they talk about a private to private market here. And it's like the private sector projects where it's much more a government market, I guess, in Australia. And so you will see where the money goes because it's the government and they have to say what they're doing with it. And that's part of selling it, though, the acid recycling and saying, OK, we're selling this, which is controversial anywhere in the world, privatizing anything. And it remains so. But you're going to get this as a result. So and, you know, so as a consequence, they're building a lot of transport projects. That's where it's going, just because that's where the need is. The growth. Australia is one of the faster growing developed countries, I guess. So the population is just going up. So that means they need a lot of transport, they need roads. And so that means it is going into very big projects. So that's where, you know, you mentioned Sydney Metro. There's multiple new metro projects being built. There's a new airport being built. You know, not all of those will be PPPs. You know, some of them, the government's just choosing to do it themselves because they've got enough expertise now internally. But there's a lot of tunneling. That's usually the most complex. And usually that sort of lends itself to a PPP. You've got things like North East Link in Melbourne, which is a motorway. That's being done as an availability PPP, which rather than, you know, where you're taking traffic risk, which is a problem, like no one still wants to take traffic risk in Australia. It's probably because of all these tunnels basically. In the US, I don't think they've quite recovered at all from that. Like there's just a very sincere lack of... Same. Yeah. The other reason for it is to use that kind of model is to ensure competition with Transurban because Transurban dominates the market. Now, if they just did like WestConnex, which is another big road in Sydney, they sold half of it. I mean, people tried to compete with Transurban. They just couldn't in the end. Basically, they just had all the firepower. Basically, Transurban wants a... They want to take traffic risk because they have all the data on all the traffic. And there's a few others that do have that ability, but not quite there. So, you know, there's a few models like that that they're looking at. But that's the issue we're going to get to finally is why we've got so... We've got now not that many, just very big. So North East Link is $16 billion. You know, the next Sydney Metro is at least $20 billion on its own. And there's another one that's $15 billion, you know, just massive elephants that, you know, take a long time to get there. And in the meantime, there's not much filling the gaps. Got it. All right. Well, we're going to circle back to you in a little bit to talk about some of what you've learned here. But let's shift gears over to the US and Canadian market where, again, we saw two proponents picked yesterday in Canada and the Halton Consolidated Regional Courthouse, get it going to a Fengate Group and the Nova Scotia 20 project being awarded to the BBGI and the construction company that I'm forgetting now. I guess a good start for the US and Canadian market that we got somebody in January. Malisse, why don't you take us through just what happened in 19 and maybe what's to come in 2020 for some of these bigger projects. We have a bunch of social projects that look like they have a good chance of making it. There is a managed lane controversial project in Maryland, which we'll be following all this year. If it reaches financial close by the end of this year, then I will be very pleased. And I think everybody will be pleased by that as well. But with that note, I'll let you talk, Malisse. Go ahead. Thanks, JB. So looking at 2019 and the P3 industry, Canada has always been the most active, but it seemed kind of a bit of a hiatus in their procurements with the provincial government that had changed and we've missed a year of pipeline. But that said, they've still managed to close 11 projects for what I said previously, 7 billion. So that's still quite a lot. The US closed only eight projects, which is two less than last year, but for a very small CapEx, so only 1.7 billion deal value compared to over 5 billion last year. So there's clearly been a bit of a slowdown in the P3 industry. But that said, I think when we look at the pipeline for 2020, there clearly is a lot of hope. And as you said, Canada closed two deals yesterday, and I think there's much more to come. They actually released their update of the, I mean, Infrastructure Ontario, the most active procurement agency in Canada, just released their updated pipeline. You'd say for North America too at that point. Yeah, I guess for North America, yes. When you look at who is most active, it's Canada, who's most active in Canada, Ontario. They just released their pipeline, and it seems like they've got quite a few deals that will be moving forward this year. We have a few that are expected to reach financial close in 2014. So I'm just putting out some names there, not just Canada, but also in the US. There's a Credit River Bridge in Canada. They shortlisted three teams this year. So with Hewitt and Dufferin, Elliston and Ferrovial. So we'll see that reaching financial close hopefully in September 2020. So busy fourth quarter. The, I mean, Halton Courthouse, you've mentioned. We also have the Petula Bridge, which is Acon and Acciona, who've been selected on this due to reach financial close. We have a few other projects that I'm expecting could reach financial close or at least get to preferred proponents in the fourth quarter. So that would be the LA Civic Center. They have shortlisted three teams as well, just at the end of the year. We have Clark Construction with Edgemore, Engie and Meridiem. We have Johnson Controls with Plenary, and the third team is with Hansel Phelps, Macquarie and JLC Infra. So quite a big pipeline for already, given that we're only at the end of January, 31st of January, most precisely. Infrastructure Ontario also announced a few procurements to be launched this year. So even if it's not going to be closing in 2020, I think it gives a bit more hope for 2021 and that the pipeline has been revived. So Ontario Line, which is huge project, will be launching in spring 2020. So I'm sure a lot of people listening to us today are looking into this project and waiting for the RFQ. There's some more social projects, as you mentioned, Kingston General Hospital, also in spring 2020. We have the Grandview Children's Treatment Center. The one in Montreal too is this year, isn't it? Something French. Something French. I should know. Yes, that's this year as well. There's another health redevelopment, the Lakeview one, Trillium Health, broader redevelopment as well. So a bunch of social projects coming up this year. I guess Iowa didn't factor into 2019's numbers. Obviously, they haven't reached financial close yet. They haven't reached financial close and that will be in March 2020. So that's also going to add up a few numbers too. And Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade. That will also factor into 2020 as it's closing. So I think the numbers are hopefully going to be up this year and there's a lot of projects coming up. Yeah. And obviously the Maryland project you mentioned. I think we hopefully will get an RFQ this year. I doubt it will be financial close, but... Yeah. That is sort of the revival of the MAST project is the Maryland Managed Toll Lanes project, but it's been just controversial all throughout. We had very pro P3 DOT head in Maryland by the name of Pete Rahn, who was championing like a three-phase project Yeah. Over $11 billion to add the toll lanes through Maryland and Virginia. Yeah. But it was much needed too for a former DC resident who sat in traffic on this road in the past and well aware some efficiencies would be well appreciated there. But obviously you're cutting through people's homes. You're doing construction and making lots of noise. And when you do that, you're going to arouse people's suspicions. You're also charging more money, of course, to go faster. Don't worry. You get a lot of that incident at the moment. It's basically a construction site. So they basically drastically cut the scope. They sort of said those phases, but like, okay, this phase one is going to be like this. It's going to be a bridge getting modernized and then spurs going in and out. And they're like, let's start there, you know, and see what we can do. And that's the process we're talking about. It's going to happen in 2020. Or go, sorry, start in 2020. The other one, there's been, again, the social thing has been a trend here. And another one that's taken off as part of that is sort of these mixed use developments falling into category where there's a lot and category where there's one. The category we've covered a lot lately has been the transit oriented development where the cities have said, okay, it's kind of a real estate thing, but we own this bus station, but we own this train station. We want to modernize it. We want to build around it. But the real estate kind of commercial real estate element pay for all this. Yep. Now that's happening. Yeah. Trying to do that in Australia. Interesting. Yeah. And then the most ambitious, I think of them all is there's this, we have a stadium project in the US. Stadium. Yeah. Which I know has been done in Australia. I know it's been done in. A little bit. Yeah. EMEA has gotten a few done too as well. Yeah. But they want to, this isn't building a new stadium. It's a renovating one. It's called the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii. Yeah. They got sick of just having a stadium that was half empty hosting football games. So they want to downsize it from 50,000 to 35,000, making more of a mixed use venue. But the other thing is it's all connected. It's in the same vicinity as a new station for the Honolulu Rail, or HART, which is also something we've been covering, which is this massive light rail that they're building. So in between the light rail and this reduced stadium is a hundred acres. I'm like, oh, we're going to redevelop that land into something spectacular. Yeah. So that's something that is going to take place throughout 2020 as well. The RFQ is coming out, I think, this quarter or the next quarter, which is going to be kind of interesting process to monitor. No, in the US, you don't really need P3s for stadiums when you have billionaires who run. No, I guess not. We don't do a heck of a lot. I mean, yeah. Didn't you get a rugby stadium built down there once? I know I've looked at you guys before. Yeah. There has been. I'm not sure. I haven't seen in my time any that's sort of been done as a P3 or anything like that. But I mean, the other thing is that they are building them, but with the asset recycling, they've got all this money. So it's more like just high school. So that's part of, I think, where maybe, where you haven't seen so many of the smaller social ones, they've got all this money now. They can just spend it and build it. Got it. They've got virtually no debt. In fact, they're in negative debt in New South Wales as a result of the asset recycling. That's changed again now because of other economic factors. But yeah, they've got the cash. Interesting. Yeah. Well, we'll shift to renewables for a little bit. Molly, you put out a story recently about solar equipment supply loans, or we called them ESLs, I believe. Yes, yeah. And I guess it was sort of in direct response to the federal solar tax credit getting not extended, wind got extended, solar didn't. Right. And absent the tax credit, there was a funding gap. And I think this is where ESLs come into view. So why don't you tell us about this a little bit? The solar investment tax credit, the ITC, it dropped down as soon as 2020 began to 26% from 30%. So this solar equipment supply loan, the ESL, it's a novel type of transaction in the solar space. It means that when a developer acquires solar equipment, such as panels or inverters, and as long as the equipment will be used in projects operating by 2023 and the deal closed by the end of 2019, they'll receive the full 30% ITC and avoid the drop down to 26%. This type of loan was seen in the wind industry when they were approaching their drop down as well. But yeah, so in the solar space for North America, we've had a very active year, 260 deals about totaling $37 billion. As usual, solar rivaled the wind industry and activity. And this year, solar represented 35% of renewable deals with $12.6 billion. So this past year just solidifies that the trend of solar growing has grown and will continue to grow. And that is how the solar equipment supply loan comes into place. We've already now seen that in the next three years, at least 2.5 gigawatts of projects will be in the ground. And why? Because it's become more efficient to do so. Right. Yeah. Right. Obviously, by some of the developers you mentioned, it's kind of globally, it's private and public. These are obviously all over the place. People participating in this market right now. Have most banks been doing the origination activity for these loans or who's been the ones providing the lending on this? For the most part, it has been banks. Some of the main players being Nord, Rabobank, Santander. There are a few life insurance groups that came in, but only two. So we saw a total of 10 deals of these kind, but I've spoken to market sources and these are only the ones that information saw. It's very likely that there were many other deals. The benefit of getting the full ITC was just too appealing, I think. So we have at least 10. The first deal we saw was by Recurrent Energy in September. They borrowed $180 million. And this was the first one that we saw. And so it caught our eye. And since then, we've seen nine other deals. And so what we found the most interesting with these deals is that is the mix of the developers acquiring. So we saw some historically large players in the industry like Recurrent, Clearway, DE Shaw Renewables. But at the same time, we saw developers that we hadn't really seen before in this space. So developers like 7x Energy and C2 Energy. And the thing that's a little shocking was that 7x Energy, their financing allows them to qualify more than two gigawatts of projects. So they're not someone that we've seen really with any gigawatts. I mean, in the project finance space, they've developed some on their own. So we can just expect that this will lead to some new players in the solar space for the next three years, at least. Yeah, especially when you see the available lenders you list here. Right. All over the place, some traditional project finance guys, two points of institutions as well. Very interesting. Well, thanks for talking about it today. Appreciate it. No problem. Thanks for having me. So to sum it up, I'll have Sean before you board a plane for 38 hours or however long. I'm kidding. Don't take that long. But are you doing a non-direct flight or are you going direct? I don't think you can. Well, actually, no. Qantas just tried a direct flight all the way, but that's 19 hours. Okay. But you're fine. I don't know if I want to do that. Yeah, that's fine. But yeah, you go LA and then... Okay. Well, before you go on your cross-global journey here, you have been talking to investors this week about, you know, obviously the Australian migration is one of the bigger lessons I've learned from information is that everybody has the same gig. They're like, oh, yeah, we've done what we can in Aussies and they send us to go to the US to see what we can do, see if we can transfer this energy over to the US different markets. So what have they learned? What have I learned? Look, a lot of hope, obviously. They've got a lot of money and it's ever flowing in because of Australian superannuation system is we have to pay nine and a half percent of our income annually. Just as someone put it yesterday, they've basically got a fire hose in their face and they're trying to deal with that. So, you know, we're starting to see some of the bigger Australian super funds start to set up offices here. Australian super, the biggest one is setting up in March. They've already got someone here, but they're setting up an infrateam to invest directly. They already invest via GP and so on for quite some time. Look, despite the size of the market, I did get a bit of a sense of frustration, as you may experience here. So, you know, they can't do some of the same sort of deals as they can in Australia. The, you know, there's different reluctance obviously to privatise things, whereas governments are more used to that in Australia, albeit it's still controversial and it's a private to private sort of market. You've got a lot more bilateral deals here, you know, less auctions and so forth, which is actually the way the Australian market is kind of switching now because a lot of the big privatisations have kind of come to an end there. So, there's a lot more, it's becoming more like the US market. So, but they're basically, I mean, there's a few areas that have come up that, you know, they do a lot of roads in Australia, that's less so here for the, you know, it's more, you know, people don't like tolls here. They're consistently energy space came up again and again, particularly, you know, midstream gas, the gas sector in general, because of there's so much obviously gas coming out of the ground here, which is actually kind of just, it exists in Australia. There's some big, big operators, listed operators that own pipelines and to put it's usually the oil majors, they're sort of integrated oil majors owning all the LNG infrastructure, which there's a huge amount in Australia, but that's kind of starting to open up. And they're looking at the US, in fact, about how they've managed to do deals here to kind of do similar things over there. But that sector, look, a lot of them operate airports in Australia. They would love to do that here. They're not getting far, obviously, basically. And there's rail, quite a few mentioned sort of short haul rail, that sort of thing, which has not, which doesn't really exist in Australia. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's obviously there's the Patriot deal, which is first state with their first deal in the US. So they're beefing up their team here now as a result of that. So they're midstream. And so, I mean, there's, there's some big ones, obviously, Macquarie has been here for 20 years, and they do everything. And they're into everything, energy, telecommunications, telco and data mentioned quite a lot. Some, I mean, it does vary, it depends on what internal expertise they have, and knowledge, experience of a sector. So some of them haven't touched that at all. And that's the case in Australia as well. It's a very nascent area, telco is only just kicking off there. So obviously, there is, you know, that's got a long way to go. Water was brought up a lot. Big potential. It's the Holy Grail infrastructure. You can't do without it. But similar to Australia, political, it's very sensitive. Few would want to sell their water infrastructure. We've had a couple of things sold in Australia, like desalination plants. But none of the big water sort of authorities, and I don't think that's going to happen too soon. It sounds like not here either. Taking private, you know, listed companies, I understand the, you know, the electricity distribution networks are pretty much all publicly listed already private. Well, we saw two kind of high profile ones take place. Last year was El Paso Electric, which the JP Morgan Infra Fund took out. And obviously, currently, we have the Cincinnati Bell buyout situation with Brookfield and Macquarie, trying to outdo each other. I mean, IFM did the Buckeye one last year, which was another one. Right, right. Yeah, which, you know, they copped a bit of flack in the press for that in Australia. Fossil fuel, representing super funds. Interesting anyway. See how that kind of pans out. And then, look, Canada, it was basically seen as just too hard, too competitive. Canadians have sort of got it tied up. I'm sure there's a lot of P3s, though, going on there. But yeah. Yeah, there's... There's just sort of like, it's just kind of... We've also... Margin compression, all that sort of... We've also gotten calls about how the provincial authorities, like, stick with certain people too. You know, like, they have their favorites and, like, they've been urged to expand and... Yeah. I mean, there's... In New Zealand, there's a consortium headed by CDBQ Infra, going for a light rail project there. And they're trying to export, I think, a model that they put in place in Montreal, which they become the actual delivery authority, even, to take over the whole government role there. It looks like they may get that. But yeah. Latin America came up consistently. Okay. From everybody, I think, just about as definitely an opportunity. Lots of different risks. Did they just say... I mean, were they centered around OECD in Brazil? Is that kind of how it was termed to you? Or are they, like, being more holistic? No. No. I mean, a little bit, you know, they're not... Look, usually it is OECD. Having said that, some of the super funds, you know, some of them have fairly large allocations to emerging markets. Okay. So, they want that high return. Obviously, high risk. But it's, you know, it's a small part of the portfolio. Yeah. So, consistently, Brazil, not so much. They said that was the currency transfer was difficult, as well as competitive, you know, market. Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina was mentioned the other day. Yeah. Depending on, you know, sometimes they just stop because of some major corruption scandal or something. Well, that's a whole other program for another time. That's just the way it is. But yeah, it's just basically because it's less contested. Right. I guess. Yeah. Well, Sean, that is all the time we have. We thank you for sharing your time with us. Thank you for having me. Mali and Melissa, thanks for coming on, as always. Looking forward to the next program. Berk out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2020-01-13 16:51:39+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Chat with Brendon Duval of Glenfarne Group\n**Episode ID:** 4450\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nThis is John Burke. Welcome to the inaugural Crossroads podcast of 2020. We're delighted today to be joined today by Glenn Foreign Group's Managing Director, Brendan Duvall. Brendan, welcome to the program. Thank you for having me. Great. And Jonathan Carmody. Hi, JB. As always, the news editor of Latin America for information. Before we get into the show, guys, I just wanted to give a quick recap about what our viewers or readers missed at the end of 2019, if they were off in Europe or skiing in the Alps. There was a major infrastructure deal away from infrastructure, so to speak, when Brookfield Infrastructure Partners did a buyout of Cincinnati Bell for $2.6 billion, a storied, storied high yield name being taken out by an infrastructure fund. The after effects of that, I think, will be very close to watch in 2020. The other side of the 2020 equation was going to be the St. Louis airport privatization. And shortly before Christmas, the mayor canceled that project, citing lack of business support for the project, despite receiving 18 requests for qualification or RFQs submitted. At this point, I'd say every major infrastructure fund in the world except for Glenn Foreign did submit that, submit those bids. Everybody thought that this could be a harbinger of things to come in the airport space. And now they're more like, well, in the U.S., same old, same old, you know, two steps forward, 10 steps back. So we'll see what happens there. So, Brendan, we're not here to talk about airports. We're here to talk about Glenn Farms platform and how it resonates with both Latin American economies, as well as today in the U.S. You guys had announced back in December about Alder Midstream closing the purchase of Dallas-based natural gas gathering and processing business IACX Energy. You guys were also the majority owner of a LNG export project in Brownsville, Texas. So the more I look into natural gas and the environment that's out there, you know, you see terms like saturated, oversupplied, low prices and the competitive nature of it now competing with solar and wind as those prices have come down. What can you tell me about this investment for starters? And where do you see Alder's role in this environment? Well, thank you. Thank you for inviting me. Alder Midstream is a platform we've launched to own and operate and develop midstream infrastructure companies, not unlike we've developed the Enfrogen Power Platform. Given the bulk of midstream investing is in North America, that is predominantly focused on North America, but we do see some midstream opportunities in LATAM. You reference the saturated and the low price of gas. And we think when we invest into midstream infrastructure, we need to play into the arms of that low priced gas. And so Alder has three distinct areas of value creation. And as a reminder, we're always looking to be a developer, an owner, an operator, we can turn assets around. So we're looking for deep value opportunities. We've now got 350 people in the broader platform, the bulk of them are engineers. So that allows us to get into some interesting opportunities. So how does the Texas LNG development? Well, obviously, low price gas makes US LNG export attractive. So the Texas LNG initiative, in particular, our view that seaborne LNG, particularly up and down the Americas, is a growth market. We think it's a fantastic project. And LNG projects are typically mega. This is the smallest fully FERC approved LNG project in the Gulf Coast, which allows us to go to our financial close in FID with a lot of less moving parts than the mega projects. And so we're very excited. And we do hope that gas prices stay in a moderate range, because that'll be very attractive to our to our offtakers. In the gathering and processing side of things, IACX Energy is a specialist in long dated and well understood basins and formations where there's very predictable gas flows. And often we can buy very well these gathering systems because the low price of gas. But in particular, IACX has a specialty of extracting extra value out of the gas flows that not a lot of other owners of gathering systems focus on, which is the helium. And helium is a commodity that is becoming more scarce and under more demand because it literally vents up into the atmosphere, just like a balloon floats away, the gas itself does. And so by being able to monetize helium in these acquisitions and apply a more focused approach to managing these older systems, we see a lot more value in them than the sellers and or the current owners. And so that and particularly with lower price gas, those previous owners are less likely to continue investing, whereas our team and our approach is a specialty. And it also avoids less competition when we're when we're looking at those valuations. The third leg of ALDA again plays to the hand of low price gas, where some gas is so remote or there's so much gas out there, it's shut in and it's shut in because there's so much constraint. And so we're looking at investing in infrastructure that converts either methane or ethane into an alternative, whether a liquid or a solid. And we think there's a range of those opportunities there. That's that third leg of the stool for ALDA is at a very early stage. But that that will also be focused on North America. What's the timeframe for Brownsville at this point? So we would expect to go to groundbreaking FID in about 12 months from now. So early 2021, we had a very exciting moment where we got our full final FERC approval in November. So now we're finalising debt consortiums and finalising the EPC process. And we'd expect to announce updates on both of those in Q2. What's the capacity in terms of trains? So there'll be two trains, each at two megatons per annum. So a total of four megatons, which is multiple smaller than a lot of the big guys, albeit any one train is roughly the same economy of scale other than the storage tank as the big guys. And so we've got oversupply of at least quality offtakers under LOI for our volumes. And we're focused on Asia and second tier Europe for that offtake. And just last question on that point, you mentioned maybe there's some opportunities in Latin America for the platform. Were there any specifics around the geographies there that could be interesting or other than both continents anywhere else? So we're focused on high grade Latin America, so investment grade Latin America. And as you know, the bulk of that now is actually OECD. So we see there's opportunities in Chile, Colombia, and even though there's pipelines in Mexico, there's still areas of stranded demand and still a lack of supply of gas into areas in Mexico. So wherever we can, either whether it's an LNG or helping with domestic infrastructure, we think we can help those economies by some investment with our embedded knowledge of the power markets there. So it would be the same places where we have our power plants. Sure. Good launching point for you to go into Latin America, Jonathan, to go for it. Yeah, great. And one of the things I was thinking there when you're developing an LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, you know, you're in the Gulf of Mexico. I'm thinking with the acquisition of Terma Flores last year, there's surely going to be a link up in the kind of supply chain that you're using there. Tell us about the logistics of that. Yeah. So clearly, they are two standalone companies with separate capital structures and separate partners. So the most important thing is the knowledge base that Glenfarm brings to both companies. So on the InfraGen side, we're currently filling cargo of LNG coming across the Gulf Coast from Sabine Pass to the Terma Flores plant. And so our knowledge of those gas flows in the Caribbean are very useful when we think about how to monetize any excess capacity from the Texas LNG facility. We don't see there being an explicit contractual link between our power business and our LNG business. However, both businesses get the knowledge of the economics and the flows. And I think it makes us a better buyer of LNG on behalf of the power business and a better seller of LNG on the side of the midstream business. Great. And you know, Terma Flores was, I think, your first gas-fired power plant. It's a backup plant in Colombia. You also got an interesting investor to join you on that deal. So Partners Group came aboard. What did Partners Group bring to Glenfarm and to InfraGen and Prime in particular? So we were really proud and excited to have such a prestigious firm such as Partners Group come in to the platform. The Swiss are very particular in their approach to investing. It was an extremely rigorous process. We spent time in Switzerland, in Latin America, in North America. And we'd known Partners Group for six years. It was a very long dating process. We met them every two years, and we updated them, and we updated them. And finally, we consummated this transaction. So they're on the board, and we share the board together with Glenfarm and Partners Group. And we're actually going down with a whole bunch of their team to go through all of our Chilean power plants, for example, next week to see where we can jointly add value and share ideas. And so they've got tremendous experience, and they're managing $90Bn. So the broad experience of different settings in different countries around the world just gives us a greater, broader team. Okay. And with that investment from Partners Group, is that going to be put to use in all of the companies that Glenfarm operates in the region? So that's just into InfraGen. So they're our partners in InfraGen. We'd be delighted if we could do some more business outside of InfraGen with them. But it comes into the holding company of InfraGen. And the bulk of the first tranche of that partnership is to build out the Colombian business. So allowed us to fund Tumaflores in Colombia. But we're growing our solar portfolio as well. So we've approved some additional solar investment already that'll consume some of that capital. So yeah, broadly across the whole InfraGen platform, we expect to be working together. Great. Great. And when you say solar, is that also in Colombia? So the focus for our solar initiative is Chile and Panama. And so there's a fantastic program called the PMGD program in Chile, where they have a very well-run regulated tariff there, stabilised tariff. And then we have a footprint in Panama, where we like that market for various reasons. And so they're the two markets our solar initiative is focused. Colombia is not quite where we'd like to see it yet for various reasons. And particularly their program had a lot of bidding that was at prices that aren't as interesting to us at the moment. But we do envisage, as a solar platform grows, to actually make some investment in Colombia. Okay. And, you know, we talked about Colombia and Chile. They're two countries that last year saw very turbulent political situations. There was a lot of social unrest, a lot of protests. How do you manage that at Glenfarrin? How do you monitor those situations? And what effect does it really have on your businesses? You know, when you're an owner of infrastructure in anyone's backyard, in anyone's country, anyone's state, anyone's town or city, you have to realise you're part of the community there. And so in reality, you might be a power plant owner-operator or a toll road owner-operator, in our case, a power plant operator. But really, your prime business is government relations and community relations. So we made a big effort to build out a focused effort of communication and touch points with all layers of government, from the ministerial, to the senators, to the diputados, to the city leaders. And so as this unrest was unfolding, we had a whole group of people that were communicating regularly, daily, weekly, monthly, with all of them, so we could understand how we could help and engage and protect if ever needed. And so it was a readiness that I was very proud of the team in Chile and also in the US that's on the board that set that up. So we've spent a lot of time meeting with key players and reinforced our confidence that the best defence to this unrest is to pick the best countries to begin with, that have a proven track record of working through difficult situations and not sort of flipping to more difficult regimes, as has happened in Venezuela, for example, to choose an extreme. So primarily having the best economies to go into that have a track record of dealing with issues, and then secondly, communicating very closely when problematic issues arise. Okay. And you mentioned attractive markets. Well, Colombia and Chile are both very, very strong markets. Chile in particular has that track record you talk about of respect for investments, especially foreign investments. But we see the largest market in Latin America is Brazil. We also mentioned Mexico, but I'm just curious if there's prospects that you're seeing out there in those countries that might be interesting for any one of the businesses of Glenfine? So Mexico is definitely, it's OECD, it's Spanish speaking, so that's right down the middle for us. It's power market is in US dollars. We see the power market there going through quite a difficult time to invest new dollars into the main CFE portion of the power market, where we see tremendous opportunity is due to the difficulty of CFE to keep up with the demand growth. It's supplying power to what is still a very robust economy and a growth in manufacturing and a growth in industry there. So we're looking to install power plants off-grid inside the fence to help bridge the demand and the power supply until CFE can catch up in five to 10 years. And we also believe that gives us a nice footprint there. So when CFE opens up for more business, such as it might have been a few years ago, we'll be well positioned in the country. So we do expect to enter Mexico through a distributed generation approach. We're working through that with our partners group now to come up with a business plan. So that's a work in progress. Partners obviously with the experience that they have in Mexico, you know, with Formaca and the midstream space. They have a lot of information on Mexico, that's for sure. Absolutely. Brazil for us, it's non-OECD, it's non-investment grade, it's a different language and a different culture. So that doesn't mean it's not a good place to make money. But when you think of building out a team with a level of focus, our focus has been on Spanish-speaking Latin America and investment grade Latin America. And so Brazil, one thing I would say about Brazil, it really is a standalone economy. And when you study economies around the world, it's one of the most internalised economies in the world. And it has probably the least amount of need for a lot of foreign investment in reality. They'd love a lot of it and they'd take in a lot, but it actually survives a lot on domestic. And so that's a new decision. And that'll be at a later date that's not part of our current this year, next year thinking. Great. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's right. That's right. And in terms of the other jurisdictions, you know, Central America, obviously with your Panamanian investments, they've got a new president there. I'm sure you're keeping abreast of the situation. But, you know, are you seeing opportunities for more power generation projects there? What's their matrix looking like? Yeah. So Panama, we think it's a great country. You know, it's been a friend of the US for a long time. US dollar economy, investment grade, I think it should be knocking on the door of OECD. It's not quite there yet. We do see opportunity there in the market. We are looking at solar there. We see it is very different to the rest of Central America, as you could imagine. But yeah, we're looking at solar. If we can negotiate some additional hydro plants there, we'd be interested. But it remains a good economy. There's some overhang in the power sector there with two major projects, LNG, gas-fired projects that have got a lot of uncertainty around them. They may or may not be built. They're heavily delayed. So that provides a little bit of cloud for people who aren't in the market. But when you're inside the market and you understand the way the power price is set, that cloudiness is actually quite easy to see through. I wanted to talk about just sort of the investment climate to sort of close it out. I really should have the dry powder numbers tattooed in my head at this point. But you can get an illustration in the sense that we have one $22Bn fund that's closed in Brookfield and another one that's coming close in Global Infrastructure Partners. $22Bn apiece and then $14Bn raised through Blackstone. And on and on it goes. So you're talking about dry powder, you're talking about a competitive environment. And obviously, when you talk about the midstream, that's also been a very heavy focus of a lot of these infrastructure funds. So what's your view on the competitive spectrum now for you? And how does Glenfarden intend to sort of maintain its edge through looking at all these different investment opportunities? So it's very, very interesting. I started in infrastructure when I joined Macquarie back in the beginning of my career in the mid to late 90s. And we really didn't see another infrastructure fund until about 2006, so kind of 10 years into my career. It was the main part of what I did. And we started to see multiples run up on assets. And what I had observed back then is actually how do you avoid competing at the high multiples and still stay active? And my approach to infrastructure has been building businesses around infrastructure. So that's what we do at Glenfarden. So when you're building businesses around infrastructure, generally, we're not pursuing the mega assets. And the real dry powder volume of supply in abundance is in the larger assets, particularly these large funds. And so what we often see is we're buying or building or developing assets that those larger funds don't have the manpower to go after. So we're sort of staying under the radar financially, but also getting into situations where it requires more of an operator's mindset to turn an asset around, develop a new commercial strategy, or build something from scratch. And then when they're built into a bigger platform, then our valuation can pick up and our valuation gets uplifted by this need to buy assets. And we think that the valuations of our platforms, and even just very sensible valuations, meet the needs of this dry powder, whether it's the dry powder of a pension plan or a manager of pension plan money through a fund. So we actually are quite excited about the volume of dry powder because we're not competing against it, but we're creating businesses that the valuations of those businesses get dragged up by that dry powder. But we're not typically competing. When you buy an asset that's got opportunity to enhance it through physical or commercial turnaround, you're not competing with the dry powder. You know, 2011, right? That's when you found the Glen Farn. Are you viewing the investment platforms that you built up as buy and hold, or is there going to be monetisation to be had? I learnt at my time at Macquarie and studying other investors, we underwrite and we build these businesses as if the business is going to own the assets forever. So when we think of the quality of effort we put into underwriting and buying assets in Infragen or Alda, we do always try to run the businesses that if a buyer or an investor came along and said, you know what, I really like this platform. Can I come in and diligence and buy it? We try to run a private company with a quality of information prep that we could sell some equity or the platform at any point in time. Our partners in our platforms, we need capital to continue to grow. We're long-term interested in our platforms, but to bring in partners, we need to take into account their needs. And so we do have mechanisms where we can create exit opportunities and or allow our partners to sell or sell the whole platform. So I always say we invest to own forever and we're always open to a sale. Well, Brendan, thank you for coming on the program today. Really appreciate it. Hopefully you've gotten a lot out of this program to the listeners and we'll see you next month. Berk out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2019-12-19 13:35:18+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Holiday Edition\n**Episode ID:** 4451\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the holiday edition of the Crossroads podcast, where we promise to deliver you the best infrastructure news in 30 minutes or less, or deliver you a free pizza. I'm your host, John Burke, America's editor, and today we focus on 2020 and what's to come in infrastructure for the U.S. and in Latin America. Joining me live in the studio is Abigail Miller, Daniella Urias, and then calling in on the phone from Brooklyn is Jonathan Carmody. Welcome to the show, guys. Thanks, JB. Thanks, JB. Thanks for having us. So Abby, we've had a year, I think, measured by actual progress, I think, in the P3 market relative to 2018, I would say. And there seems to be, and I almost say that because where there's certain processes that unfolded in 2019, there seems to be the promise that there could actually be projects executed in 2020. Based on what we've seen before, now we're all crossing our fingers, you've crossed your fingers, I've crossed mine, because there's politics involved, there's issues that come up all the time in the U.S. But why don't you walk us through where we're going in 2020, what we should be looking out for as the new year comes into focus for the U.S. and Canadian market? Yeah. Thanks, JB. So basically, the 2019 market was highlighted by the social infrastructure market. It was almost a breakout year for this sector. We'd seen it before, but this year it really grew. I've talked to a lot of people who said procurement agencies, they really like these projects because they go a little bit more quickly, there's a little bit less political risk. It really shows that the P3 model can work. Here's how, here are all the successes. Just a few days ago, we saw a pretty big success with the University of Iowa selecting a winning bidder in the Meridian NG team, which shows the strength of the model. And next in 2020, it's looking like the University of Alabama is launching a similar project. So I'm sure we'll be seeing and hearing a lot of that in the next year. And other social projects that can lead the market in the next year, the LA Civic Center and the Blaisdell Center in Hawaii. Blaisdell Center intends to shortlist before the end of the year. And so we could see that reach financial close in the next year. The LA Civic Center was pushed back a little bit. They said it's just pretty routine planning, but I think we'll see the RFP issued sometime in the first half of the year, hopefully before April. And a preferred bidder could definitely still be named before the end of the year, but all considering that, you know, we can't promise anything. Another big success was that the St. Louis Airport Project finally hit the market. They're expected to shortlist bidders basically any minute now. And so once that happens, it's poised to reach financial close in the next year, hopefully. And that could be another big success in the market. That's one we've been waiting for. And I think with all the planning they put in, if they reach financial close, it could show not only the success of the model, but also the benefits of waiting and putting in so much planning and taking their time bringing it to market. By comparison, the Canadian market, which is, you know, usually kind of the, I don't know, the standard bearer. Yeah, the standard bearer. It's been slow in 2019. The IOP pipeline finally came out, I think that was in August, maybe in September. It was September, yeah. In September, yeah. And you know, that's very, very late considering it's usually the beginning of the year that that's out. While it did boast the highest dollar amount, most of that dollar amount is in a couple very, very mega subway projects right in central Ontario. Like the Ontario line, which I was talking to a source earlier today said, you know, that project, because of the size and complexity and risk associated with it, because it's essentially 15 kilometers of tunneling, you know, that could be stuck in P3 limbo for years. And, you know, I guess sources are a little bit skeptical considering the issues with the risk, with risk allocation. And it's also, you know, it's kind of a contractor's market right now in that there's a lot of other projects that they can do, design, build, or more commercial projects, and, you know, why are they going to take the risk on a project that they ultimately won't make as much money on? But I mean, you know, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which the, I guess, newly reelected liberal party, but it's a minority party, you know, they're really touting the successes of that. Some sources have been really optimistic about it, said they've had really great interactions, you know, it seems like they're going to do big things. Other sources have pointed out that the promises that they have made are just promises that the federal government would have made anyway, and it just got pushed off to the CIB, so it looks like the CIB is doing something. So that's, I mean, kind of interesting, and another source explained that all the projects that they've been promising to the CIB, they're so far off that it almost doesn't feel like real money that they're promising. It's, you know, it's such a far-off promise that they, you know, they don't have to worry about it right in the moment. But to end on a high note about next year, another project that's looking like it could be promising is the Maryland Managed Lanes Project. It's another one we've been waiting on, it's a, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it'll be an $11 billion project, maybe more, yeah. Jennifer Ahman, who's president of Transurban in the U.S., said that it looks like it could be a really promising, it looks like they could be considering a project development agreement model, which is just a different way of doing P3s, which she explained kind of gives everyone involved a little bit more flexibility and makes such a competitive and huge project on the bidding side a little bit more realistic and reduces risk a little bit. And, you know, Transurban is actually in charge of extending the Virginia side of the lanes upward. And she said that if they go with this version of the P3 delivery model, that they would be more interested in it, in Transurban, I mean. The DOT did see a shakeup the other day. The director, or secretary of the DOT, Pete Rahn, stepped down to spend a little bit more time at home in New Mexico with his family. Greg Slater, who was the director of the State Highway Administration, is stepping up and filling in for him. But apparently Slater's very popular, he actually took his last job from Rahn also, Rahn was head of the State Highway Administration now, and Slater took that as well, so it seems like it could be a pretty smooth transition. So, yeah, it looks like 2020 could be a big year, both in terms of projects coming to close, but also projects coming to market and seeing some really competitive bidding. It's good to hear, and, you know, obviously it sounds like the next chapter's just going to unfold in the first half of the year in some of these Civic Center projects, but it sounds like Iowa, in and of itself, closing could be a really big harbinger, I think, in the university space, particularly now you're seeing it repeated. Ohio State, you know, it was done the first time, great, now it's repeated, the same kind of thing, you have a partnership, you have an upfront payment to the university, it gets recycled into focusing on education, which is where I think everyone's trying to unlock the value, focus on education, let private partners worry about the rest of the school, and so maybe that message gets brought forth to other large public schools. Yeah, well, and it shows kind of that the underlying, you know, the thing that's causing success there, obviously it's the university's willingness to participate, but it is also the market, or, sorry, not the market, like the model, the P3 model that's driving the success, as opposed to it just being like a, you know, working really well for Ohio State, but not being necessarily a great model at other schools. If other schools can repeat it, then I think it just goes to show how successful the model can be, and it's probably a really good thing for the market. So, from university utilities, we shift to listed utilities. Daniela is a research analyst with us, and she's been doing a lot of work in this area, and particularly comes at an interesting time for this discussion, as we have two utilities that are in the market for, you know, essentially take private transactions, JEA out of Jacksonville, and Santee Cooper, which is South Carolina, I believe. If you want to add a number, three, go right, it's not apples to apples, but PREPA is also looking for privatization partners down in Puerto Rico, although the reasons there are more, well, it's a different story entirely. So, Daniela, why don't you talk, walk us through what's going on in this space right now, and what's to come, and I guess it would be important not to acknowledge the fact that, again, this becomes a highly politically driven process, in the sense that you are a rate payer, and you face the prospect of getting privatized. So, I think it's going to be interesting to see, we know JEA and Santee Cooper in the market, how it gets to the finish line, and how that deal is structured is going to be very interesting to see. So, I'll let you go away. Of course. So, historically, this has been something that we've been seeing, consolidation within the utility sector. Up to date, it's consolidated 60%, which is a large consolidation. We're going to be seeing an increased movement in the M&A utility sector that we expect to continue in the upcoming year. Public utilities are finding their balance sheet constrained as electricity sales decline due to reduced consumption and energy efficiency improvements. So, what that's resulting in is that large investor-owned utilities are turning to M&As, specifically acquiring regulated utilities, public utilities, as an alternative to invest in capital-intensive projects to increase the scale of their operations. So, these large utilities are seeing, these public utilities that are facing balance sheet constraints as an efficient way to expand their territory without investing a lot of money into these large projects. We've seen in the past, ScanaCorp was acquired by Dominion Energy. The sale came after Scana's decision to abandon the proposed expansion of the VC summer nuclear power plant, along with Santee Cooper. So, ScanaCorp wanted to privatize. Dominion Energy acquired them, and now Santee Cooper, which was in the same deal with them, is now going through a privatization. In the past year, Moody's cut the sector outlook for U.S.-regulated utilities to negative from stable. So, this means that we're going to continue seeing more utilities going to take private, being acquired by large investor-owned utilities. So, we have PREPA, which, as you mentioned, isn't the same case. We have JEA, Santee Cooper. To mention other utilities, we have the Bonneville Power Administration and the Los Angeles Power Authority, which were also downgraded in their outlook. So, it's going to be happening into 2020. Hopefully, we'll see these two privatizations come through in that year. Recently, Jacksonville shortlisted nine firms, including Duke Energy, Veolia, eMERA, and Nextera. And in November 26th, it was valued at $7.9 billion to $11 billion. So, we're looking at those numbers for a potential sale. We also have South Carolina, Santee Cooper. Their proposals were due November. We've heard that potential bidders are Nextera, Duke Energy, Southern Co., and Dominion Energy. So, you see the same players being active within the sector. Next era is subsidiary, Florida Power and Light. This past year acquired the city of Vero Beach Electric Utility. So, it's going to be the same players trying to expand their territories, whether it's in Florida, South Carolina. And it's definitely something we're going to be continuing seeing into the next year. Terrific. I mean, I noticed the one thing is that you're not mentioning how the infrastructure funds are playing this quite yet. But, you know, you've researched and we're all aware that there are a few platforms out there, although it's not clear whether they're going to concentrate on these larger public utilities quite yet. But obviously, something like Global Infrastructure Partners has assets like this, I suppose, where they could go in there. Of course, we saw the case of El Paso Electric Company. It was recently acquired by JP Morgan Infrastructure Investments Fund. So, in 2018, they received an unsolicited acquisition approach. And that just spurred a flurry of M&A interest. And the acquisition was made. Unfortunately, the El Paso Electric rating was downgraded after the acquisition. So, that's a different case. Generally, this is supposed to be something beneficial. But we'll see. Potentially, funds will continue to be more interested in the sector as well. Great. Well, thanks for that update, Daniela. Last but not least, Jonathan Carmody. Well, I think, sir, we've seen a very, well, another volatile here in Latin America go down. But we saw investment. We saw the traditional countries like Brazil and Mexico benefit from that investment on the, at least on the M&A front. And Chile gets included in that category as well as Colombia to some extent. Of course, it just was a very bad quarter to end it with all these protests going on in different countries, which just provided a kind of a bad visual on where things are. But perhaps you can just walk us through, you know, what's really coming in 2020, you know, take a step back and then walk us through what's coming next in the space. Yeah, absolutely. And it's important to take a step back because there was some really significant transactions in Latin America last year. And when we look at the deals that got done in the M&A space, certainly the deals that were awarded, even if they haven't closed yet. TAG, the biggest deal that information has seen happened in Brazil. NG and CDPQ picked up the gas network from Petrobras, which is one of many Brazilian privatizations that we're expecting. You know, we've got the refinery sale, which is accepting binding bids in the next few months. They're discussing Eletrobras and how to do the privatization there. They're looking to change the law to facilitate that. So I think we're going to see major activity in Brazil, major activity. You know, there's a lot of greenfield highways to be tendered as well. The country, according to the IFC, who gave a fantastic presentation at our conference, really, really needs sanitation infrastructure. So we should expect to see some movement, possibly in the privatization of some of the water concessions. And yes, certainly some water treatment plants and that kind of infrastructure. But again, I think you said, take a step back before we look forward. One of the big stories in 2019 has definitely been the influx of Chinese money into the region. Some of the major deals that got done, both of the SEMPRA privatizations, not privatization, sorry, the asset sales in Chilquinta in Chile and Luz del Sur in Peru, both went to Chinese state-backed companies. Chagia, the Odebrecht hydroelectric plant, was sold to a Chinese company. It just seems like at the moment... And don't forget, on SEMPRA too, don't forget, these were competitive processes, right? I mean, they were outbidding the international consortium for these assets. Italy's NL made a lot of noise. They said they were determined to bid for it. We haven't just found out exactly what happened with the bid for it. We haven't just found out exactly what happened with the bidding, with the pricing. But it looks like, yeah, the Chinese just stormed it. Again, the Metro de Bogotá, we've seen that go to another Chinese team. And some of the other rail projects in Colombia are also being bid on by Chinese firms, as are some of the projects in Peru, as we published yesterday, the Lima Eco train. So we can expect that trend to continue definitely into 2020. Partho Sanyal of Bank of America gave us a wonderful presentation again at the conference, where he described exactly how Chinese bidders are approaching the market. And the level of sophistication that they've now achieved is really setting themselves up to be very, very competitive. Excellent. So what can you tell us about the protests here that have taken place across Ecuador and Chile and Colombia, and how it's going to affect infrastructure development? Again, these countries have programs for infrastructure development. They're procuring projects. And it's safe to say all this will hit a standstill when all these protests started. But they were infrastructure related why these protests were in place in the first place. So what can you tell us about sort of the impacts that these are going to have on the greenfields programs in these different countries? Everybody's got that question on their mind. And in Chile, a lot of the initial protests started around a hike in the fares for the urban metro system. But then later, it expanded into more kind of social economic issues. Ecuador had a similar problem, trying to push through reforms, trying to liberalize the country. And Colombia is trying to push through a major tax reform. And they also saw massive protests that shut down the country in recent weeks. But what I'm hearing from investors is really that these are long term bets they're making on these countries. The contracts are long term, 15, 20 year contracts. And, you know, these are good tests for Latin America in their eyes. You know, they try to put a positive spin on it. Yes, there's this kind of discontent in the country with social policy and what's happening. But there's also a feeling that these countries are, you know, becoming much more sophisticated in the way that they tender concessions, the way that they open up to private investment. Chile obviously is the most established player in the concession space. We've seen many, many highway and hospital concessions in Chilean PPPs. And that's likely to continue. The government's talked about its massive infrastructure fund, which it wants to set up to help finance new works, to help transfer assets to new developers. They have a massive hospitals program, which they're looking to tender. So we'll be paying close attention to that and trying to see how the winds are blowing in Chile. But certainly, I think the mood around Latin America has been around dialogue. You know, people want to talk to the protesters, take them seriously. You know, they've been incredibly successful at shutting things down. Now it's going to be a question of explaining, OK, what do they want? What's the coherent message from these protesters? And how good are the government's going to be at responding to that? Colombia is a good example of that. You know, they've had incredible success at attracting investment with the 4G program and the highways. They're looking to move on now to the 5G program, start developing new projects, start tendering new roads. They're also going to be tendering hospitals and other social infrastructure assets. And so, you know, this is a real challenge for them. Investors have said, we believe in Colombia. We're excited about Colombia. But we really want to see how the government deals with this. You know, are they able to weather the storm? Are they able to get back to business as soon as possible and to keep people satisfied? Or is this going to be a real handicap on how they tend to process this? So I think it'll be very interesting to see in the early months of the year. There's plenty of plans, plenty of projects that need to get done. Investors are looking at the lips of the prospects that are on the table. But it's going to be a question of how the demonstrators and how the protesters negotiate with the government and how they come to some kind of agreement. Let's just conclude here with Mexico. Obviously, you yourself have been covering a ton of M&A deal flow against, like, almost sort of a withdrawal of sorts under the AMLO government of, like, greenfield projects. There's no federal program in place. It's all state run at this point. You know, but yet you see this deal flow. And that's the compare and contrast there. Where's the return for these investment dollars at this point in these mature projects relative to the fact that Mexico doesn't want to develop any new projects, which just seems a little bit, you know, startling on some level? Well, AMLO came out with his plan recently. Everyone had been waiting for that infrastructure plan. He had about 120, 140 projects in there. A lot of investors said, look, you know, some of these are already tendered. Some of these are already awarded projects. They're not providing new investment opportunities. So, yes, there's a certain amount of skepticism about what new opportunities are going to come into Mexico. We saw the Tren Maya fluctuated throughout the year between being a 90 percent private finance project to being a more like 10 percent private finance project. So, they're still finding their feet. They're still realizing what they have to do and how they can do it. But there were definitely some very worrying signs in the renewable space. We saw that they cancelled the auction at the start of AMLO's government. So, that would be the fourth capacity auction in the country. And then later in the year, they decided they were going to change the sales regime. So, this is the clean energy certificates, which are a kind of renewable investment promotion scheme. These were able to be exchanged by companies selling the electricity in the renewable project. And the government decided to apply those credits to historic projects that were owned by the government, CFE. This, of course, provoked a severe reaction from investors and they've gone out and they've put out judicial injunctions against this program. So, I think we're going to see a real tug of war in 2022. These projects are valuable right now. If you keep the regimes and the positive kind of benefits in place for these developers, then they'll continue to be attractive. But how is the government going to behave? We still don't really know yet. We've seen worrying signs. We've seen these kind of arbitrary moves by the AMLO government and how they apply this kind of legislation to projects almost without warning. But we've also seen that the developers are willing to stand up and defend their rights. The courts at the moment seem to be siding with them as they've suspended the changes based on recent injunctions that the private sector has brought against the government. So, one of the things I heard when I was down in Mexico City is that really all of the projects that people are developing in the renewable space are for sale, whether there's a formal process or not. Everybody's listening to offers. A lot of people are looking for exits in their projects. And as I said, in the current terms, these will be attractive projects. We've seen players like Macquarie acquiring projects. We've seen other funds coming into the market. And we're really excited to see who's brave enough to go into Mexico, which are going to be the right projects. While everything may be for sale, not every project is connected to the right point. It's not got the right load that investors want. So, it's going to be really interesting to see who targets which projects, which ones get the most attention from investors. But definitely, it's going to be very active for the near future. Great. And a lot of lines to watch. Well, that's all the time we got for the holiday edition of the Crossroads Podcast. We're wishing you a happy holidays and a healthy new year. On that note, Burke out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2019-12-13 14:52:18+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Interview with Kent Rowey of Allen & Overy\n**Episode ID:** 4452\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the December edition of the Crossroads podcast where we promise to deliver you the best infrastructure news in 30 minutes or less or deliver you a free pizza. I'm your host John Burke, America's Editor for Information and joining me today and a very busy man these days Kent Rowe, a partner in the Projects Energy and Infrastructure Group at Allen & Overy. Thanks for joining us today. It's a pleasure. And also of course another busy man, information reporter Andrew Vitelli. Thanks for coming to the program today Andrew. Yep, thanks for having me on. Kent, we're trying to end the year here but there's still too many things to deal with it looks like. I thought this would be a good way to kick off the show to talk about I think what's gonna be a very hot-button issue in 2020 and that's fund deployment. We seem to be in the final stages of both Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners closing the latest iteration of their funds at 22 billion from the latest public totals. Blackstone Infrastructure Partners will was at 14 billion as of the third quarter for their open-ended fund and then it sounds like there's another iteration of existing asset managers yet to come in 2020 raising money. So from all this, lots of dry powder, what industries do you think will attract inflow from these funds in 2020 and why? Yeah, it's an interesting trend in the fund space with these funds growing to the size they're growing. I mean Brookfield and GIP have been big funds for a while now and so that's probably less surprising than some of the funds who started out in the middle market space and at fund three or four have grown by multiples of about three or four. For example, I squared, EQT, Stone Peak. What it does is put those funds into a different category in terms of equity check obviously and funds of that size are reluctant to devote resources to deals that don't meet their check size criteria. So I think what that does is force some of these funds into larger transactions and in particular look at the take private space. So there are private assets for sale but not many of a size that would meet the equity check criteria. So these funds will be looking at publicly listed companies and look to take private or for carve-outs from publicly listed funds. And one area that I think has been you know a little ignored with the exception of IFM, it's a deal a couple of years ago, are some of the big infrastructure slash construction companies that are publicly listed particularly in Spain. Their stock price has been depressed for a while. There seems to be value there and for funds of this size you could see structures for example like an LBO of one of those big funds where you buy the company, take it private, you sell off the construction assets and keep the infrastructure portfolio. So I think there will be a lot of deals like that. I still maintain some hope for public to private on the transportation side. I know that sector has been slow in in recent years particularly in the surface transportation area but there are assets still available around the country and with the right policy push I see potential in you know potentially monetizing big turnpikes. For example where you need checks of you know 250, 300 up to 500 million dollars. In addition I think there's going to be further consolidation in the utility space. You know for example water utilities or combination, multi utilities, combination of electricity, water, etc. And you know Jacksonville is a case in point and I think there's trapped value in a lot of public or municipally owned utilities that could be unlocked through a monetization type of transaction. You know potentially some activity around in those spaces but it's it's going to be a challenge because there is a scarcity of assets sort of in general given current you know macroeconomic conditions. It's you know still I think pretty much a seller's market and difficult to find value when you're looking at transactions of that size. But it certainly I think pushes these funds into looking at publicly traded companies for carve outs and and take privates. Yeah there's actually been talk that JEA might get sold in two transactions. Of course the water utility on one end and the power utility on the other. Yes. And I'm sure they're getting you know bids in that area because of that. But that's um. Santee was announced not so long ago. Bids are in and that's also a fairly sizable transaction and it's a multi utility and so you could see prospects for maybe breaking it up and selling off different bits of it. Interesting. Andrew. So one one area that we've seen a lot of activity in 2019 and probably even more interest is the university and college campus utility space where private companies and private infrastructure funds have been getting in and in some cases paying an upfront payment for a campus utility system. And just this week we saw a big deal with a more than 1 billion dollar upfront payment at the University of Iowa approved. Now now we're still early innings here. There have only been a few of these deals that have reached financial close. But it seems like there really is something of a pipeline and I'm curious why you think this space has maybe had more success in bringing you know in maintaining interest so far at least than we've seen in other p3 areas. So this is a sector that's near and dear to my heart and you know I've been lucky enough to been involved in you know the OSU transaction for the winning team and full disclosure since you mentioned Iowa, our firm is representing the winning bidding team Engie and Meridian on on that transaction and I was leading our team. So I'm a little constrained to what I can say specifically about Iowa apart from what is is public. But in terms of a trend university transactions of that type I think make a lot of sense and the reason is that a university's core mission is education and research and a lot of the big universities also have medical centers that are attached to them and see their mission as providing education resource and medical services rather than running their infrastructure. It's a non core component of the university's mission. In addition even big universities with healthy endowments I think are looking to get their balance sheets in order and to augment their endowments by monetizing these assets. So you really solve a couple of problems you you resolve issues on the balance sheet and or you know repaying debt for example and or adding some funds to the endowment and the same time you relieve the university of the responsibility of running a utility an energy utility embedded within the campus and instead you look to the private sector you do a long-term lease and essentially outsource the utility service to the private sector and it makes sense you know you're you're basically hiring the experts to run your utility and looking to deploy best practices you know especially with the trend towards decarbonization generally in the country universities are sort of leading that trend and so you know Iowa case in point you know has coal-fired generation and one of the big features of the deal was getting Iowa off coal within five years and I think a lot of other universities will have the same interest and you can get from a coal-fired plant to burning you know renewables and other sources that that don't pollute much in a much quicker way if you do a deal with the private sector because they've been doing this for years they've got the technical expertise to do it and are really the leaders in innovation so I think there will be more of these transactions in addition to the ones that have been announced so you you know University of Idaho for example has announced a transaction we hear that Fresno State potentially is coming out to market with with with a process fairly shortly there is Dartmouth University which announced some time ago so you know the current pipeline looks promising but look at the other universities I mean you know the Big Ten is an extremely competitive set of universities at a lot of levels and I think that's going to translate also into the way that they handle their infrastructure so now that Ohio State has done a deal now that Iowa has done a deal how much further can Wisconsin Michigan University of Illinois you know be behind them so I've got a lot of optimism about about that sector and I think there's going to be a lot of deal flow I think what's interesting is going to be you know sort of the the level of appetite getting to the point where the the returns are pushed down to a level that may not be be interesting so there might be a little bit of tension like with anything that's publicly tendered in the public sector cost of capital is a concern and you know what I hope is that it and I don't think it's gone that way yet but what I hope is that it doesn't go to the point where these deals become sort of a cost of capital shootout and there isn't as much attention paid you know to the technical solutions and the innovation that's being provided by the private sector as they go into these transactions I guess we we haven't talked about this too but there's also that asset recycling element to it too with the upfront payment feature which seems like a tremendous potential tool for any university when you're able to structure something like that well well right and so in going back to the point I started with you know balance sheet management you know universities I think are all looking for ways to repay debt to be less reliant on their own borrowings to build infrastructure and to maintain infrastructure you can accomplish that while at the same time raising money up front that can be deployed for the university's core mission so it makes sense on a lot of levels you know it's one of those win-win type of sectors where the sell side gets what it's looking for it's a great sector for private capital to be deployed in because distributed generation has you know for a number of years now been you know essentially a private sector activity so it's a great confluence of you know being able to do what the private sector does best invest provide innovation and enable the universities to do what they do best which is educate and do research can I just ask one more question on the Ohio State thing project excuse me has there been any has that gone functional yet you know yes so again I I was involved in that transaction our firm was and I I have to be you know obviously circumspect about what I can say but yes the transaction you know closed there was a transition to the NG Axiom team and the utility has been operating now for you know for some time okay and and by all accounts you know it's it's been successful you know OSU is getting you know what it expected out of it and you know equally the private sector is it well is as well and I think you know another important component of this is the partnership aspect of it you know everybody in our industry tends to focus on the financial elements of these transactions you know what did somebody pay what are they going to earn on the capital they invest but looking at Ohio State in Iowa in particular there are components to the winning bids which actually contribute to the economic to the educational mission so in the case of Ohio State there is an academy that is being established where students at Ohio State can basically attend clinical type classes with with the NG Axiom team and and learn how a utility is run and how a distributed generation business works you know as part of an adjunct to what the university offers on the academic side there's a similar thing happening at Ohio State so you know in addition to raising money repaying debt getting your balance sheet in order refocusing on core activities you also provide something to I think the student the student body in terms of educational opportunities you know you have companies like NG you know Veolia etc who have great R&D great innovation and it's an opportunity for the private sector to share that R&D innovation with with university students and I think that's another sort of unsung aspect of these transactions so you bring up the Ohio State deal and before they did the utility p3 they had done a parking p3 and those are also a lot of the a lot of the goals you mentioned in terms of getting an upfront payment and focusing on the core educational educational aspects we've seen a little bit less of those as the focus has shifted to the utility space and I'm curious whether you think that all the interest in the utility in these utility transactions could generate interest in other in other areas on the campus that that the university might see as non core to its educational mission and where private sector dollars might be interested I do you know the again on OSU you know we represented the winning bidder on that deal to OSU parking so just with respect to what is what is public I think the drivers for that deal are very similar to the drivers for the utility type deals and I am somewhat surprised there haven't been more university parking deals that have come to market following Ohio State I can't think of any reason why they shouldn't not really any structural impediments to it and you know there is a template that has been used successfully so I think there will be more and you know just offering a theory about why we haven't seen as many I think areas like housing for example and utilities are just higher up the priority list for the universities that are looking to do these deals and although you know these universities have you know big functions and can handle a lot of things at the same time these deals are complicated and they're time-consuming processes to to run and in in my view I think it's really a case of prioritization you know if you're looking to do what one of these monetization deals can do you then look at the assets that you have that you think you can raise the most money with which will be most immediately executable and and I think utilities and housing sort of come at the top of the list the other element of parking which I don't think should serve as an impediment but does you know potentially raise concerns and and and questions is the effect it has on rates because you know in a university parking deal the revenue stream is provided by students and faculty and visitors to the university actually paying the rates and I think there is concern I think you know often unfounded concerns that if you do a concession deal for parking that will translate into higher rates and potentially uncontrollably higher rates that's a misconception you know in the case of OSU and I think any parking deal that would get done there's rate regulation in the concession agreement itself and so at the time the deal is approved the Board of Regents or whatever governing body is going to be responsible for for authorizing the deal will have visibility on the maximum amount that rates can go to and so in terms of communicating the impact on rates to the stakeholders and in particular the people who are going to be making the payments everybody knows what they're getting into up front and I think that should dispel the worries about well look the private sector is going to come in and it's going to gouge people and you know before you know it you have a university parking system where parking becomes more expensive and becomes you know sort of an issue in the overall affordability of a university education and that may be one reason why people who haven't really learned enough about how these deals work might be more averse to parking hopefully that could be overcome and I think you know for universities who want to take a deeper dive and understand what it's all about and understand that there will be regulation in your concession agreement if you do a parking deal you know those deals could could make a lot of sense and and I do think there will be more of them but I think in at least in my opinion I think we'll be seeing more on the utility side and then more on the housing side too which itself has been a fairly vibrant market for private investment for a number of years and actually a lot of big deals in the student housing sector predate the Ohio State parking deal Ohio State utilities and Iowa's utility deals so I think that you know housing will continue to be an interesting sector both for universities to seek private investment and for investors themselves to to put money to work. All right well yeah that's definitely an interesting a thing to keep an eye on and I think probably once a few of these deals are in the books maybe people in other universities will get some comfort so something we'll be keeping track of now shifting gears it's been many years now that people have been waiting for the US airport privatization space to really take off so to speak and it's there's been a lot of disappointments I know my home city of White Plains looked at privatizing their airport and it didn't end up happening but now it looks like there is some activity there is some interest and there is maybe a little bit of a pipeline for opportunities will 2020 be the year of airport privatization? I'm not sure about privatization so to back up a little bit at the moment there are basically three ways for private capital to invest in you know the airport sector you know one is you know full-blown privatization under the privatization the federal privatization statute as you mentioned there been you know very few deals done in fact really just one real privatization in in Puerto Rico one very high-profile failed privatization Chicago Midway and then a few airports have you know flirted with the idea with you know essentially two active deals that I'm aware of at the moment one being St. Louis and the other being the Airglades transaction in southern Florida where our firm is involved representing the sponsors so there is some deal flow on the privatization side I think the reason why there hasn't been as much probably as all airports aren't created equal and sometimes there's a mismatch on expectations about you know the value you can get from privatizing your airport and the buy sides expectation about you know exactly what the what the asset is worth so privatizations in some regions you know ie in regions where there's a proven traffic story for the airport and in areas where there are innovative transactions being done where there is a need an unmet need that you know hasn't been met by a public airport and I think the Airglades transaction is a great example of that but I think those transactions will be actually far and few between then the second area of of investment opportunity in the airport space which are the terminal code deals and you know prominent examples of that are here in our backyard in New York with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's deals at LaGuardia Airport where the central terminal is being redeveloped by a private consortium JFK redevelopment under Governor Cuomo's vision plan you know currently has three major redevelopments underway there's the southern quadrant terminal one which our firm is involved in there's the northern quadrant which is led by a JetBlue sponsored consortium and then there's terminal a which is being redeveloped by BA and American Airlines and those transactions I think are more interesting and in a way easier than the privatization transactions because a lot of airports have a fairly extensive experience in leasing out land and facilities to airlines who have built and operated terminals and it's not a big step from that experience to going to a structure where you actually bring in a private operator to operate the consortium and the terminal itself becomes you know a multi airline terminal that can service a particular category of airlines so you take the terminal one deal at JFK for example when it's finished it will be a combination of the existing terminal one existing terminal two and the disused what used to be terminal three and which is now a site for Delta hard stands into one big you know nearly two million square foot terminal for international premium traffic at JFK that's an extremely interesting investment opportunity because JFK is a slot-constrained airport it is the main gateway of entry for a lot of international travel I think it's probably the biggest international gateway so as a business extremely interesting on the aeronautical side and then on the non aeronautical side is since it's an international terminal you have very interesting concession opportunities retail food and beverage etc so from a private investors point of view it provides an opportunity to deploy capital make reasonable returns with you know a fairly stable revenue stream in fact a you know a growing revenue stream just based on the the forecast traffic growth for the entire airport in the region's GDP those deals are not regulated by the FAA so you don't need to go to the FAA to get an approval to do the transaction unlike the privatization deals where you know once you do a deal with the airport you then need to go to the FAA you have to apply for an approval the FAA takes you know a four to six month period of time to review the application and then you get your approval plus you need the approval of the airlines or a percentage of the airlines that call at the airport so you've got governmental approvals to worry about at the federal level and then you have on the airline side you know a very big voice by the airlines and whether the deal can go forward or not whereas in the terminal co type structure you don't need to go to the FAA for approval other than construction approvals for the environmental impact assessment that would be necessary for the construction and your relationship with the airlines is basically a commercial relationship where you're negotiating the terms of use agreements and it's really you know set by the market rather than you know any type of economic regulation I think the the precedents that have been set and the templates that are being developed by the Port Authority deals you know are very deployable to other airports in terms of looking at the privatizations that when we look beyond the Gateway City you know it's been sparse to your point right we've heard some rumors about Ontario Burbank in California and it's kind of been it they you know they just mentioned Midway I'm like why are you mentioned Midway to me again and the Chicago would be out of its mind if they wanted to re-explore that for the third time but well I'm not sure they would be but I think it's such a patchy track record yeah that's what I'm getting at yeah right but but just getting to the terminal idea have you heard any interest from other airports sort of eyeing this I know Miami has been putting a lot of dollars into modernizing the airport for instance not in the same manner as we're doing with JFK but have you heard any other airports show interest in the what's going on with Port Authority projects yeah definitely you know and I think the interest really is going to be at you know the major hub airports that are slot constrained and I'm slightly reluctant to name names because you know there are some processes going on now Miami-Dade case in point you know there's potential there Orlando you know there's been talk at San Diego yeah so I mean really to assess where the need is you just need to you know take a flight to one of those terminals look at the state of the facilities you know determine well gosh you know this is a pretty cruddy facility you know they're going to have to do something about it and now that there is a private sector solution that has been proven I think it's going to prove you know pretty interesting if not irresistible to some airport authorities that don't want to issue more debt you know don't want to continue to put pressure on public sector resources when you have private capital and private operators who are willing to come in and to operate the assets themselves and take the risk of operating the business you know actually relieving the airport from capital expenditure relieving the airport from O&M and at the same time acting as a commercial interface between the airlines and and the airport in negotiating rates and charges to to call at the terminal okay one more question I think that's all the time we'll have but I'm just curious from your point of view because I think what we hear a lot too about impediments is the attitude of the actual airport authorities saying well we're giving up control you know how can we do this it's a political process have you found that attitudes you know through the vise of Port Authority striking a lease with the city and getting these airport deals off the ground that that attitudes have changed somewhat and talking to other sort of authorities out there yeah well well they have and you know we don't hear so much about losing control because these deals are contractually based the authority or the airport you know does retain supervision access you know contractual risk and revenue sharing and so it's not as if they're just handing over the asset and walking away from it you know they they still will be enforcing provisions of the lease to ensure that service levels are met to ensure that you know laws are being complied with and environmental standards are being met so I think it's really less about concerns over control I think you know part of it is just learning more about how it can be done it's early days and there haven't been that many deals you know so getting the word out there where people will know it and I think importantly and I've really have seen this in the Port Authority deals is creating a lease structure that provides alignment between the airport and the investors the operators and the airlines you know so for example and by contrast to the privatization deals rather than a big upfront payment in a typical terminal code deal you know there will be a revenue sharing arrangement where the the private operator will share a percentage of non aeronautical revenues with the airport will share a portion of aeronautical revenues with the airport on a percentage basis so the airport has a vested interest in the success of the terminal co business because if they succeed the airport receives receives revenues and so that's what I think the Port Authority deals have been been very good about doing and the investors in those deals have been very good about doing is ensuring that we have that alignment between what the airport's looking to do which is provide the best customer experience and the best experience in terms of representing what their city is all about for for travelers and and earning money from the deals at the same time. My third category of investment because I think it's another area that is extremely interesting that's ancillary infrastructure on airport so for example Conracks transit deals in the Conrack space you know again we were very you know lucky to have been involved and privileged to you know work with Conrack Solutions, Fengate and the related company on the Newark Airport consolidated rental car facility and it's really the first one that's been done on a private capital project finance type basis but it's it's extremely suitable for private investment because of the way the deals are structured where you have customer facility charges that are added to the the invoices for the users of the rental cars and so there is an identifiable revenue stream albeit demand-based but which can be assessed and priced by the private sector and I think is going to provide a lot of opportunity for investment including in the near term in 2020 where I think there will be Conrack transactions elsewhere around the country following the Newark example. Great well Kent we've spanned the globe here or the country at least so I thank you so much for your time and please tune in next time for the 2020 version of the Crossroads podcast anyway thanks again Brook out. Thank you.

I'm John Burke, America's editor for information. Joining me today is Brent Tusugi, principal at AMP Capital. Brent, thanks for joining the program today. Happy to be here. AMP Capital is a global infrastructure asset manager, which sits upon $12 billion in AUM across its different equity platforms for infrastructure. Brent, we come across a very busy 2019, which could certainly roll over into 2020 at this rate with the way funds are being raised. Why don't you talk about where you see the most opportunity for today in terms of infrastructure investing, in particular looking at which sectors are really going to get a lot of attention as we roll forward to 2020? Yeah. Well, look, I think it's a great question and one that I think a lot of my colleagues and my peers and others in the industry kind of spend a lot of time thinking about. I think given what we've seen in the market, both just in terms of the amount of capital that's raised as well as kind of a new entrance into North America, I think it's caused a lot of us to focus a lot on asset selection and a lot around value creation. But I guess taking a step back and thinking about origination and kind of those sectors that we're particularly interested in right now, I think it's not totally surprising to think that we're probably taking more of a defensive approach to asset selection, really focusing on those sectors that probably have a bit more defensive moats around them, ones that typically have acyclical characteristics. And so I think specifically an area that we are focused on is the digital space. I think that the proliferation of devices, of data, and I'd say certainly the amount of underinvestment in those areas are leading to quite a bit of investment opportunity. And I think the market's awoken to the digital space. And what used to be, I think, an area that kind of felt a bit fringy now is very much mainstream. And so I think whereas a couple of years ago that was probably a bit less competitive in that sector, we're starting to see a lot more interest and a lot of new players. I think outside of the digital space, and I group data centers, fiber, fiber to the tower, and towers infrastructure kind of within that vertical, I think that area within transportation and logistics that we like is really, I'd say, tied to food and food logistics. And it just comes down to the inelastic qualities of food, the fact that it really is non-discretionary. And so whether it's cold logistics or cold storage, I think when you look at the performance of that subsector kind of over many economic cycles, it's been incredibly resilient. And I think if you look forward to a lot of the secular growth around the space, be it from the increasingly organic preferences and tastes of our mature economy, and in turn, the increased refrigeration needs of those more perishable products, or in the developing world, the increased standards of living, consumer power, or leading people to embrace kind of more Western, non-grain-based diets, and hence the need for more development of that infrastructure. I think that's another area that we are pretty keen on. Very interesting stuff, Brent. Thanks for that. Let's start talking about the fundraising environment, and maybe we'll get back to some of these sectors again towards the end of the program. In our fundraising report that we put out, we uncovered that $41.9 billion has been raised from 24 funds over the first three quarters of the year, a drop-off from $57.5 billion raised by 35 funds year over year. However, that stat is completely misleading in the sense that we should end the year on a pretty big high because you have Brookfield and GIP, global infrastructure partners, rounding third base, past third base, on the way to raising two massive $22 billion funds. Brent, in your view, how are asset managers today creating differentiation? Is it more the case of specialization? Is it more the case of looking at different industries, such as how Digital Colony and GI Partners is approaching their round of funds with respect to digital? What's your view on these things? As a starting point, I'd say that the proliferation of options and alternatives for institutional investors is – I think people would bemoan how much capital is in there, but I think when you compare how much dry powder is available in infrastructure to other private markets endeavors, there's still quite a bit more to go. And I think that the opportunity set is still big enough for all of us to do well and find interesting opportunities and deploy capital. I also think that as the range of alternatives have grown, it's probably broadened the overall appeal of the asset class. It has enabled institutional investors to create a portfolio of diversified exposure by perhaps buying a global manager, a large-cap global manager here, or augmenting it with a small-cap North American fund or a specialized digital partner. And I think that as that takes root and as infrastructure becomes even more ever-present in the minds of our institutional investors, it'll only be good things for all of us as managers. I think your question around how do you stand out in a crowd is one that I think a lot of entrants, both new and established, are evaluating. And what I would say is specialization, I felt, held quite a bit of promise early in this evolution, where you had generalist managers who kind of spread the gamut, and I think specialization came into play as a potential differentiator, and people started hiring or funds started hiring individuals with a lot of subject matter expertise. I think that that wave has not completely played out, but I think a lot of the differentiation on that point is the value of that differentiation is really starting to wane. And it's just because I think everybody sees that in order to deliver consistent value and above-average returns, I think you need to understand sectors at a much more fundamental level, and that's something that I think generalist managers really struggle with. Being able to identify when you've got a handful of parties chasing after the same asset in a broadly marketed auction, cost of capital and differentiation of cost of capital is nil. Subject matter expertise helps in really identifying those additional value creation levers that are going to help get you to that above-average return threshold. And so I think people recognizing that have built their teams with that subject matter expertise in mind and that specialization in mind. I guess if I think about where we're headed, and I think I draw a lot of cues from private equity as a general asset class. You look at how that segment and asset class has evolved really over the last 30-ish years. It was not dissimilar from what we're living to today, but I think what the private equity space has embraced for a while now is really post-acquisition value creation and operating executive talent. I think the managers that started that adoption process, like GIP to name one, for example, I think started the wave, but I think that's where a lot of managers now are headed. And so I think that's what I anticipate seeing more of in the future, which is not only having a fund with sector specialization and investment professionals that come from either operating roles or spending a lot of time in industry, but increasingly growing ranks of operational talent. They may be formalized or that might be adjunct in advisory, but that's where I see differentiation heading. Interesting. And then another part about this has been the convergence with the Terminal and B market, which has been, again, I don't have the leverage loan volumes for Holdco for infrastructure-related buyouts, but there's been multiple more this year and last year relative to previous years. And each one's created sort of a unique test. And what happened in this quarter was two very big deals pricing and pricing really well. This being the $2.55 billion loan underwriting or backing, sorry, Brookfield's buyout of Genesee and Wyoming, the global railroad operator. And IFM doing a 2.2, sorry, doing a buyout of Buckeye Partners, that loan backed by a $2.25 billion loan. Both loans rated in the BA range, BB range. Both loans pricing tighter of expectations. And Buckeye Partners, again, got such a strong reception that the bond offering got scrapped and they were able to upsize the bank loan to its current level. And both loans overall priced inside of L plus three on the margin. So really strong performances in the syndicated market. Probably goes back to your point about defensive investments really pricing strongly here. But what's your view on the left loan market and how infrastructure funds think about pricing these deals? I mean, these were obviously very much at the higher end of the sector and they priced really well. So that could be a good harbinger of some other deals. Or the question is, is there enough deals that are going to fit that remit too? So anyway, putting a couple of jumbled questions out there. But what are your thoughts on this latest trend? No, look, I think it speaks to increasing focus and concentration on quality assets. And I think good credits given where we are in the overall economic cycle and leverage cycle. I'm not surprised to see oversubscription and tightening of terms for kind of larger opportunities with stronger teams that are defensive. Look, both of the deals that I think you mentioned have different secular fundamentals. ZAO, as we chatted about, I think is a great example of an asset, a company with a very strong team, phenomenal track record of acquisitive growth. That has many more innings left in it. And it's going to be keyed off of kind of the overall underinvestment in kind of the digital space. And I think Genesee Opportunity, similarly, it's a team that has demonstrated a great set of experiences in delivering more alpha in kind of an overall sleepy kind of asset sector. I think there's a lot of fundamentals and trends that I think will benefit Genesee going forward. I think precision railroading being primary and having a large platform of scale with a strong financial backer and strong capital structure I think is only going to mean that there's probably going to be more opportunity for that asset to outperform. So I don't think size alone, because both examples here are significant, I don't think size alone is the biggest contributing factor to financial success or really having an oversubscribed opportunity. I think it's just more, do you have the right team? Are you well-timed in the cycle? And what's your story and what's your point of differentiation? Yeah, and to your point on Zio, it is going to be a much bigger test in the market, which again, we're expecting by the end of the year, but it's supposed to be $5.9 billion in net debt hitting the market. Goldman and JP Morgan are the arrangers. This is, of course, the back digital colony and EQT infrastructures buyout of Zio. Zio, excuse me, is obviously a global fiber operator with a lot of strong concentration in the US of fiber assets. And that leads us into my next question about technology and how it's going to dictate the way you guys invest moving forward. Obviously, the demand for data and connectivity is what's driving all this, the limitless demand. But beneath that, obviously, there are defining infrastructure characteristics. Data centers is more pronounced, it's usually around a 10-year term. And you're looking at syncing up with the Googles and Microsofts of the world that are trying to expand their data footprint, which expands every second we talk here, Brent. And then connectivity or fiber also continues to be in demand as well as what we've seen by these deals. But there's a lot of these deals that have already taken place already across the digital spectrum. Where do you think it's going to go next? I mean, do you think there's going to be more roll up of fiber companies? Do you think there's newer technologies that are going to become part of this? I know Edge Data Center has been talked about as a bigger growth model story because of how they're just smaller, more nimble or closer to the customer. What are some of your thoughts around this? The reason I think our strategy has a lot of thematic conviction here is I think that, as you said, John, the creation of data is happening at such a rapid clip. I forget what the statistic is, but I think over 70 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute of every day. And I think the customer preference and the customer experience now has changed so dramatically. I mean, I remember when we were at the early development of the Internet and I think you had a 56 or 28k modem and dialing up was something you were willing to do. I think latency right now and the attention span of users and the requirements for on-demand everything, I think, have changed the need for more co-location and likely more computing power closer to where people sit. I think that there's been a massive development and investment in those major metropolitan areas where hyperscale data centers, fibers have been built out. But I think to really power the digital infrastructure of the future, whether that's 5G, which is going to need more distributed antenna systems and more computing power, or whether that's on the edge, to really enable IoT and autonomous vehicles where if you really want to power a vehicle autonomously, you can't have any latency. There can't be any delay. So increasingly, you're going to have to really build more of a backbone in those tier two, tier three cities. I think that's kind of the next wave of where I see meaningful amounts of further consolidation and reinvestment. And I think when you look at some of the things that we've been focused on, some of the assets that we've acquired, I think it's really kind of with that in mind. We really want to get to the forefront here before the market, A, becomes too crowded and B, before the major consolidators in the space really kind of awaken to the prospect and really start spending a lot of money and time kind of getting their fingers deeper into kind of some of these other markets. Yeah, there's obviously that competition out there where you see the Googles and Microsofts of the world just going directly to cities. And, you know, you're the comptroller and Google's calling you up, you know, sure, you'll take that call any day of the week. So that's always out there. We've seen a couple of those initiatives. Also, Brent, obviously on the PPP front, you've seen a couple of state initiatives out there to get rural broadband out there as like a major need, you know, which we've seen sort of take place solely over the Kentucky Wired project. But there's been some other initiatives behind that as well in Pennsylvania and Georgia, I guess, as it's been out there and in North Carolina. So that's been another sort of facet to this. But obviously, I think some of these state initiatives are probably moving a little bit slower than where you guys are on one tier and then Google and Microsoft are on another tier in terms of getting these capabilities up to snuff. In any case, I think I just wanted to sort of close out talking about macro trends. You know, what do you think is going to be really the big things that we should be looking forward to in 2020? This is, sorry, I'm using looking forward to loosely in quotes. Obviously, there's fears about recession and job growth slowing and all that kind of stuff. We have a presidential election to deal with next year as well, which has already started to take place if you watch CNN 24 hours a day. What's your thoughts on the macro environment for 2020? I think that what I hope happens is that a lot of the noise that surrounded 19 gets resolved. And so noise around Brexit, noise around Asia and what's happening in Hong Kong. You know, firming up our trade arrangements with our allies, I think, is going to bring a much needed visibility to the market and hopefully more business investment, which I think will benefit a lot of segments that we focus on. You know, look, I would say that there's significant, not significant, but I'd say that there's a fair amount of risk overhanging everything right now. And I think the forms it'll take is one is just an overall correction. You know, when you look at historic levers that the government has used to stave off corrections and recessions, you know, we're out there using them right now. Whether that's rate cuts or tax abatements, it's not a whole lot left in the gun. So what the catalyst might be that causes one, I think that's what I'm looking to on the horizon. But I'm hoping that we stop self-inflicting a lot of the damage and really start putting some of these open items really to bed. I think interest rate risk is something longer term that I think we spend some time thinking about in terms of portfolio construction, but also just the return environment. And this isn't a 2020 perspective. This is probably a three to five-year horizon perspective. But I think asset valuations have been bolstered by just an incredibly cheap environment. And when you have negative rates in a lot of geographies or near zero rates in a lot of geographies, it causes, I think, behavior that I query if it would exist if we were in a more stabilized, normalized rate environment. And so that's something I think we will have to watch. And that's not infrastructure specific. I think that's across all asset classes. And how that reverberates through to consumer credit and consumption, that's something I think we're going to be watching. And I think the last thing is just around armed conflict. I think that the likelihood of that is probably low. But look, 2020, given its importance in terms of the reelection, and you look at levers that have been pulled in the past to create, I'd say, more support around an incumbent. There's just things I think that, given how important getting reelected is, not only to this president, but to all presidents, I think that it just sometimes leads to behavior that creates uncertainty. So I think that we're going to have to watch and see what happens here. Terrific. Brent, thank you so much for coming on the program today. Thanks for tuning in to the listeners out there. And we will see you for the December edition of the podcast, Berkout.

Welcome to the November edition of the Crossroads Podcast. Joining me today is Brent Suzuki, Principal of AMP Capital. Brent, welcome to the program. Thanks for having me. Thank you. AMP's infrastructure equity platform sits on top of about $12 billion in AUM, investing in all areas of infrastructure investing. So me and Brent are here to talk about what the environment looks like for 2020 as we near the end of the fourth quarter and some robust loans perhaps being the foreshadowing of better things to come in this space, but we'll get to that in a little bit. But we're going to kick off talking about where the opportunity lies for infrastructure equity funds in 2020 in terms of newer investment opportunities as well as some core investing opportunities that might be around the corner as well. So Brent, with that I'll let you take it away. Well, it's great to be here with you. It's the amount of money that's in the market now I think is dwarfed by the amount of dry powder corporate private equity market. But I think it's made all of us, all of the GPs on our side, think a little bit harder, a little bit more creatively about where we kind of do the flow. The typical, you know, vanilla power plant or, you know, core growth port is just being pitted down to levels that I think we really haven't seen historically and really without precedent. And we'll, I'm sure we'll get into this later in the discussion, but it'll be curious to see how many of these investments fare. And I think there are probably a fair number of parallels to the investment environment today of what we saw back in 2007 and 2008. I know many might not love when I say that, but I think that's probably the reality. You know, given where we are, not only with this proliferation of dry powder, but also where we are in the broad economic cycle, you know, our strategy is really focused on those more defensive areas of intra that are somewhat asyclical or that have shown tremendous resiliency through past cycles. So transportation is a pretty big area of focus and strength for the firm. So there's a handful of subsectors within transportation that we like. Digital is a very big area that we see tremendous amounts of opportunity. Who's got macro and sector effects that are going to continue to support us regardless of whether or not we enter into a correctional and broader recession. So at a high level, you know, I think that there's still an abundance of, I'd say, adjacent spaces that make a lot of sense that aren't too frontierish for us to be looking. But look, there are going to be folks that given the proliferation and given the return on investment are going to get a little bit more creative in terms of their definition. And I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of opportunities and deals that get announced over the coming year that I think will really kind of stretch the imagination of LPs and maybe potentially the press. Excellent. So expanding on that definition of infrastructure and infrastructure funds, we just put out our fundraising report yesterday on Information News that we are, the piece is actually sold down in 2019, but that's sort of a misnomer. We got 41.9 billion raised through 24 funds over the first three months, nine months of the year, relative to 57.5 billion raised by 35 funds during the same period a year ago. But of course, the agent for guerrilla in the room hasn't closed yet. And that is both the 22 billion dollar funds being raised by GFP and Brookfield's fourth quarter, first quarters, the forecast, you know, whatever happens and happens and that'll skewer the 2019 totals quite nicely. And then behind that is whatever Blackstone raises by the end of the year, which is an open-ended fund. And they are currently targeting plenty of money. And I'll just leave it at that. But within the trend, we discovered a couple interesting things in terms of specialization apparently for the launch, the growth funds to support technology. We've also come across a couple tech-oriented funds as well in the infrastructure definition, such as Digital Colony, I guess, is an example of it. So there's definitely specialization that's coming in, I guess, in terms of differentiation. How do you view that trend? I think it's a great thing for the market. You know, what it's afforded is really a broad menu of options for investors, people that invest in those types of funds. To really match their own liabilities with a potential fund strategy. And I think that it's a great development for the market because I think it only broadens the appeal of infra for an ever-growing field of investors, which is only going to be good things for us. You know, what I do think it's caused, however, is maybe a misinterpretation of how you derive alpha and how you find return. And specialization for specialization's sake is fine. I think even in those areas, so if you're a Digital Colony or a G.I. Partners and you're raising a digital fund and you've got incredible amounts of industry specialization and knowledge and a really deep bench of people in the middle space inside and out, I think that affords you an opportunity to find an earth, maybe flow and opportunities that wouldn't come to a general opportunity. And I also think that in this age with how advanced and really efficient the market is, I think if you are mid-market or even, you know, small cap opportunity, I think more often times than not you're going to, unless it's a really strong relationship, I think you're going to tend to find there's going to be a number of people calling on your door and about you. And I think the market has gotten so efficient that as much as we like to say we find bilateral field flow, I think most of these opportunities are usually amongst the coverage individuals. So increasingly, I think specialization is helpful, but I think where the market needs to go to and where it's evolving is embracing strategies post-acquisition, value creation initiatives to really unlock alpha. And that's in my mind where I think the industry is still pretty decent. A lot of private equity strategies or private equity managers, you know, GPs that have historic expertise in private equity have a deep bench and experience in this. And so they've got teams of people that are focused on sourcing, strategic sourcing and teams of folks that are former operators that will identify these dislocations in your cost structure. And I think a lot of the infraspace that wasn't born out of private equity started to catch on that this is something that they ought to embrace, partly because it's just being specialized is not going to give you a leg up in delivering consistent returns, just because everybody is specialized at this point. Even if you aren't a dedicated fund of digital, if you're a Blackstone, if you're KKR, if you're us, you'll have an investment professional that has been there, that has spent meaningful amounts of time in the space. And so having a dedicated pool isn't really advancing the GPU per se in finding the opportunities, which I think has been historic, you know, around why specialization makes sense. Interesting. So you're kind of saying that, you know, rather than telegraphing to the market, or which in this case is limited partners, et cetera, et cetera, about a particular strategy, you go in as saying we're an infrastructure fund. We buy a company and we build a strategy around it. And that's where you're going to find your most consistent returns. There's a real asset or an operating company with assets that's interlinked collateral. What I would say is I think open-ended structures are well suited for certain assets. And close-ended structures that have a finite period of time to realize value creation are better for others. And it kind of depends on where you are in the economic cycle when you're making the investment, how long that cycle typically takes to turn, and whether or not you're taking a Deuterian bet aggregating scale during the contraction if it's a cyclical investment, or if you're really looking to kind of buy things once they've achieved scale and then looking to tease out cost efficiencies. It's not a one-size-fits-all type of model. And I think the challenge is really knowing who you are if you're an open-ended structure and you're like a blackstone and you've got scale. It's targeting those investments that are well suited for your netting. If you are a mid-market fund that's closed-end, it's finding those opportunities where, from a cycle standpoint, the right time to enter. And from a horizon standpoint, really kind of making sure that the asset selection process is a very deliberate process. And I think when I look back at past vintages, past GPs, I think that a lot of the trouble has come in situations where this asset wasn't well aligned with the overarching strategy. And I'm not saying they were a North American-focused vehicle and they wanted a global asset. I'm saying they were three years into their investment period and they had a couple of years left, and it was an asset aggregation plan and they had two years to do it. And they were mistimed in the cycle. Or they bought at a cyclical high and over-remembered. And when the correction took place, everyone's seen how that story played out. So I think that as a result, specialization, more active asset management, in my mind, have led all GPs that embrace that to find better deals, to be more disciplined when they're buying them, and then more importantly, once they do acquire them, actually deliver sustainable value creation, which I think will benefit us as an asset class because it'll just mean that returns from all of these vintages, whether you're a $22 billion vehicle or a $2.5 billion vehicle or a $500 million vehicle, it will likely be more sustainable returns. And ideally, as an asset class, position us vis-a-vis other private markets or public markets outfits as being kind of a really preferred place for institutions to work. Let's harp on that a little bit more. We've had a very active month in the leopard load markets for these infrastructure-related buyouts. Genesee in Wyoming, I am waiting for official confirmation that the deal closed, but terms under Term 1B, the $2.55 billion Term 1B, did tighten yesterday and commitments were due yesterday, that being November 6th, usually a good sign that it's going to close and allocate. They were able to tighten pricing to all plus two, which is a slight OID, and that comes on the heels of either about two weeks ago, IFM investors able to close out its buyout of Buckeye. No, it was a week ago, excuse me, close out its buyout of Buckeye Partners. They went to the market with a $2.25 billion Term 1B and pricing tightened up to all plus 275 bps. They were able to upsize it because they were contemplating a bond deal originally. They were both rated double B on S&P, which is obviously a good sweet spot for CLOs, home run deals for credit suites and in fairly defensive markets there within midstream and railroad. Sounds like some pretty favorable signs for these bigger deals. Obviously, Zio is on the horizon too, probably coming up sooner rather than later. I took that Reuters story the other day. It's like a sign that, oh, it's probably going to launch next week. Oh, it's at the end of the year. Maybe sooner. What does it say for these larger infrastructure fund buyouts? Are these defensive investments really playing well in the Term 1B market? It's asking a fairly rhetorical question, I think, but obviously, there's always those fears of recession. The Walgreens News probably spoke to more than a few people, I'm sure, about this being top of the market economics, but what's your thought about these loans and whether you consider this like a harbinger for some of these other deals to get executed the rest of the year into the next year? I think paying anything with one word first probably doesn't make a difference. It's so asset-specific and situation-specific. We're not getting into details about it at other companies. Zio, I think the scale affords it with unique advantages. Obviously, we're a big believer. Our strategy is a big believer in digital and the digital strategy for a lot of macro factors. I think Zio is one of the largest providers of fiber services. I think it's going to benefit from not only the proliferation of smart devices, the creation of massive amounts of exabytes of data, but also increasingly the need for more connectivity. I think it's a defensive play. Size matters less. I think if you are, and I can't speak for CFOs, but I would presume that you like the credit because you believe in the broader equity story. Equity story has legs because it's defensive and it's really genesis of a whole other ball of wax where I think that transportation assets, generally speaking, are early cycle leaders and late cycle. If you are a broad field, what you're, I would presume, likely anticipating is opportunities for efficiency gains from looking at the operations of the business, but more importantly, probably looking at all of the trouble that the class ones are going through right now. Some estimate that they're going through their own recession in a way. You look at car loads, car volumes, and the meaning playoff for a lot of reasons. One of the ways that many of them have embraced to create an erase model is by doing shared pipettes or more readily embracing a precision railroad, which is kind of this amorphous term, but really what it is is just really looking at asset utilization and maximizing asset utilization for assets that are done, or really kind of revisiting should we hold them up if we're not utilizing them. So I think what it's led to, and a couple of networks have really wanted to charge this, is looking at their constellation of railroad assets and saying, we need a model for this. It's not dissimilar from de-industrialization, which indeed, that happened in the 80s amongst many U.S. and European conglomerates and that's what led to the boom in private equity, which is, we don't need it only because it's probably better in our hands. And so the class ones are going to likely, and have started to do this, spin off in several lines, another cool piece of the track. And if you're a Genesee and you've got a well depocketed investor and you've got fantastic scale, you can bring these into the fold and you create a long-standing society. And so you combine that thesis with where we are on the cycle. If you're a Genesee and you're buying these assets off of arguably very low productivity, and then you ride it through, your entry point is very attractive. And if you ride it through a cycle of upturn, it's only going to be the whole enterprise, much more meaningful. So I don't know if that would be necessarily the thesis that the investors see through, I think it's more, you've got a very accomplished sponsor that's backing a deal with a market leader that has fantastic margins. But if I'm an equity investor or a co-investor in that deal, it's a defensive asset because of its scale, but it also has a really attractive set of prospects on the back end. Just moving on to the legislative environment front. I mean, obviously there was a lot of noise around President Trump's federal infrastructure initiatives. From a couple of years back, there was an architect, Mr. E. J. Griffin, who's no longer in the administration. There was a bill that was geared around backstopping federal projects, backstopping these projects 20% from the Fed. And then that bill didn't go anywhere. Probably once he got his tax breaks in place, it was sort of like Congress saying, well, we give you the tax breaks and that's how you're going to get this go around. So while that quashed any hopes of a federal infrastructure bill, it certainly hasn't stopped states from trying to tap the P3 market from getting projects done. I could definitely point the finger at LA. I'm not going to point at California, I'm going to point at LA. They got massive projects done last year at the airport. They got their parking garage done. They got their people movers project done, multi-billion dollar projects with equity investors and contractors all aligned in the city's vision to get modern projects in place ahead of the Olympia. And it's continued already with Proposition N to get the subway expanded in LA. Again, it sounds like they have the support of the municipal governments. Obviously building a railroad through LA is not an easy proposition, but they're going through feasibility studies. They want to make this a P3 at some point in the next few years. There's Clear Drive. Elsewhere, you see, obviously, Qualmough trying privatization at the airports. And then that's kind of the big project, the LA Civic Center. Well, it's LA, there you go. And then the other day, Colorado sort of put out there that there's an unsolicited bid on the table for the C470. But maybe if you could talk through some of your observations now investability in P3s at the state level, what kind of positive or negative developments do you see in the TLEs? Just as a transportation guy, the heartburn, that's why I asked this, that you probably have some soft thoughts around this. Yeah. I think it goes without saying, you walk outside your door as a user of public infrastructure, you see just how grumbling it is in what is here in New York or in Indiana or California. I mean, a trillion dollars of reinvestment is required really just to bring us back up to par, not even to advance the discussion and bring in different ideas or new technologies that the rollover has really embraced. I think we all had, all of us, transportation investors, had a lot of hope that when Trump came in that there was going to be really meaningful unilateral efforts made. And look, I still believe that at some point something will get done. And I think increasingly it will be done at the local level and it will be driven out of urgency and frustration at projects that they have made collectively. Local state governments can't fund on their own or that they find will have other, more productive uses of their state resources and local resources. Unfortunately, however, it's case by case basis. We're a patchwork world of 50 countries, 5,000 cities and countless municipalities. And so it's going to happen. I hate to be the Pollyanna that continues to say this is, I don't know what the catalyst will be, but I think our continued ability to kick the cane down the road in different maintenance is only going to, it's going to catch up with us at some point. And unfortunately, I think it will only be in those situations where the procuring entity of local municipalities is under such duress that they have to embrace it. P3s in many ways are kind of the opportunity last resort. They are the ripcord. And it's unfortunate because it's an opportunity loss. We look at the world over and how P3s have been embraced to progress the discussion and improve infrastructure, not just contain it. I don't believe that it will change, but I think that the question is when. And if you are a manager and you're waiting for the tide to turn, waiting for the catalyst, and in this business, unless you're an open-ended manager that has infinite amounts, I think you have a desire to capitalize on opportunities that come and to deploy capital. Yeah, we're obviously seeing today the concept of the contractor equity investor is just disappearing entirely, to your point, because there are so publicly traded contractors slash equity investors that are now showing to their investors a huge loss from P3s from not enough projects and then taking losses in certain aspects of these projects. And so you've seen a pretty good subsection of guys just retreat. Yeah, I mean if you think about just asset utilization, it can be capital utilization. If you're an architecture or an engineering firm or a contractor and you build that whole team, largely on the premise that Trump was going to create this windfall of opportunity and it never materialized, you're carrying a lot of overhead without a lot of things to do. And similarly, if you look at what happened in the investment banking industry, there were a lot of dedicated inferred groups or P3 groups, and now a lot of that resident knowledge has kind of been spread out across these institutions. I still believe it will come and it will come and it will be meaningful. I think that the preponderance of international investors entering the internal market, setting up local teams only, I think, bellies the promise of what will be. Because, look, I think of all of the large OECD countries out there, probably one of the biggest developing opportunities. And so, yeah, I think that it will come, but I think you have to find ways to fill your time in the interim. And if you're just a P3 dedicated strategy, I think it's really challenging. Sure. And there's just so many X factors we've learned over time. If you're building a subway, you can't just enter the market. That's not going to work. These are massive capital intensive projects. You need to know what you're doing and have some sort of track record behind it. I know we've written before about Canada encouraging diversity, but I think you're just telegraphing to the equity investors like, look, well, there's a few guys that we see at every process. You can go to the province and find a contractor there and at least align the interests with a local contractor to say that the economy is really benefiting from that kind of initiative. But that has been telegraphed at points in the Canadian P3 process. Anyway, Brent, I wanted to thank you for coming on today's program. Thank you. I hope I will talk to you again. Thanks again.

I'm John Burke, America's Editor of Information. In this program, we aim to deliver you the best in infrastructure information in 30 minutes or less, or we'll deliver you a free pizza. So we have a busy calendar ahead this month and into early November. My birthday is on Saturday to start off with, but that's not why we're here. Coming up next Wednesday and Thursday is our Eves conference emanating from Madrid, Spain this year. It's sort of our European Greenfields conference. It's going to be keynoted by Teresa Flynn of BlackRock Alternative Investments, who's going to talk about sustainability and infrastructure investing. Next on October 22nd is the Merchant Market Mexican M&A Forum, where Jonathan Carmody, who's joining us on today's podcast, is going to talk about renewable investments in Mexico. He'll get to that a little bit later in today's program. And finally, November 6th, which I believe is a Wednesday, is our IIF Latin American Conference, which is our brownfields investing forum for Latin America, to be held at the Convene Conference Center in midtown New York. And that's going to be the topic of today's podcast. Joining me today is Mr. Carmody, the news editor for Latin America. Thanks for joining us as always, Jonathan. Thanks for having me, JB. And Katie Gavala, who covers Greenfields projects for us in Latin America. Thanks for joining the program, Katie. Excited to be here. Great. And so we're going to start off talking about a trend that's emerged in Latin America, and it's going to actually be a topic at the IIF Latin America Conference. This is on highways and roads, and where the opportunity lies. We have a very good panel lined up for that conference. Speakers from Brookfield Asset Management, Bank Chile, and FDN. And today we're going to talk about that trend. So Jonathan, why don't you tell us what's been a real driver, where these deals are going down geographically, and take it from there. Well, I've been with the company for about five years, and highways have always been a staple investment in Latin America. It seems like when you want to develop a PPP program, you often start with highways as a very simple setup. And now a lot of the countries have been doing this for a long time, and these roads are coming to maturity. A lot of the funds have invested for about eight to 10 years in these assets, and they're starting to come to market in the secondary. We were seeing in Chile, Brookfield has sold some of its highways in the last few months. They've sold stakes in the Vespucio Norte and the Tunnel San Cristobal highways to local infrastructure funds, Ban Chile and Frontotrust. And also we've seen French investor Ardian invest in some of the highways, alongside the new fund from CMB and Larrain Vial. So it's exciting to see new players, new investors taking over from old players like Brookfield. Elsewhere in Chile, there are some Greenfield opportunities as well, but those seem to be going a bit slower, don't they, Katie? Yeah, things are pretty delayed in Chile. The only tender process we've seen launch has been for an airport group, two airports. They had a really big pipeline that they released in January, and typically it's a pretty solid market. But for some reason, there have been some serious delays. On the topic of Greenfield, one of the big tenders that everyone is waiting for is the re-tender of Route 5, Talcachillan. This is a pretty big road, $500 million in CapEx. It's a re-tender. So it should be a slam dunk project. Interestingly enough, it's also actually the first contract that Chile is going to structure under a predetermined contract term. So it's going to be for 25 years. Typically in Chile, the way this works is that the concessionaire and the government, they agree upon a rate of return. And then the contract term could vary depending on when that return hits. But the government is saying that in order to make these assets more competitive, they're going to try out this fixed term for 25 years. So that'll be interesting to see. Route 5, Talcachillan. In terms of other activity that we're seeing, honestly, there are very few open tenders right now for road projects, which is kind of strange. But there are two private initiatives in Colombia right now. And the local governments are welcoming third party interests. So these are projects that have been presented by local developers. And now other third parties have the opportunity to come forward and say, we're interested in potentially building these roads. So the first is a road in Antioquia. The grantor is the government of the Department of Antioquia. It's a 13 kilometer road proposed by Con Concreto, as well as a couple of others. So right now there's a period third parties can come forward, say, you know, we're interested in building this road. And see if the government bites. And then the other one is a road in Cartagena that's supposed to facilitate cargo transport to the port of Cartagena. So just create more space to get cargo over to the port. That's being proposed by KMA Construcciones. And again, the period is open for third parties to come forward. These processes tend to not be incredibly competitive in Colombia. Because these are private initiatives that don't require any public resources. These roads are just going to generate income from the tolls. The government isn't actually required to open a full tender process. So what will happen now is if a third party comes forward and says we're interested, they'll get a couple of months to put together a bid. If their bid is better than the original proposer, that original proponent gets the chance to say, well, we can do it for less. And so if no third parties come forward and say they're interested, the projects are going to be immediately awarded to the originators. So interesting opportunities. But in Colombia, 95% of these private initiatives tend to be awarded to the company that originally proposed it. So we'll see what happens. But really, we're waiting for Chile to release this Talco-Chillán tender. Great. Thanks, Katie. Great. You know, one of the other big investors down in highways has always been SACIR from Spain. And they decided to monetize a lot of their assets recently by selling a 49% stake to Tuesca. Tuesca is another one of these upstart funds in Chile. They've been investing in a few highways over the years. They've got some interesting assets as well in water concessions and some electric assets. But it's interesting to see them then take on a large chunk of the responsibility for highways in SACIR's portfolio. We understand they're bidding as well for some minority stakes in a couple of highways, which are owned by the Falabella Group. Anybody who knows Latin America might know Falabella is a fashion and retail conglomerate. They also have a few financial interests as well as other companies in the mix. But they have two companies as part of the family group, which also own 49% stakes in two of these highways, which are co-owned by Tuesca and SACIR. And it looks like it's between Tuesca and DIFF, who are looking to make their first Latin American highway investment, possibly in those highways. Be interesting to see what happens there. And you don't see Walmart owning roads in the US. Just thinking about it. But anyway. My favorite one is Louis Vuitton, which owns a railway in Peru. No. Yeah. LVMH, as they call it. That's their group. They bought a hotel group called Belmont, I think. And Belmont owned this railway, which is a tourist railway to Machu Picchu. So there's a good commercial reason all in, I suppose. Is the trip particularly beautiful? Do we know? I think the trip is particularly beautiful. OK. So at least they've got that going for them. Yeah. Kitty was aiming for scented seats, leather. Exactly. I wanted some leather-branded seats. Sounds like a research trip. Yeah, exactly. Sorry, JB. I have to go to Peru. I think I want to go, too. Just talking through the rest of the conference, some of the highlights. Obviously, we can't have an IFF Latin American forum without Shirley talking about Brazil. We've had a year full of dynamic change that everything we previewed about the Bolsonaro administration sort of started to come true. He asked for large privatization, and the challenge accepted, I suppose. Jonathan, what can you tell us about what we've seen emerge so far from this privatization trend? Well, we saw the airport concessions. They were tendered and won by some of the large European players. We've also seen some movement in terms of the water utilities tendering out projects and looking for privatizations or IPOs. There's a bit of a saga going on at the moment with Igua Sanimiento. Very hard to understand their motivations here, but it looks like they tried to IPO and then they pulled back at the last minute. So we're waiting to see what happens with that situation. Very interesting enough, one of the highways was recently tendered as well. I think it was Eco Rodovias, which won a new highway there. It looks like maybe the Viracopos airport is going to find some kind of resolution soon, as the time's running out for the investors to provide financial solutions. So it's likely going to have to be a sale process that we'll see bids in the coming months for that. Yeah, I mean, obviously, to your point, we've seen plenty of European interest about the airports that come down to Brazil and make runs at some of these airports. Sure, and to put it in context, I think as everybody knows, Brazil has suffered for years with the scandals of Lava Jato and all of the corruption that was involved in that. Many of the large construction companies have been displaced from the market just because they had to rebalance their books. They've had to sell their foreign concessions outside of Brazil and kind of concentrate on their core business within the country. You know, like with Ica in Mexico, when they went through bankruptcy, we saw them kind of refocus on construction. That's their core business. That's what they're good at. The concessions were a bit of a luxury and a bit of a money making mechanism for them. And so for them to go back to doing what they do best and just building, I think that's created this space for European companies to enter the market and display some of them. And also on the capital markets side, you know, hopefully these panels will talk a little bit about the DaVenture market, because it's just working its way into a lot of these situations. I guess we've seen a lot more on sort of these operating companies being able to raise money to refinance Project Finance or expand projects or something along those lines. I mean, that's become a very grown up market all of a sudden. Lots of issuance volume. Towards the end of last year, we saw some of the transmission lines awarded in the competitive tender and companies from all over, including some Indian companies for a change. And a few of those have now been financed with DaVentures. We've seen the issuances and some of the wind farms and some of the renewable technology has also been funded that way too. Yeah. And this comes in this, of course, BNDS saying they were going to pull back from lending. So this is the gap, essentially. Essentially, yeah. I've been hearing that for a long time. So if that's really the case and BNDS is really going to step back and not provide so much financing, then that's a great opportunity for banks everywhere. But I'm still waiting to see that really become the case. Yeah, no, that's very fair. And I don't think some of the debt funds that have risen in the past two to three years necessarily targeting Brazil or specifying Brazil. Latin America, I think, is surely in that conversation. It's just not very specific to Brazil. So we don't know if they're playing down there or not. I think the funds I've talked to before have not necessarily said that's something they're targeting yet. But so far, sorry for that panel. We've got Eduardo Redes from KPMG speaking and more of that to come. The last topic I wanted to talk about real quick is something we'll also be discussing is midstream opportunities. This will also be a topic we'll be discussing at our America's investing conference in February, just because there's obviously been a ton of activity amongst funds in both regions, essentially buying into the midstream, buying into the sanctity of pipeline contracts. I had a meeting with somebody recently who said it best, that a lot of these funds are turning into defensive investments against the looming threat of a global recession if it's coming at some point. But you see midstream being in that category, along with data centers, because that's also a highly defensible measure. Where's the data going? How's that going to eviscerate? But midstream is obviously a completely animal of its own. So with that in mind, maybe explain some of the deals we've seen this year and what's driving that dynamic down in Latin America. Sure. Well, some of the most important deals were Brookfield's entrance into Mexico through the acquisition of BlackRock and First Reserve stakes in the Los Ramones pipeline. This is the Los Ramones 2 North and South pipelines. Brookfield paid, I think it was around $400 million for the stakes. And it was, like I said, their first entrance into Latin America. Well, not to Latin America, but into Mexico. And we've heard their name mentioned with other pipeline deals as well. We've heard they were looking at other assets in the sector. One of the deals that was obviously the most significant for us in a long time has been TAG. We talked about it in the last podcast, I believe, but TAG was a huge deal and really just displayed how attractive these assets can be. It's more of a pipeline network as opposed to a single pipeline. But at the same time, it commanded a huge price and it was a very competitive auction by the sounds of it. One other deal, which is slightly more complex, looks to be Ocensa in Colombia, the Olioducto Central. This pipeline is majority owned by Ecopetrol, which is a Colombian government-backed company. But the minority stake for about 22% is owned by Abvin International, which is a Boston-based private equity firm. Now, they tried to sell it previously. They had offers from iSquared, we believe, from BlackRock and from Renhaus. Unfortunately, that process failed. They went away. They refinanced their stake. I think they omitted some bonds. And they've come back to the market now, this time with Credit Suisse and Citigroup as the advisors. We understand that indicative bids went in last week for that. And we believe that interested parties included EIG this time and BlackRock again. Yeah, I mean, just to comment on just the midstream in general, sort of the sanctity of the offtaker is always something that people think about, just because, you know, at least in the US, less so in Latin America. In the US, you know, we cover so many generations of drillers. I'd say across Acura, it's not essential to information. But these next generation of drillers that have also failed and filed for Chapter 22, which is the second trip through bankruptcy over the last few weeks. Essentially, you know, a lot of these drilling operations were set up five, ten years ago, off the sky-high oil prices. Oil prices collapsed. You saw a lot of drillers collapse. And then reform and recapitalize amongst hedge funds, more as like their equity. But even then, you know, they were betting on recovering oil. It recovered a little bit. It just didn't recover to the extent that they wanted. And you either saw mergers or you saw companies go into Chapter 22. I'm sure if those listeners listened to the other part of our podcast in Acura, they've heard enough about that. But how it applies to pipelines is simple. You know, hopefully those people that are spending lots of money to leverage these pipelines are, you know, reviewing the offtaker twice to make sure that these guys are going to be here in a couple of years. Yeah, most times you're going to get some main guys like Exxon and Chevron up in the US. Again, why I think it's a little bit different down in Latin America is that you have these state-owned gas companies, Pemex, Petrobras, you know, solid guys that aren't going anywhere anytime soon as your offtaker. And that's just sort of a, you know, different dynamic entirely. That's kind of what I've observed. But it's not stopping the flow of money into the space in both regions at this point. No, and the pipeline that Brookfield bought into, the Los Ramones pipeline, it's co-owned in about 5% by Pemex. Pemex is the offtaker for that gas. And interestingly enough, I mean, if you look at the wider macroeconomic situation in Mexico, they're really struggling at the moment. And Pemex is on the verge of losing its investment grade status. So that would trigger a lot of activity in the bond market. And when you talk about solid offtakers, that could be very problematic for them. So I think the Mexican government is doing everything possible to ensure that Pemex remains fully capitalized and fully capable of meeting its obligations. Yeah, that means massive sell-down in the bond market. Interesting. Two more things. Anyway, thanks for listening in today. Just a quick shift to the US market real quick, if you didn't see. It came out quietly last week that St. Louis, for their airport modernization project, finally released their RFQ, possibly after us writing about it for a good 18 months. They give a very truncated time frame. Bids are due November 1st. But I think the sentiment from the market was it's built in. Everybody's educated by this point. You hope they are. And it's not going to take that much time for RFQs to be submitted. You assume with the timeline, perhaps winners get picked, probably in the third or fourth quarter next year. Again, with airports in the US, people like to talk about it, write about it. Investor groups get formed because of it. You need projects to work before they get replicated in the US. And so there's hope, again, that St. Louis gets to that point. They're certainly well-heeled investors that we'll be talking about in the weeks ahead that are going to be involved in this project or want to get involved. And hopefully the project succeeds on its own merits. And there's maybe some other airline RFQs behind it. But we shall see. Anyway, to close us off, Jonathan, I haven't ignored your October 22nd appearance. Just give us a few minutes about that. I'll be in Mexico City for the Merger Market M&A Forum for Mexico 2019. I'll be hosting a panel in the afternoon between about 2.30 and 3.30 on renewable investment in Mexico. So we're going to be looking at all the solar plants and the wind farms, changing in regulation, the evolution of the Mexican market. And we've got some good speakers. We've got Francisco de Rosenzweig from White & Case. We've got Diego Granada from BBVA's Investment Bank. We've got Jaime de la Borra from Balamb Fund, which is co-financing with Nofinsa, the largest wind farm in Mexico, which is Aeolica del Sur alongside Mitsubishi. And we're really excited about the event. We're going to have a good crowd there. We're going to talk about how the market has grown over the years and where it stands now. There's a lot of different issues to discuss in terms of merchant financing, some of the legacy projects which are coming to an end now, and trying to see what comes next for Mexican renewables. Because at the moment when the government has cancelled the auctions, it's very unclear to see exactly how a project is going to move forward. Certainly not in the old way, what's going to be the new way? How are investors and developers going to move these things forward without those previous regimes being in place anymore? Excellent. Look forward to hearing about it. Well, with that in mind, if you can still stand us after the three or four conferences we've talked about, we will see you next month, where we probably have a lot of post-US election analysis to talk about. Hopefully you'll join us then. In the meantime, Burkout. Thanks. And so that's probably the most exciting, the most promising opportunity right now is the...

Welcome to the September edition of Information's Crossroads Podcast. I'm John Burke, America's editor, and we hope to deliver you the most thematic news in project finance within the next 30 minutes or less, or we'll deliver you a free pizza. So joining me today on the podcast is Mike Pichel, a partner at Winston Strong and a long tenured infrastructure employer, to discuss what's been a fairly busy summer in P3 land for good, bad, or as we'll get to, a little bit of ugly too. So thanks for joining us on the show today, Mike. Thanks for having me. Awesome. So we're going to kick off talking ugly, I guess, and get to something better towards the end of the program. What happened in the past month, again, August is supposed to be a quiet month, but it's just not anymore, I guess, was that two higher profile P3 projects basically got canceled. Denver's Great Hall was supposed to be the modernization project at the Denver International Airport, and they had a proponent, and they had gone through a pre-development stage, and finally, there was a construction on the project. 18 months later, Denver canceled out the concession with some very well-established airport investors and developers such as Ferrovial. Then Alabama had their I-10 and BayWa Bridge Improvement Project effectively canceled by the governor late last week after I believe it was a committee had failed to put the subject of the project on the agenda to get approved, which would have made them eligible for federal funds, which they need because it would have covered effectively, a TIFIA loan would have covered 33% of the project. Two divergent stories, but one unfortunate outcome. So Mike, let's start with Denver first. It'd be good to get your perspective about what happened here because you would think they did everything by the book. They didn't just approve this consortium first. They went through a pre-development phase, meaning they wanted to make sure both the agency and the private partner were on the same page with each other as to what they want built and what the design concepts were. And that was an 18-month period, I believe, before this current 18-month construction period. And then once construction commenced, that's when all hell seemed to break loose based on what some of the filings came out. So what can you tell us in terms of your perspective on this? Well, I guess first off, I would just say that I'm not representing anybody in the Denver Great Hall Project. Fair enough. And hadn't been working on it. But typically, I guess when there is a pre-development arrangement like this, it does give both the developer and the project owner the chance to get together and really work to create a project that the owner really wants. The good thing about some of these pre-development arrangements is it gives a project owner a chance to pick the developer it wants to work with and then work with that developer to really craft a project that it wants to see delivered. And certainly, we've seen that work out successfully on a number of other projects in the U.S., notably the Long Beach Civic Center, which was completed earlier this summer in which the City of Long Beach and the Port of Long Beach have now moved into those facilities and are really happy with the finished product. And then similarly, you saw a similar type of procurement run by Purdue University for its student housing project that closed last November, which is now in construction. So there's certainly some other examples of that type of arrangement being used successfully in the market. And unfortunately here, things seem to have fallen apart for what seems like a number of reasons and a fair bit of finger-pointing. Yeah, certainly, if you read the language, it sounded like the consortium had their own issues with the quality of the cement, I believe. And you saw from the other side of things Denver sort of alleging bad faith in the way they were doing their construction overruns, which seems to happen with every project, but it seemed to be what sort of triggered the arrangement to get terminated. I mean, it comes at a very precarious time where there's a lot of investment dollars that are forming or want to be formed to invest in airports In this country, there's a lot of money associated with the JFK project now, sorry, two projects, three projects now at JFK involving a public-private partnership, that being the two terminals. And then you have the mixed-use project, which is in earlier stages and behind that. And then at the other two area airports, Newark and LaGuardia, there's other things afoot there. And of course, there's the two projects that will be constructed at LAX, the People Movers and the Conrack. Do you feel that there's anything within this story that's going to look negative on future P3s at airports in this country? Or you think this is maybe an isolated example? I hope it's an isolated example. It's certainly unfortunate that this has been the result of everybody's hard work in Denver. Nobody likes to see a project cancel. And I think like we had discussed previously, there's been a lot of finger pointing and a lot of accusations leveled on both sides. And I don't want to get into those. I think like a lot of disputes, the reality might be somewhere in the middle, but who knows? I'm not involved. But I think that based on what I understand of some of the challenges that the parties have faced, it sounds like it might be just a project specific issues. I certainly agree with you that there is a lot of investment appetite for airports in the U.S. and coming off the success of the LaGuardia Central Terminal Building Replacement Project, or Terminal B, as it's called now here in New York. There's a lot of hope for the airport sector in the U.S. and I think with some of the regulatory changes that the administration's undertaken, I think people are optimistic about the airport sector generally. There's certainly a lot of excitement about what's going on at JFK. The Port Authority has another procurement I think underway for LaGuardia to develop and operate the Great Hall connecting Terminal B with Terminal C and D at LaGuardia. There's the air train project at LaGuardia that everyone's been talking about for a couple of years. So there's a lot of interesting infrastructure projects in the airport sector here in the U.S. that I think investors won't shy away from simply because of what's happened in Denver. Let's move on to Alabama, where it seems like tolling may have been the red herring here somewhat. I believe we had said total CapEx costs were supposed to be somewhere in the $2 billion range. And it seems like if you do the math, the infragrant they got combined with the TIFIA loan barely gets you through 40% of the CapEx costs. And so you feel like the implication being there that tolling was probably going to get them the rest of the way there. And you read through the stories coming out of Alabama, and it was a very politically sensitive subject, especially if they were, you know, this bridge, again, probably much needed, would have resulted in tolls doubling. Is that how you view the situation, that it was just a very tough thing because of that? Yeah, it's a complicated situation. And I have been working on that project. I do represent one of the shortlisted bidders on that. But, you know, as you said, the metropolitan planning organizations have to include a project in their transportation infrastructure plans in order for the project to be eligible for federal credit assistance. So, you know, the Eastern Shore MPO and the Mobile MPO need to include the project in their TIF in order for it to be eligible for the infragrant, the TIFIA loan, and, you know, allocation of private activity bonds. And unfortunately, you know, one of the MPOs decided to pull the project from the TIF, which is obviously very unfortunate because the project was, I think, heavily reliant on federal credit assistance to help finance it. And so without an infragrant, without a TIFIA loan, and without a private activity bonds allocation, I think the cost of the project would increase exponentially and it would just be really, really tough for the, you know, Alabama DOT to afford a project like that. I think, you know, the MPO taking the action it did does seem to be the result of some backlash against tolling in that area. You know, so, you know, we'll see if this situation continues to unfold, but it is very unfortunate. It does seem like the backlash against tolling in that region has, you know, at least seemingly has killed the project now. Taking it to a higher level, I mean, is there a compromise that can be had in situations like this where, you know, people are willing to reduce the tolling? I mean, there seems to be obviously a very healthy appetite from Pabst Bonds, from what we've seen, and obviously an expansion of the program was put in place in the past couple of years. I mean, is that something you think might come back sooner rather than later? In terms of this particular project? Well, again, I'm trying to not bind your words to a particular project. I'm sort of saying, well, is there a compromise to be had at some point in a situation like this? Well, it ultimately, ultimately, you need to look at what the revenue source is that's going to be to repay the capital on the project, you know, debt or equity capital. And in this case, you know, a decision had been made long ago that this was going to be a demand risk project and user fees were going to be the source of revenue to repay the debt and equity used to, you know, finance the construction of the project. You know, if you were to make compromises on, you know, a project like this or other demand risk projects, you really have to kind of look at the different types of funding sources available. I mean, you could effectively buy down a toll by, you know, procuring authority, making larger milestone payments during construction. But obviously, that has a cost as well. You know, another way you can reduce tolls is by extending the term of the concession. Obviously, it's, you know, you don't need as much. If you have a 50-year concession as opposed to a 30-year concession, you know, obviously, that has an impact on the toll, toll revenue that gets collected and what the toll rates are set at and how they escalate over the term. So, there's a number of different levers that can usually be pushed or pulled in order to come up with the right mix for any particular project. That's also done against the backdrop of what's affordable for the procuring authority, what they can and can't do under state law. You know, there's obviously as many levers as you have, you also have probably equally as many different constraints. So, it really just depends on the project. Great. Okay. Well, let's move to a better plane here with the last couple of days of seeing some advancements in some bigger social projects. Miami-Dade Courthouse, which had been a very long gestating project and had to change sites, I believe, once, finally selected a winner for their, to build the courthouse there. And LA Civic Center, which is going to be a very large project, mixed-use project out of Southern California, was able to shortlist their bidders. And I believe Maryland schools also got there with their shortlist as well. So, you know, three very different versions of social for certain, but, you know, it sounds like all three seem to be advancing and you would hope as much trouble as Miami-Dade's been, they finally did pick a winner. And so, hopefully, you know, that'll advance and get done. I believe the consortium was Plenary and Tudor Perini who made it to the finish line. So, what can we say about social at this point, Mike? It seems like these are projects that there's a lot of political motivation behind, but also they seem to just get over the finish line, sometimes a lot more smoother than some of these large civic projects. Yeah, it's, I think the growth of the social infrastructure sector in the U.S. has been a little bit slow, you know, for one reason or another. You know, the first big social infrastructure, P3, closed in 2010. You know, that was, everyone knows the Long Beach Court Building Project, but there wasn't another social infrastructure project that closed after that for a number of years. I think the next one after that was the Long Beach Civic Center, which was followed closely thereafter by the UC Merced 2020 project. And then I think we saw a couple projects, social infrastructure projects, close in 2018 with both Purdue University's Student Housing Facilities Project and the Howard County Courthouse Project in Maryland. So, we've certainly seen more social infrastructure activity in the last couple of years than we did in, you know, maybe the first five years of the decade. But we're, you know, we're increasingly seeing more social infrastructure opportunities. And it's, you know, it is really exciting to see Miami-Dade finally pick a preferred bidder for its courthouse. I know that that project has had a lot of trials and tribulations along the way, and it's exciting to see the LA Civic, Street Civic Center Project moving forward, the Prince George's County Schools Project moving forward, and as well as some of the other projects, you know, there's the Triangle Project that the City of Denver is looking to undertake at the, as part of the stock show. Yeah, National Western Center, right? National Western Center, yeah, exactly, in Denver. So, that project's moving forward. So, there's a lot of interesting things happening in the social infrastructure market right now, and it, you know, and maybe it's a mix of transportation and social infrastructure, but I also did see that, you know, you reported over the weekend that the New York State Thruway Authority is a tentative awardee for the 27 rest areas, you know, across the thruway system. So, there's, you know, there's a lot of different and exciting things happening in that space. Yeah, I mean, perhaps too, I guess, more manageable since these are buildings being built, and maybe more predictability about how they're going to get paid for in the revenue stream, you know, versus, you know, toll roads in general, maybe that helps lower capex as well. Well, and I, that probably, the size of the projects probably does help. I think they're a little bit more manageable for the procure, some of the procuring authorities that undertake these projects. You know, I think the other thing that's obviously helpful in terms of the length of time that the procurement takes is, you know, what needs to be done from an environmental compliance standpoint. You know, typically vertical infrastructure projects, such as a, you know, a courthouse or a civic center, do not require compliance with NEPA. So, you don't have the lengthy, you know, environmental process that you have on horizontal or, you know, civic, heavy civil transportation. So, you know, that helps speed up the procurement. And, you know, and oftentimes as well, when you're talking about cities and county governments, they're usually a little bit more nimble than statewide or state authorities, you know, states or statewide authorities when they're able to, when they're procuring a project. So, all of that tends to, I think, you know, help. It's just, you know, unfortunately in the past, the projects have been fewer and far between, but certainly the last few years, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. Excellent. So now, looking forward, you know, I think we've seen a lot of authorities in the past start to veer a little bit away from the traditional P3 model or the DBFOM. I think in Canada, you could look at a good cross-section of these projects now, especially on the LRT side that have opted for DBF. As far as the U.S. side of things, you know, it's hard to pin the tail on Pennsylvania, but obviously they blew up a very prolonged process for their broadband project last year and opted to go for a smaller DB, I believe, into two different segments, which is in the process of getting done now. And then there's just the straight out private investment in different systems, like what Star America has been doing, buying into a state data center or, you know, now with their airport project. But you're seeing a lot of different varieties come out in the past couple of years and just sort of moving away a little bit from DBFOM. Do you believe this is like a trend that we should continue to see or you think it's symptomatic of like just these projects and it's more one-off? Well, I'm not sure that there's actually a move away from, you know, design, build, finance, operate, maintain as a delivery model. I think that's still, you know, an important delivery model for greenfield projects. I think, though, what you're seeing is that there's a lot of appetite to invest capital in infrastructure in the U.S. and I think investors are being a little bit more creative or open-minded, I think, about what they're investing in and, you know, and what's infrastructure. And they're looking at different ways to invest in infrastructure in the U.S. and, you know, whether that's through data centers or, you know, or broadband or, you know, or other things. They're just being a little bit more, I think, open-minded in how they, you know, in what they're analyzing and what they're looking at and what they're willing to invest in. The number of, you know, big civil transportation projects that are out there in the U.S. are somewhat limited right now. And so as these, you know, as infrastructure investors are looking to deploy capital, they have to find other avenues to do it. And I think that's really a lot of what we're seeing right now. Great. And to conclude, I guess this builds upon your point, you know, we obviously still have a lot of an emerging, not an emerging class, but a growing class of these middle market infrastructure investors that are out there, new funds that are forming, such as Avaya Capital, sort of the former AECOM P3 team. And then you combine that with all of a sudden a lot of foreign investment flowing into the infrastructure sector in the U.S. through the likes of Arjun and Anton. You know, there's just a lot of different players in the space right now. And I'm kind of wondering if you have an opinion, and you can defer from this, about what subsectors do you think is going to be the subject of a lot of this deal flow coming in over the back half of this year in 2020? Well, I'm not sure it'll actually result in deal flow the next six months, you know, or in early 2020. But I do think that there will be a lot of continued interest in telecommunications and broadband infrastructure. I don't see that going away. So I think that's one sector that will continue to attract interest. You know, obviously, social infrastructure as well. We talked about a number of the projects that are in procurement, but there's others that are not quite there yet. There's a couple of them in Hawaii, I think, that seem to be pretty attractive projects. So I think social infrastructure will continue to garner attention. Data centers as well will continue to be attractive as an investment opportunity. And then obviously, everybody's always looking for great transportation infrastructure to invest in. So I think that will continue as well. Well, Mike, I think that's about all the time we have today. So thanks for joining. We hope you've enjoyed the program and we'll see you for the next edition. Berk out.

I'm John Burke, America's Editor for Information, and we're here to deliver you all the relevant news in project finance in 30 minutes or less, or we'll deliver you a free pizza. Joining me today is a diverse panel. First we have Katie Gavala, our Greenfields reporter for Latin America, then Molly Higgins, a Sparkspread analyst, and Abby Miller, who you've heard before. She's our P3 reporter in the US and Canada. Katie, first we pivot to Central and South America. You've spent a good part of the year reporting on theories and realized dreams, so to speak. We can safely say that South America has a lot of under-invested infrastructure at this point, as you see various development agencies continue to build roads, telecommunications, networks, and transmission and generation for electricity. Where you usually come in on your reporting, of course, is that we see a lot of early-stage situations where these development agencies hire advisors, conduct feasibility studies, and they tend to last a while. These things don't get wrapped up. Exactly. I thought that it would be good for you just to share some of your experiences in terms of which projects have succeeded from all these theoretical stories and why they've succeeded. I will let you take it away. That sounds great. Pretty well-put. Risky business trying to predict which projects are going to come to fruition, but might as well make some guesses here. The first is a group of roads in Chile. Roads are pretty reliable assets. Chile is a pretty reliable market. We understand from the concessions direction office that they are going to be tendering advisory studies for three existing roads, or engineering studies, rather, for three existing roads before the first quarter of next year. These are existing toll roads with known demand. Two of them go through Santiago. These projects should really be a slam dunk. I would be shocked if they didn't happen. Great. They're existing highways in a sense, so they're looking to just modernize and update. That's right. Yeah. Okay. They're going to be a combination, in addition to some new construction works, so these should be pretty solid, reliable projects. Are they going to be adding a toll road aspect to it, or is this going to be kind of like... Tolls already exist, which I think actually makes the project even more appealing, because you already have an idea of what that demand is. There's contracted revenues that you can sort of read. Exactly. The city is also going to launch engineering studies for a packet of four new roads as well, which should be exciting to watch, but I think these three, considering that they already exist, are the ones I'd put my money behind. Excellent. Next, you wanted to discuss Columbia. Yeah. Next is Columbia. They have a tender out for the technical, legal, economic, and financial structuring of a regional airports package, PPP. Cool thing about Columbia right now is that they do have a lot of advisory, pre-feasibility, feasibility study tenders out for new exciting sectors in the country, trained PPPs, water treatment plant PPPs, but unfortunately the country just does not have experience with concession contracts for those types of projects yet. But what they do have experience with is airports that have come to tender. They've got concessions under operation right now. Regional airport packages do well in the secondary market in Columbia. So these are three existing airports, two on the border with Venezuela, one more in the center of the country, and I think we'll see these projects come to tender and that they should be exciting for the market. Excellent. In terms of the secondary transactions you mentioned, who have been some of the buyers of these airports? That's a good question. Our colleague Jonathan Carmody might be a bit better poised to answer it, as I don't track the secondary market very much. But there are two or three major players in the Colombian airport market, so I assume that they would be active in the space. Yeah, I'm guessing Avansi is one of them, because I think they've been buying down there. So last but not least is Costa Rica, often a stop on environmental tours, on the tourist fronts. Had to throw a Central American project in here for good measure. So EDOM was awarded the contract to do the feasibility studies for a San Jose greater metropolitan area light rail, so this is going to connect the capital city with a few surrounding major cities. San Jose is in desperate need of public transportation, rail public transportation specifically. And so, you know, I think one of the more exciting projects is this San Jose train. You know, Central America is always going to be a toss-up, but the reality is right now we're seeing a lot of market players at least watching Central America. Key markets, Peru obviously, and to a lesser extent Chile, are undergoing severe paralysis right now. And as folks are looking for new opportunities, they're watching Central America. Costa Rica is one of the countries that people mention most often as one of the more reliable markets in Central America, and I think that this is one of the more exciting projects happening in Costa Rica right now. The country has a handful of concessions under operation, so that's a good sign. Roads, airports, ports, obviously you start, you know, digging up the streets of San Jose to put in a light rail, that's a very different project from a road. But I think there are reasons to believe that this could be successful. Another interesting thing about Costa Rica is that they just passed a reform to their concessions law that's going to strengthen, you know, that market players are hoping is going to strengthen their concessions pipeline. So one of the key parts of this reform is that they now have allocated funds, six million dollars a year for the next ten years, to devote to pre-investment. So pre-feasibility studies, feasibility studies, sounds like what often happens, everyone wants to do big projects, when it comes time to put up the money for pre-investment, no one's raising their hand. So, and in the past they've had to go about securing the funds in one-off ways, like hey, you have an industry of finance, you have some extra cash. So now these funds are there, they're dedicated for the purpose. So I think we're going to see more study tenders coming out of the country. Interesting. I don't think the US even has something remotely like that. Yeah. Anyway, with that, Katie, thank you for coming on to the program today, appreciate it. Yeah, thank you for having me. The next, we shift to liquefied natural gas demands. Molly, you've done a lot of research for SparkSpread, you also have had some experience working for the New York ISO, just as a side note. What we have is just a big trend coming about eight projects that have already received their final environmental impact statements, are waiting for approval, and where things are going, stand a good chance of getting built and financed. And as you'll talk about in the past, these deals are big, it requires a lot of financing and faith in the capital markets, which has had a very shaky week in the past week or so. But Molly, why don't you tell us what's going on right now, the here and now, and we'll talk about the financing market later. Sure. Happy to. So at the end of 2018, U.S. LNG export capacity stood at 3.6 billion cubic feet per day. And the Energy Information Administration projects that by the end of 2019, U.S. export capacity will more than double and reach 8.9 billion cubic feet. So the U.S. is the third largest exporter in the world behind Australia and Qatar, and it's suggested that that, we're about to become the first in the next five years. So the strong demand for LNG, particularly in Asia, continues to grow as it's an economical way to transport gas to overseas markets. With demand increasing specifically in Asia and Europe, anticipated to absorb majority of the new supply, the U.S. has a lot of projects coming in on the pipeline. So the U.S. has eight projects approved by FERC and that have begun construction. These projects will add 13.53 billion cubic feet, and seven other projects have been approved and still need to secure financing. Once a project has been granted federal authorization, the next step is to make a final investment decision. Of the 12 projects approved by FERC, only five have made a final investment decision. Just recently, Venture Global reached a final investment decision on Calcaseo Pass project and announced financial close this past Monday. This project was oversubscribed at 5.8 billion and took commitments from 13 banks. The project also received 1.3 billion from Stone Peak Infrastructure Partners' third fund. So this deal is a promising sign for LNG since it shows a strong appetite from the bank market as well as continued interest in the sector from the equity market. Also recently, Chenier closed the financing to construct its sixth train at Sabine Pass. The financing comprised of a $750 million term loan and $750 million revolving credit to match with over 25 banks involved. Here, Chenier used the same model it did for Sabine Pass, which is a model that has the developer go to market for a construction term loan for the facility's first train with the expectation to refinance over and over in the capital markets to fund the rest of the trains. The one exception in LNG we've seen so far is the Golden Pass project, and that's because it didn't use project finance. Its shareholders, Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were able to pay for the entirety of its development on their own. This project achieved its FID earlier this year. So still for this next wave of LNG export projects to occur, 14 need to obtain FERC approval. Each of these projects currently project that they should reach an FID by the end of 2020, but we have seen in the past this date keeps getting pushed back further and further. Still, this means that there's a possibility of 14 projects that could be approaching the bank market in the next 18 months or so. Great. You mentioned Qatar and Australia. Are they both chiefly serving the Asian market as well? Asian and the European market. Those are the two biggest causes of demand. Is there a severe drop-off after this top three, I'm sort of wondering, in Australia, Qatar, and the U.S.? I'd have to double check on that, but I'm pretty sure in research they're the only three names that appear. Okay. Got it. Okay. So let's talk about the financing market a little bit longer. Yeah. I mean, 14 projects is a lot, not only for the bank market, but also for signing the off-taker, which is the important part about this whole thing. Exactly. And that makes all the difference in the world when you're talking about having your capacity contracted or building something on spec, which is what we deal with all too often in the IPP market in the U.S. But why don't you explain how it applies to LNG, the risks associated with building up financing? Right. These banks, they want to see where the project's revenues are coming from. So for these projects to even approach banks, they need at least, the golden number is 80% of its capacity contracted. Right now, only one of the 14—so five of the projects of the 14 have sale and purchase agreements in place. Only one of them, as it stands right now, has enough contract volumes that are sufficient enough to secure debt finance, and that's Port Arthur Phase 1, which has agreements with Saudi Aramco and PGNIG for a total of 7 of the project's 11 million tons per annum. This doesn't reach that magic number of 80% contracted, but it is being referred to as a sturdy enough number to hit the market. So then the issue we have in the LNG space is that just one of 14 proposed projects has enough contracted capacity in place. And we're in a space right now where we have this trade war with China. China is expected to be the biggest buyer of LNG. So right now, all those contract negotiations that these projects were having have essentially been put on pause. And so we typically expect that a contract would be put in place, and these projects can then hit the bank market. We're kind of in an uncertain point, because we'd like to say that they're going to hit the bank soon, but without these contracts, we just don't know. It's possible that they could pivot to Europe, but I don't suspect them to, since it's pretty secure that China is the place to get where you want to be. Kretzmann Yeah, sure. Well, it's going to be really interesting to watch for that. Because obviously, as you saw by Costco Pass, a lot of banks who are participating in the market and StonePeaks become a very significant and influential infrastructure fund investor. So it's going to be really fascinating to watch how this unfolds. Well, thank you for that, Molly. I appreciate the update. So Abby, this brings us to the P3 market, where we've, again, kind of had a rough quarter all in, with a couple other players reporting damage on their P3 contracts, withdrawing, sort of looking at USNC Lavalin, they're dropping out of the market. And then all of a sudden, a really significant project that people do case studies on and talk about a success story falls apart. And this is the Great Hall project at the Denver International Airport. Ferrovial and their partners were picked about four or three years ago, to basically modernize and update a segment of the Denver International Airport. So that's the launching point, Abby, let me let's hear exactly what happened at this point in the past few weeks with respect to this. Right, thanks, JB. So, as obviously all the listeners probably know at this point, the Denver International Airport decided to terminate its contract with Great Hall partners. Like you said, that's led by Ferrovial, which is a global airport developer. So that was seen as pretty unusual, because it's not like they don't have experience or they took on too much, they should have been able to handle this project. And it's not to say that they weren't. But I mean, it was a pretty unusual project, even back in the tendering stage, and then also the city and the authority had kind of been at odds with GHP from the beginning. Like you said, they were selected in June 2016 as the preferred bidder. But they were selected under the pretense that they would further negotiate with the airport during the pre-development phase of the deal. So they didn't reach financial close for another 18 months, when the bonds priced in December of 2017. Also, the airport let teams bid on an indicative basis. So they were offered, basically they could pick their method of risk transfer. So you know, whether availability or revenue risk. You know, I spoke to one source who said that Ferrovial did kind of a risk reversion where they accepted a lot of it upfront, and then started shifting it back to the airport. And then there were also just delays based on structural conditions tied to compressive strengths of the concrete and change orders during the initial phases of construction. So the GHP said that delays caused just by that could delay construction for an additional three years. And then also, I mean, this was a couple days after the decision to cancel the contract. But GHP said it could cost as much as a billion dollars to finish the project because of delays and these issues with construction. And so I mean, that's just an entire mess. So now they're talking about finding a replacement contractor because they own all the first phase of design. So I don't know that they know yet what delivery method they're going to use. But they have said that they're going to use the existing designs. And they are targeting the first quarter of 2020 to hire a new, or to have a new contractor mobilize an onsite so ready to start construction for the project. And I mean, it seems like there's not necessarily one exact cause for this cancellation. It's a whole bunch of things. But it's definitely worth noting that Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, he barely won his reelection campaign back in June. And an ally of his and two other incumbents were defeated in the city council election. So I think that was more than almost half, I think, of the city council was brand new. And then also the Denver's Office of Performance Based Infrastructure, which didn't run that project but is running the other P3 in the area, the National Western Center, which I'll talk about in a minute, saw its interim executive director, Emily, I believe her last name's pronounced Haber, depart. And so they're hiring someone new there. And I mean, there's concern just regarding the new political environment as there always is, you know, whether or not they're going to be friendly towards P3s or alternative delivery methods at all. And then, I mean, to go back to the National Western Center, there were two teams shortlisted for that project in July. One is led by Macquarie. The other is led by Plenary. And they've said that the RFP should come in the fall. I spoke to people at the P3 office there. They said that the issue with the Denver airport isn't going to impact them. They said that the two things aren't related. But like I said, there's concern because of the new political environment. And when you see this huge project fail, this, like you said, I mean, they were doing, it's hailed as a success story. There's a, the San Diego airport has hailed the Great Hall project as, you know, the reason that they're considering using a P3 for a project that they're looking at. And when you see something like that fail, it's, I mean, it causes concern in the whole market and especially in Denver. We could probably hold a separate, and we will be holding a separate podcast on ramifications and on airport P3 projects at some point in the near future. And the reason why I mention this is because, you know, we have a couple of high profile projects over here in New York. We have JFK with their two big terminal projects. We have potential for more development at LaGuardia and NORC as well. And then you head out west and people again think there's a potential for P3 is again San Diego with their proposal. And then talk about another airport in the LA area developing here. LA itself, of course, there's a hive of development, but there's a lot and a lot of issues came out of this, I think, which reflect broadly upon the sector about the mix, the dynamic between an airport authority and a private partner and that balance, which seems to not exist in Europe, but here it does, where people have to balance the interests of the public sector and the private sector and somehow has to all come together. And it doesn't come together that neatly or as we'd like to see LAX, I think, was a success story because they weren't modernizing the airport. They weren't building a runway. They were building ancillary projects that were needed anyway. And there was significant political goodwill behind it because there was an Olympiad coming to town in 2028. So they got a people movers done. It takes you right to a CONRAC, a Consolidated Rent-a-Car Center. And that's all that's being done between the two projects. The terminals aren't being affected there by all this. It's making logistics move quicker. So I think it's probably a broader topic for a broader day. But thanks for updating us on this particular project, Abby, and we'll see what the next steps are in the procurement. Like you said, there's a design there already. So we've written before, rarely, but written before about these design-bid-build projects. Maybe this is what happens because the design's already there. So the contractor's literally just taking the project and running with it. I think your sources indicated it might be something else. Yeah, it could be construction manager at risk. It could be a progressive design-build. I think it's a little... I mean, the airport authority, I contacted a few people there and they gave me no indication that they have even, I guess, kind of gotten there. I think it was a little too early when I contacted them, maybe in a month or so. They'll have a better idea. It's a little too early, but we don't want to be the only ones asking that question either. So anyway, just another quick, maybe a successful note in airport land, you know, because why end the podcast on a bad note? We've talked about negative Nellies for the past 30 minutes here. Anyway, so last week, Airglades International Airport, which is a suburban Florida airport project, selected AFPORTS as airport operator and Star America. Basically, it's an all-cargo airport that we've written before about in information. It's kind of there to give an alternative method of delivering cargo outside of the Miami International Airport. So it looks like they're looking to start construction in the ... Sorry, there's an existing airport there already, but they got the capital commitments now to convert it to a bigger airport. I believe there's going to be new runways involved and new facilities built. So we're going to begin construction in the first quarter of 2020. And so that's, again, another sort of use of public-private partnerships outside of the traditional P3s we've written about that got done. So good news in that front. Anyway, so we end this summer with lots of news going on, and this is going to certainly continue through the rest of the year. So stick with us, and we'll see you on the September edition of the podcast, Berk Out. Be safe. Be well. 
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2019-07-29 00:34:54+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Pipelines and Big Pipeline\n**Episode ID:** 4458\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the July edition of Information's Crossroads podcast, where we'll deliver all the project finance news in 30 minutes or less, or you'll get a free pizza. I'm John Burke, Americas editor, joining me today in the studio is US and Canada features man Andrew Vitelli, a newcomer to the program, Daniela Urias, an energy analyst for Infra's SparkSpread platform, and finally dialing in from the Brooklyn home office today is LATAM news editor Jonathan Carmody. Welcome to the program, everyone. Thank you for having us on. Happy to be here. Thanks, JV. So today we're going to talk a little bit about our league tables for the first half of 2019, and we'll end it with talking about Daniela's recent analysis piece on electric vehicle charging stations. But first, we talk about US and Canada. Andrew, we can talk more about brownfield deals and midstream and energy, a little bit less on the greenfield front. But why don't you tell us what the recent developments have been in the US and Canada for the first half of 2019? Yes, if you look at the headline numbers for the first half, it's pretty much where it was in 2018. The total amount of deals was 226. That's a little bit more than we're about 195 or so last year in the same period. Total value, 65.7 billion. That's up from about 62 billion the year before. So a little bit of growth year over year, but still in the same frame. And I think the story, if you look, especially at the brownfields, the greenfields, too, to some degree, is energy, energy, energy. 75% of the deals were either in energy, power, or renewables. So that really was the dominant—those were the dominant sectors in the first half. And one of the biggest stories was we saw a lot of multibillion-dollar midstream oil and gas deals. The biggest one was Stone Peak's $3.6 billion acquisition of Oryx, which is focused on Permian crude. That deal closed in May. We also had the first deal out of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners. That's the megafun that's eventually going to be $40 billion. They bought out Tallgrass Energy, led a deal to buy out Tallgrass Energy that was a $3.3 billion deal. Those assets are centered around Wyoming's Powder River and Wind River Basin. We also had Sempra selling a nearly 2-gigawatt wind portfolio. So overall, most of the activity was in the energy, power and energy, and renewable space, especially in midstream energy. And then the one sector that continues to be fairly slow is transportation. The biggest deal was the $2.5 billion sale of Direct Chassis Link in terms of brownfields. And that's something that's kind of in the periphery of what you would consider a typical transportation asset. There still is very little activity on the US P3 front. If you look at the whole first half in terms of greenfield, there was less than a billion dollars in PPP deals compared to over $4 billion in Canada. So there is some optimism that maybe that could pick up a little bit in the second half, particularly in the social sector. But so far, very little activity in that space. Let's talk about midstream for a moment because it's often good to remind our viewership about where we are there. The US oil and gas space has had a pretty rocky couple years. Our sister publication, DebtWire, can testify that a lot of these drillers got hit by the low oil prices, which made it economically inefficient to just drill oil and make money at the same time, resulted in a string of bankruptcies. A couple of years later, a lot of midstream deals, $1 billion a piece, wedding infrastructure funds. Tell us why this is more of a consistent revenue stream in the grand scheme of things and why infrastructure funds have been so attracted to the space. Part of the reason, of course, that they're attracted to the space is because they have a lot of capital to deploy. But the typical ownership structure, the MLPs that were holding this before in the past historically, they really relied on consistently growing. And the things that you mentioned that have happened in terms of the prices of oil and gas being a little bit less, coming down a little bit, that has raised real questions about the sustainability of those ownership models. And at the same time, you're getting a sense from some of these companies that the public markets are undervaluing these assets. And that has created a real opportunity for these infrastructure funds to move in. And these funds are very happy to, you know, a lot of these places, a lot of these infrastructure investors have raised these multi-billion dollar funds and are seeing limited deployment opportunities in the traditional infrastructure sectors. So they're more than happy for the opportunity to deploy $3 billion in one deal. But over the long run, they maybe have a little bit less concern about some fluctuations on a month-to-month basis in the price of oil and gas than somebody who's really constantly tapping the public markets. And as for the U.S. greenfield markets, you know, the point we can at least make there is that, you know, we've been covering a couple of big social projects, two big energy projects in the university space, and two Civic Center projects come to mind, Los Angeles and the Nat Western Center in Denver. Both look like candidates to get done. Timing a little bit uncertain, but it sounds like fourth quarter of 19, first quarter of 2020 is where we see these projects close. And what's really interesting on the horizon is, and it's still there, is JFK, the terminal project being held by the Carlyle Group and these four airlines. There is talk that there could be financial close on that deal in the first quarter of 2020. However, the timetable keeps getting pushed back. Originally it was slated to close by the end of the year. So things to watch out for the back half of the year. Yes. As I mentioned, there is some optimism that maybe at least some of these social deals could end up hitting financial close in the second half. Yeah. Well, we shall see. Moving on to Mr. Carmody, why don't you take us into Latin American league tables. The huge, huge deal in the pipeline space drove it as well as Brazil. So let's hear some of the developments. That's right, JB. We're talking about the Transporto Social de Gas transaction in Brazil. This was an ongoing privatization process that saw many international bidders. It was eventually won by CDPQ and Engie. And it turns out it ended up at around $8.6 billion for the 90th cent stake in the gas network in the northeast of Brazil. And there was a lot of financing associated with this, $2.5 billion in loans from seven international banks and $3.6 billion in bonds issued by three local banks. Now, the $8.6 billion figure makes this the largest deal in information deals history. It's bigger than all of those giant Australian highways we've seen and other transactions around the world. So it's really important for Latin America. As we said, it's part of the privatization drives in Brazil. There's a lot of assets on the block from transmission lines to sanitation companies to highways. So, you know, big success for Brazil. They got what they wanted. They managed to avoid all of the complications with the courts and they finally got this one over the line. So well done to CDPQ, Engie, and their financial advisors, Citibank. It's not the only big deal to close in the period. We also saw Odebrecht finally sell its hydroelectric plant, Chagia, a 450 megawatt plant. And they sold this to the Chinese investors, China Three Gorges, for about $1.4 billion. But the interesting thing about the asset, which we reported on, is that they won't actually get a lot of the money, Odebrecht. They initially reported that they were going to get about half of it. But speaking to our sources, there are a lot of outstanding debts that they owe to the country in terms of tax bills, labor costs, and government mandated civil reparation for the corruption scandal. Let's just remind our listeners that this corruption scandal stretched all around Latin America and all across the globe. Last night, we saw one of the ex-presidents, Toledo, arrested in San Diego, California, where he's been hiding out from the law and he's now undergoing extradition process. He's one of four Peruvian presidents who got in trouble for bribes from Odebrecht. They reckon that he allegedly received around $20 million for his campaigns. And he, like Pablo Kuczynski, Ollanta Humala, and Alan Garcia, have all found themselves accused of collusion with a Brazilian company. But it's good to see that Odebrecht has finally solved that asset. Very interesting to see that it's China Three Gorges and a consortium of Chinese investors that have acquired it. We know that China Three Gorges is very active in the region. We know also that they've bid for some of Sempra's assets in Luz del Sur in Peru as well. So this could be a big player that we're going to see in lots of power and energy acquisitions across the region. So those two assets are in the power and energy sections. But we've also seen that the old stalwart of Latin America, the highways, continue to be incredibly popular. CBP and OTPP completed a 49% stake acquisition of the Pacifico-Sul highway, which was owned by IFM investors, Aliatica, Aliatica obviously being the ex-OHL concession that IFM investors acquired a couple of years ago. And we've also seen that companies like SASE, who've done so much investing in Latin America in recent years, they recently closed some Greenfield Highway financing in Colombia. But they also sold in the first half a 49% minority stake in some of their Chilean assets to Tehuesca. Tehuesca had previously bought a minority stake in one of their highways and had acquired other assets. But it's now looking like a serious player in the Chilean market. It's a relatively new fund for us. Quite a trend we're seeing in Latin America that there are new fund managers appearing, ex-investment bankers who set up their own funds and their own vehicles to invest in these assets. Just like two of the other funds that we've seen recently, talking about highways, Brookfield managed to sell 33% of its urban highways in Santiago, the Vespucio Norte and the Tunel San Cristóbal, to a couple of new funds. New entries with their first investments, BanChile, which is Citibank's subsidiary down in Chile, and Frontal Trust, an investment company that had never invested in infrastructure before. So, it's interesting to see new players enter the market, and it's interesting to see how traditional players readjust their portfolios over time to try and free up capital to make new investments and continue to grow. Excellent. Thank you for that. Do you get any sense, particularly in Brazil, about where the acquisition multiples were in terms of whether they were in line, what do you say, with other Latin American deals, or were they extraordinary? That's an interesting question, but as I said, this is the largest deal. In terms of the multiples, I'm not aware of what that represented here. But it's certainly a large deal. Yeah. I mean, I think you can get where I'm getting at there. Is it to a level of irresponsibility where we could see there being issues down the road? But I guess to your point, we don't know enough quite yet to say one way or the other. I would think the tendency for these large investors like CDPQ, like NG, is very much to invest in regulated assets, assets backed by public contracts, and incredibly important public services. We've seen that countries like Mexico and Venezuela have had incredible trouble fueling their power grids and their networks. So I think a lot of companies are now looking at power and energy assets as real essential infrastructure, real core infrastructure, that's a pretty safe haven for their cash. Okay. Well, thanks for that, Jonathan. Appreciate your time. So Daniela, you did an analysis piece looking at electric vehicle infrastructure, or basically charging stations, as demand for electric vehicles comes up, the need for infrastructure or these charging stations, likely in and among gas stations in the country. There's a clear demand for these, but as your research showed, not a lot of appetite for it. So why don't you update us as to what your findings were on this? Yes, of course. So when looking at the electrical vehicle market, we're seeing an increase in growth driven by governmental efforts to decarbonize transport sectors, along with consumer trends where consumers are moving away from gas-fueled vehicles. So just to give you an idea, in 2015, there were 300,000 EVs in the market. And in 2018, we saw this number jump to 890,000 vehicles. So despite this expansive EV growth in the market, investments in EV infrastructure, as you mentioned, usually charging stations that supply energy to these vehicles, hasn't grown. So to date, the estimated cost to require the support or this gap with this expansive EV market growth through 2035 ranges from $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion per year. So that shows that not only one-fourth of the charges required are installed and operational, but that the necessary additional deployment would have to grow about 20 percent per year. So the main question is, why aren't people investing? There's so many big players, such as oil companies, utilities, and energy companies that aren't investing in this infrastructure that seems to be necessary. So what we see is that the cost of deployment, in my analysis, and the development, along with the lack of demand, have been main deterrents. The current business model doesn't allow for consumers to charge their electric vehicles at a cost-friendly and accessible option that is competitive with oil. When looking at key energy players, we think that they should be investing in electric vehicles and electric charging stations. But it's seen that these companies are only investing in electric charging companies that focus on developing the technology but not deploying the necessary infrastructure. So we analyzed how utilities are in the best position to build and manage charging stations as experts in providing energy. However, despite increases in demand, utilities still would require an even higher demand to meet these attractive returns. So just to give you another idea, utilities in the U.S. and Canada only own 156 of the total 26,341 operational electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. So there are a lot of companies that are developing the technologies, but these companies are not focusing on deploying or maintaining or operating, as I mentioned earlier. So we're talking about government entities and government incentives that are either investing or putting in initiatives such as legislation to promote charging stations. This past month, the Michigan legislature introduced a bipartisan package that would increase access to EV charging by allowing the state to install EV charging stations in park and ride lots or at state parks, either directly or by lease. So we do see that governments are trying to implement or facilitate these investments. But although this legislation is supporting EV growth, we don't see much involvement in the sector throughout the United States. So we have seen some big oil companies investing in energy companies, as I mentioned. These companies usually focus on the technology, but not in the deployment. To give you an example, BP recently acquired ChargeMaster, and Shell recently acquired NewMotion. But these companies also only focus on the technology. So without a doubt, these companies understand that – these companies and big investors that a competitive market requires competitive buyers and competitive prices. And to the moment, we haven't really seen that. So what we can say about the market is until that demand increases and that these investments or incentives are even higher, people will start investing. But until now, we'll just have to wait and see what people will be doing and what these investors are planning to do in the future. I have a question, which I think might just be the follow-up to your research piece. Go ahead. Obviously, the U.S. has a system that's probably comparable in some ways to other parts of the world in the fact that their gas stations are owned – they can be mom and pops, but they can also be companies that own and just basically lease the oil from big oil, like BP, like Hess. Or the oil companies could own those gas stations, too. I don't think it's all separated quite yet. So these guys offer the technology. They own companies that do the technology. The bigger question is why aren't they offering it to their affiliates that own these gas stations or even their own gas stations, where your statistics clearly show they only own a micro-fraction of these charging stations? Exactly. I would definitely say that that would be the next move, or the ideal market. Well, I mean, in cases of these companies, we have to figure out if it's proven technology or not. Exactly. Which is going to be the key. It's always good to see it skip a cycle in the sense you have these bigger, well-heeled companies that are willing to invest in these technologies, where in the past, nascent technologies never seem to succeed in generation one or two at times. I'm not criticizing the entire venture capital community, but venture capitalists do invest. Some blow up. Some work. It's just a very mediocre cycle, and eventually the technologies that get proven get acquired by bigger, heeled guys. Here, it seems it's the case of where they're getting in a little bit early to develop this technology. So I guess we'll see what happens. Yeah. The main issue would be the unpredictability of either demand. The demand is really high, but it hasn't been high enough to prove that these investments will be profitable. And you're also looking at an unpredictable trends in mobility. Cities are changing, so they don't really know if they should be investing either in the inside of the city or the outskirts of the city, depending on what the future of mobility looks like. You're talking broader themes of whether cars are a need. Exactly. Yeah. Got it. Sure. That's a fair question. Well, more to come, Daniella. Thanks for taking the time today. So we're out of time on the podcast today. Hope you're enjoying your summer, not on this particular reading day, but we'll be back next month. Brook out.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2019-06-07 19:25:29+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### 2019 forecast, Maryland, Illinois and Colombia\n**Episode ID:** 4459\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:01\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to the June edition of Information's Crossroads Podcast, where we deliver you the best in project finance news in 30 minutes or less, or we'll deliver you a free pizza. I'm John Burke, America's editor for Information News. We got less than a week to go before the USP3 conference scheduled to commence on Wednesday, June 12th, at the Hyde in Midtown, New York, amidst multiple developments that came out of the procurement world in recent days. Here to discuss are Abigail Miller and Melissa Guthrie of the Americas team. Welcome to the podcast, ladies. Later in the podcast, Latin American analyst Juan Pereira brings some updates to the table south of the border. Melissa, why don't you kick us off and tell us about the market so far in terms of deal flow, how 2018 panned out, and what's to come in 2019, specifically for Greenfield, and the TPP developments in the US? Thanks, JB. We are now at the beginning of the month of June, which is almost the end of the first half of the year, so I think this is a good time to do a little recap of what has happened in the last six months in the USP3 market, and also what we can expect for the rest of the year. Also, as you said, this comes at the right time, as we are having the USP3 conference next week. Around this time last year, the USD 1.92 billion LAX automated people mover deal had closed, ending the first half in a positive note. The project represented all components of a perfect P3, a strong consortium, well-known sponsors, private activity bonds, and large construction debt. This half of the year has been a bit less encouraging, with only two deals reaching financial close. The Newark-Conrack, so that was just recently in May, for USD 500 million and a consortium led by Fengate, and the Travis County Courthouse in April, just two months ago, and this was led by Hunt Development. In fact, the latter, the Travis County Courthouse, is not a traditional P3, as it is more like a design-build finance, doesn't have any equity. KeyBank provided the revolving credit facility for this one. On the debt side, up to now, we have only seen bank debt and no private placements or private activity bonds, which were quite high last year and quite important in volume, especially because of the LAX project, which had such a large amount of private activity bonds. As a point of comparison, four P3 projects closed in Canada this half year, Canada, which was the second country in our world rankings for Greenfield P3s in 2018, and only one in the UK. I think that this year will be considerably slower on the Greenfield P3 front. There are no big projects in view to close this year in the US. However, I think that there are a few projects to keep an eye on this year that could close or that can considerably at least advance. One positive part. We have the LA Civic Center. There's five teams that returned RFQs, including players such as Fengate, Plenary, Meridia, Macquarie. We even see SNC in one of the teams. There's the Honolulu Rail Transit. Plenary and ACS were shortlisted on that one. Some Nashville parking airport and parking meters. Prince George County issued the RFQ just recently for its public schools. It also wants to reach financial close by the end of the year. I don't know how that will happen, but hopefully we'll see. We've learned over time that procurement agencies get blasted when they have aggressive timetables. Although the projects that they are describing here, this is the Prince George's County schools project, I believe was four or five schools, five, six, okay, five to six schools. I think it's going to be a new experience, I think, for us because we haven't covered that many school designs over here. There have been school projects elsewhere globally, so that'll be one to watch. I think, yeah, they are saying six months. They want to get to a proponent and financial close by the end of the year. A few more projects. One is the Denver National Western Center. RFQs were returned in May. Projects included Macquarie and Plenary. The Maryland Managed Lanes Project, we're all waiting for the RFQ to launch. Let's see what's going on on that one. Should be imminent. Maybe the Miami-Dade Courthouse could advance. We still don't know what model exactly it will be under, but it will certainly be an interesting one. Then I also did a quick study to identify the average procurement time for projects in the U.S. This is according to our data from information deals. On average, from the moment the RFQ for a project is issued to financial close, a project takes about 2.3 years. We need to keep in mind that this number includes environmental projects, so this number is kind of inflated because of the very lengthy process for these projects that take, on average, five years to close after RFQ launch. Those 2.3 years are actually more 1.8 or something like that, so less than two years. That said, even though the greenfield activity hasn't been very strong, the brownfield and refinancing activity for P3s has been stronger than previous years. We've seen how many? We have three refinancings that happened in this first half of the year and one sale. In terms of refinancing, we had Carlsbad refunding. There was also the sale of the Ohio River bridges with BBGI acquiring an additional 33 percent stake, so quite a lot going on there. Two refinancing of the highways in Puerto Rico, the PR22 and PR5, so quite a few that went on this year compared to what we had seen in previous years. I think there are a few more deals that could advance this year and potentially close. There were talks about a refinancing for the North Tarrant Expressway, sale of Carlsbad that's quite advanced, Connecticut Service Plaza is quite advanced as well, so there might be a bit more activity on the brownfield side and refinancing side. I also wanted to end on another positive note, just to say that if we look at all the deals in the market for P3s today, and that's taking into account very early stage projects, some might never be launched, but I think it's still positive. There's a pipeline of 317 deals that are at either pre-launch, transaction launch, so RFQ launch, or all the way through to preferred proponents, so that could close in the next years. I won't say next year. Thanks for that update, Mélisse. Two points to that regarding the private activity bonds, we're going to get an update that I think for certain at P3 next week. One of our keynote speakers on day one is going to be Dan DiBuono. He's the chief infrastructure officer, newly minted chief infrastructure officer for the U.S. Department of Transportation, and his department sits in charge of that program, basically, and he seems ready and willing to talk about it. On day two, speaking to another point Mélisse mentioned about environmental projects, one of the projects we've covered through a torturous, I think, four or five year period has been the Fargo-Moorhead project, which has been run by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. Joining us on day two as a keynote speaker is Aaron Snyder, who sits in charge of the funding and financing for WIFIA and P3 program development for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. Now Fargo-Moorhead got a recent decision reversed, and finally, there seems to be indications that that project's going to proceed, and they have teams shortlisted, and that's going to be a really, really good development to watch over the second half of the year. Anyway, on to some more recent developments. Mélisse had referenced Maryland. There has been quite a debate that took place this week regarding that project, and here to tell us about it is Abby. Abby, why don't you go ahead and walk us through it a little bit? Yep. Thanks, JB. So this week, the Board of Public Works finally approved the P3 designation for the project, meaning that the governor and the Maryland DOT can go ahead and move forward with procurement. That said, there were a number of concessions to the project that the governor and the DOT had to exchange in order to get this approval. One of the concessions basically changes the entire scope of at least the first phase of the project. So initially, the first phase was going to be, I think, between $5 and $7 billion, and it was going to include the DBFOM of price-managed lanes in Virginia, starting at the George Washington Parkway, and then reconstructing or rehabilitating the American Legion Bridge and extending price-managed lanes into Maryland along 495 and 270. Now the first phase will only include improvements to Interstate 270. That's because there's been a lot of political backlash. Local governments have been attempting to pass legislation that could have impacted the timeline, that it could have made it more expensive, and that includes things like requiring further environmental studies, legislation that could have required individual county approval for each county that the toll lane would have extended into, which then one county doesn't approve it, and suddenly the entire project is scrapped. And while none of that has become law, it seems that Governor Hogan kind of wants to garner a bit more public support or maybe legislative support before pushing forward with the project, considering its scale. So yeah, like I said, now the first phase is improvements to I-270, and that's a stretch of the highway that starts at I-495 and extends to I-370. He said during the Public Works meeting on Wednesday that he's hoping the public or the residents in Montgomery and Prince George's counties can encourage their legislators to come around to using the price-managed lanes for I-495 and the American Legion Bridge. I guess those are the two counties that are putting up the most resistance to having these toll lanes. And we're not exactly sure what the plan for this procurement is, if it will be a DBFOM, the scope, but it definitely will not be nearly as large as the first phase was initially supposed to be or planned to be. It's also not exactly clear what stages two and three will entail. The project will still be split into three stages, but we just don't know what the next two stages will be or when they'll come. Additionally, another concession was that the board and the governor approved a monorail feasibility study for I-270, so this will allow local transit buses to use the managed toll lanes at no charge. Also, right-of-way can't be taken away until the entire environmental review process is complete. It doesn't seem like this is going to impact the procurement timeline. From everything we've heard from people in the industry, they don't think it's going to. They think the RFQ is still imminent. Because the RFQ still hasn't been released, we definitely can't say that for sure. And then once the process is complete, all of the contracts following procurement will have to go back to the board for approval before anything can be built, before financial close can be reached. Is the reduced I-270 proposal inclusive of a managed lane, or is it going to be more of the upkeep of the actual roadway? From my understanding, it's more of the upkeep. That's how it's worded. There certainly could be a managed lane. And the way that the governor worded it, it almost seemed like there would be some sort of tolling apparatus, because he worded it in such a way that suggested that he wanted people to get used to paying these tolls to see that, see how much of an improvement it could make in their lives. So I think there could be a managed lane, but I'm not sure. Based on, I still haven't heard anything about the scope of this project. And based on, this was going to originally be phase two of the project, and it did not seem like there would be managed lanes in the initial plan for this. But now, because things have been switched up, I'm just not sure. Yeah. I mean, it totally makes it easy for this to be a DBFOM, but absent that, it might as well just be a design build to whatever it is. I mean, that's interesting. Well, I guess we will find out once some RFQ is released. So at the US P3 conference next week, Pete Rahn from the Maryland Department of Transportation will be speaking fairly early. I believe he's on the road panel scheduled for 10 or 10.30 that day, along with another big road builder, Jennifer Ament, the head of Transurban North America. So hopefully we'll get some more insights on this reduced proposal. Thanks for that, Abby. Moving on to the great state of Illinois, another avalanche of potential greenfield information came out last week in the wanting days of the General Assembly in the spring. With a partisan government in place, Governor Pitzker was able to get a $40 billion infrastructure spending bill passed that will be funded by, among other things, doubling the gas tax, charging a registration fee for electric vehicles, and other measures. The first greenfield project out of this will be to build a $3.8 billion transit hub that will consolidate multiple agencies and be anchored by a commercial development. However, other measures were passed to encourage infrastructure spending, such as enacting tax breaks to encourage data center building, which is becoming a major, major greenfield initiative for infrastructure funds as of late. And though there has been some hope for more projects, such as the long-gestating I-55 managed land project, it did not get passed by the General Assembly during this session. However, Pitzker's ambitions less than six months into his term suggest this and other projects are coming. Juan, thanks for joining us today. It's been a fairly active month, as always, in Latin America. Hard to isolate what's important, but there was a recent court development in Colombia and also potentially funding in the works in Argentina, which could have a meaningful impact on the market. So I thought it would be good if we discussed both of those topics today. Why don't we start talking about Argentina first? Thanks for coming. Thank you for having me. No, I mean, in Argentina what happened is we reported that BICE, which is a state-owned bank, a state development bank, which is also in charge of the PPPs, announced a credit line for $100 million to start construction of the PPP projects. This is a sign that the PPP program is quite not ready yet to reach financial close, as they are – if we do the math, they are doing $100 million. We don't know how much each project is going to get, but we're talking about six projects. So roughly, we can do the math, that it's not – this is a $6 billion project, so this is only $100 million, but still it will allow the government to announce and the consortiums to start construction shortly. How much of an impact this will be, it's still undecided for the future, but it will still give some funding while they're in the works with the IDB to create a trust that will also provide, in this case, more money, $1 billion. But still, it's $1 billion of a $6 billion program, so there are still more developments ahead. The interest part here is, obviously, we have reported about the financial problems Argentina is having right now and how is it impacting its PPP and renewable pipeline. But also regarding the reputational risk, this is like a sign of them – because in order to get these kind of credit lines, they have to sign a reputational agreement with some specifications very strict that were done with the IDB support as well. So in this case, it is kind of giving them money but also securing like a guarantee for reputational risk in this case. So why don't you tell us about the Columbia Court ruling? Yeah, the Columbia Court ruling was something that the market was expecting quite for a while now, that was the Constitutional Court had to decide whether sponsors, equity sponsors could get reimbursed even if the contracts were canceled because of corruption. And also what would happen with the technical advisors, the lenders, and other people involved in the project. What the Court decided is that for the – as of the lenders, they could be reimbursed for the cancellation. However, the equity sponsors are not going to be reimbursed for the cancellation, which is – in one way, the first thing we can think about is, OK, this is fair because they were involved in a corruption scheme, so they're not going to be reimbursed. But on the other hand, this points out to a huge problem in Latin America. So now when projects get canceled, what's happening to those projects? So what we reported on and what we are hearing in the market – To back up for a sec for our listeners there, obviously when there's contractors and they go into default, there's payments made. How do the folks or the backers of that project recover their cost of capital? That is – the issue is going to be with the equity sponsors, but also the issue is going to be – so if the equity sponsors cannot be reimbursed, this is also a huge risk for people buying projects. So the M&A process of projects that could be canceled or someone like – I don't know, let's name the big name here, Odebrecht. So you will never buy another project because you will never know as of now what could be a reputational risk. The diligence would be so difficult because you will never get your equity back. So in that sense, it reduces the M&A projects, and this is for Odebrecht, but we have reported this for the Solarte projects as well in Colombia. This is like a huge impact for equity M&As in pre-construction or during construction stage in particular because the project is not done yet. And so the big question is going to be, as always with these corruption cases, what is going to happen to those projects? Are they going to be canceled and retended? That takes a lot of time, money, and years. Are they going to be sold? After this court ruling, it looks like there's not going to be what the governments like to say a market solution. There's not going to be someone stepping in and putting the money and say, hey, I'm going to finish the contract anyway. And so we still have to see what the impact of this court decision is going to be, but for sure as of now, what we can say is that the market is worried and it's going to take at least a few more steps before seeing some equity transfers in the market. Great. Well, thanks for that update, Juan, appreciate it. And that's all the time we got for today. So thanks for joining us and we'll look forward to next month, breakout.

Joining us today is DJ Gribben, now a senior operating partner at Stone Peak Infrastructure Partners and also non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Formerly, he was a member of the Trump administration and chief architect behind the proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan from 2018. Thank you for joining us on today's program, DJ. John, thank you for having me. It's great to be here. Thank you. So, we might as well get right into it, as Trump and the Democratic leadership met last week to discuss a new proposed infrastructure bill. This time, the stakes clearly raised to $2 trillion. What do you think's really changed in the tea leaves here, which could or could not lead to a bill being reached this time around? So, your timing for this podcast is fantastic, because as you said, last week, we had a relatively historic moment where the President, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate Minority Leader all got together, along with other congressional leaders, and decided the target was going to be raising $2 trillion for infrastructure. While that sounds good, there are some challenges with that number, primarily the fact that no one has come up with a good way to raise $2 trillion or a trillion or half a trillion to spend on infrastructure. The second part of it is that the federal government in this country has a relatively small role to play in infrastructure. The federal government funds about 25% and owns about 8% of infrastructure in the U.S. So, having a big push from infrastructure at the national level is a bit unusual and would take the U.S. off its historic path of how it funds and develops infrastructure. If a deal is reached, what impact would that have on private investment in infrastructure? It depends on the shape and the nature of the deal. If you have a $2 trillion deal, meaning that there's $2 trillion available at the federal level to spend on what is primarily state and local infrastructure, I think that pretty much destroys the market here in the U.S. Because no elected official, if given the choice between, okay, I can raise my own funds here or I can use private equity or I can just get free funds, in essence, from the federal government. Every mayor, every governor, every county executive is going to default to option three and say, all right, let me spend all my time and effort going to the federal government trying to get more, as opposed to going through the cost and the expense and the time it takes to put together a good, robust P3 transaction in their jurisdiction. Now, on the other side of the fence, as candidates have emerged to challenge President Trump, another proposal has been making the rounds from Senator Klobuchar, which would be back to $1 trillion, but there's actually a game plan there proposed according to her. Number one would be a $650 million federal spending increase, meaning taxes would go up, and the establishment of a national infrastructure bank to fill in the gaps, which has often been talked about as well. What do you think about that proposal? Another good question. The challenge with Klobuchar's proposal is twofold. One, again, having $600 billion, whether it's for taxes or some other source, that's a hard amount to spend federally. Secondly, as you know, you can't fill the gap, a funding gap, with a financing tool. There's a fair amount of confusion in D.C. right now about the difference between funding and financing. So, you know, bonds, an infrastructure bank, private equity, these are all ways to finance revenue streams and to get the most, ideally, out of a funding source, but they're not funding. So often people confuse the fact that we'll have an infrastructure bank and that will give us money. It's like, well, you can have a bank, but you got to capitalize the bank, and then where's that capital coming from? Okay, you have to raise funds from another source to provide the capital to put in that bank. Now, you can create revolving funds, state infrastructure banks have done this across the country. So it's not necessarily a bad financing tool, but I think a lot of policy leaders get confused and think, okay, if I have a bank, then I have money. It's like, no, no. If you have a bank, you have a place to lend money from, you then have to go out and create the bank and then also capitalize that with funding, whether that's higher taxes or some other funding source. You've covered other infrastructure banks, Pan-Americas, I guess. There's established now the Canadian Infrastructure Bank run by Nikon, and then obviously down in South America, there's any number of nationalized development banks, such as BNDS in Brazil. Are any of them models for how the U.S. should think about an infrastructure bank, in your view? The challenge, again, with an infrastructure bank at the federal level is that the federal government doesn't have assets that that bank would lend to. So what the bank would do is the bank would be lending to state governments who would then be paying back the federal government. So the first threshold question would be, well, why don't you just create state infrastructure banks, which we have and are somewhat underutilized. And then secondly, a lot of people argue, I think with a fair amount of accuracy, that TIFIA, in essence, serves as this country's de facto infrastructure bank, right? Because what you want is you want the government to look at deals on a project-by-project basis, provide a subsidy that helps bridge the gap to make these projects commercial. And TIFIA has filled that role. We could argue whether TIFIA has been effective or could be more effective. One of the things that we had proposed as part of the administration's plan was expanding both TIFIA and PABS to all governmental infrastructure. So whether it's a highway, whether it's water, whether it's a port, whatever it is, if it's governmental infrastructure, it ought to be eligible TIFIA, which provides obviously subsidized credit rates at treasuries and private activity bonds, because again, another thing that's unique about the U.S. is states, municipalities who own the infrastructure have access to municipal debt market, which includes tax-exempt debt. And so what we were trying to do is say, all right, how do we, without creating another bureaucracy and another office in D.C. that everyone has to go through that will invariably promulgate lists of regulations that people have to go through and check off in order to comply with that infrastructure bank's desires, instead of doing that, let's use TIFIA, let's use PABS, let's get the same net economic effect as an infrastructure bank, but do it in a way that doesn't carry with it reams of regulations. So what became of that proposal? So the proposal was issued February 14th of last year. And at that point in time, there was not a huge enthusiastic response, because one of the challenges of infrastructure is we're swimming upstream a little bit in terms of people's expectations. So when people hear, when you go out to the American public and you say, should we have better infrastructure? Do you support that or not? Overwhelmingly, 70, 80%, people say yes. Unfortunately, most of those people say yes, because they think that someone else is going to pay for their infrastructure. And so you get into this kind of Lake Wobegon effect, where everyone thinks we're going to end up above average, where everyone will be above average, everyone will get more back from the federal government than they put in. Economic reality doesn't allow for that. And so when you start having the conversation of, do you want infrastructure, yes, are you willing to pay for it? Not surprisingly, you lose a chunk of that support. And so the proposal that we had put forth, in essence, was what we need for infrastructure, two main things. We need additional funding, and we need a permitting process that allows us to get projects up and going faster. So we had a whole section of the bill devoted to the permitting process. Probably the most important, but the dullest thing that we proposed is permitting reform. There are pieces of that that are being taken and working through the administration now, so that's pretty encouraging. On the funding side, if you expect to be given money and someone shows up and says, I'll give you an incentive for you to raise more money, that's not as appealing. So we did not meet with people's expectations, which was, hey, the federal government will just give me funds. Part of the reason why we didn't do that, and this is another kind of economic dislocation that people have when they think about infrastructure, is much of the complaint around the administration's bill on the funding side was in two different camps. The first is, there's not enough federal funding, and the federal government should spend more, because state and local governments have done their part. The second was, it relies on private equity. And as we just talked about, the second part is just flat out wrong. You can't have private equity as a funding source. It's a financing source. On the first side, it's interesting that people consider, if they consider federal funds to be separate apart from state and local, even though they're exactly the same taxpayers. So if you're living in New York and you're paying taxes to New York City, you're paying taxes to the state of New York, you're paying taxes to the federal government, you're the one paying taxes. So if New York can't spend more on infrastructure, because it would be too much burden on you, having the federal money, federal government take funds from you and then give them back to you is not a more efficient way to deliver infrastructure. So I think one thing is that we haven't had a robust conversation on infrastructure pretty much since the Eisenhower National Highway Interstate Program, right? And so people have, it's a relatively new, nascent issue area for us to be talking about at the national level. Lots of conversations at the state and local level. And so because it's relatively new, you have this disconnect between what people are expecting the policy would deliver and what, in fact, it can deliver. Well, at the state level, you know, I think after some time, we're seeing bigger projects emerge somewhere along the lines, or at least talk of it. The Hawaii LRT, which has been under a ton of scrutiny, is advancing finally in its own procurement. And through the articles we've published in information, you know, there's a possibility of both SR-400 in Georgia and I-55 in Illinois going to a P3 process, potentially large managed toll lane projects. And then, of course, Maryland's, which now has, I think, three different names, that project, but it's a $7.6 billion managed lanes project, which is going to be procured in different tranches, likely going to see numerous oppositions from local groups and lawsuits, probably, based on what we've heard so far. But it is a very large project. There's a very important need for it, as me and TJ could probably testify as former residents and current residents of Washington, D.C. and the surrounding area. But it's real. It's a process that's going to go on pretty soon. Do you have any thoughts on these projects specifically or any thoughts on state procurements getting a little bit looser this year as to what's going on there? I mean, I think it's encouraging that you have an increasing number of states are looking towards P3s as a tool to better deliver projects. Pete Rahn, who's the Secretary of Maryland, is a friend as well. He never thinks small. So he's tackling one of the worst congestion choke points in the nation. But as you mentioned, a fair amount of pushback from people who are worried about how that's going to affect their community. And are we further incentivizing using fossil burning vehicles? And so that is an area, that is a debate that needs to continue on. But I think the fact that states and localities are starting to realize that P3s offer enormous potential in terms of the ability to shift risks from the public sector to the private sector such that you get projects built on time, on budget, and delivered relatively quickly is quite encouraging. Sure. I guess the same residents could make the argument about modernizing the D.C. metro as well, which would offset then the use of fuels, but that's another argument for another day. It is. The other real positive development, and I think the true storyline for us in our coverage of P3s this year has been universities. No matter where these other state projects are, they're in their infinite stages while these university deals are actually getting done, housing projects are getting done at universities. The power plant projects, I think there's real incentive to get these projects done as well. Slightly different class of bidder potentially in terms of like who's on your team on the technical side, obviously. But universities seem to be really encouraged. You have aging dormitories, you have aging power plants, why not see what the market can give you? There's been a lot of enthusiastic response to that. What are your thoughts on this trend? Again, an encouraging trend. Universities are a great place to do P3s because their governance structure is relatively simple. Going back to the days when, so I've been doing P3s for about 20 years in the US, back to when design build warrants was really sort of cutting edge and super innovative. From my time at Federal Highways and then developing projects with Macquarie and general counsel at USDOT, one of the things I found in terms of identifying a market where there's high opportunity for P3s, it's look to the leadership. Find a place where you have an innovative leader and you have a sensible governance structure. I can mention, I probably won't call them out specifically, a number of jurisdictions in the US where you should just never go to look for a P3 because the politics of that area is so complicated, it's virtually impossible to get anything innovative through. Flip to a university and you have relatively streamlined governance and their core mission isn't providing that infrastructure service, their core mission is education. There's a lot of excitement now in the US market around airports and there should be, but one of the challenges of working with authorities is those authorities exist to run that infrastructure. You show up as a concessionaire and say, hey, listen, I can do your job better than you can do it. Let me step in and take over this part. Some of those have been done and kudos to the leaders of those institutions for acknowledging that they can bring in some experts and squeeze out additional value for their constituents. Universities don't run into that problem. They're there to do something totally different than deliver infrastructure. I think to a large degree, they're happy to see the private sector show up and take that off their plate so they can refocus on their core mission. Excellent. Another thing we've picked up on has been some of these procurements. I wouldn't say it's a new trend, to be honest, but obviously you go through a procurement and you come to a decision and you decide a design build is better than, or design bid build is better than DBFOM or a true P3. I think the Pennsylvania Broadband Project was probably a true measure of this because they decided the cost just wasn't worth it in their own procurement for doing broadband for the PennDOT. What are your thoughts on design bid or design bid build here? Is this something you think cities or states will increasingly look to, or is it just sort of project by project? Yeah. I think it will be the last project by project. You really do need a fit for purpose procurement model. If you're doing something relatively small and relatively routine, P3 obviously doesn't make a whole lot of sense. On the flip side of that, if you've got something that's unique that you've never procured before, you've never built before, it's sizable, has lots of risks, P3 will make lots of sense. All of the different procurement models in between design bid build and a full blown DBFOM should be considered depending on the size of the project, the complexity of the project, the amount of risk involved, and the private sector's willingness to incur risk for the project. One of the themes which has been harped upon, of course, is asset recycling, which has been a true driver in Australia for P3 activity and has been talked about as a benefit over here in the U.S. But again, with a lack of a lot of real P3 projects out there, it's hard to illustrate over here in the U.S. necessarily. As we were talking before we went on the air today, there was one true case of asset recycling we saw recently in a deal struck in Edison, New Jersey, between Carlyle and the city of Edison for their wastewater system, which would basically involve $100 million off-front payment. And in return, there would be nearly $500 million in terms of modernizing a water and wastewater system in Edison, New Jersey, after clearing, of course, for authorities to get to that decision. But nevertheless, $100 million goes to the city, and in return, you know, the rate payer gets hit somewhat, just a little bit of a per month surcharge for both water and sewage as a result. But, you know, what are your thoughts on asset recycling now, and, you know, what's the best use case for it in the U.S.? What do you say? Yeah, one of the best use cases is probably the first asset recycling project we had in this country was Indiana Toll Road, where Governor Daniels, for $3.8 billion, concessioned Indiana Toll Road and then took that money and reinvested it back in roads all across the state. And so for that period of time, Indiana had the only fully funded state transportation infrastructure plan in the country. So it's been done. I think the challenge with asset recycling is closely connecting the fact that, okay, we're going to give up, we, the government, are going to give up a little bit of control around this asset in exchange for a payment. And then the most important part is being very transparent and clear with the people who are utilizing that asset where that payment is going and how it's benefiting, you know, them, their community, their state, whatever it is. Just brownfield concessions are tricky, and I think they were looked at early days as just a quick cash, way to cash out some value, and that is true. If you want to build long-term sustainable support for P3s, it's very important to be transparent on the benefits of that monetization to the taxpayers involved. What do you think, you know, has been a true, just by observing the Australian model, what's been the true benefit of Australian recycling, the Australian asset recycling program over there in terms of where it's cycling back into, you know, in terms of municipality and how it applies, again, to the U.S.? I think it was very helpful in showing that, listen, the government owns these assets that have captive capital that's not being utilized for the public's benefit. In a way, that's a waste, and so, therefore, we should move that asset into a hand where we can realize that value for the public and then return that value to the public in a manner that the public desires and is politically popular. So I don't think it's overly complicated. I think that the challenge here, as you mentioned in opening the question, is there are just not that many assets that fall into this, you know, what can readily be a concession and return value. Going back to what we were talking about before in terms of airports, so you go to an airport and say, we're going to concession this whole asset, we're going to release this value, but you have to keep that value, in most cases, in the U.S. legally, you have to keep it on the airport. So you're very limited in terms of the benefits you can capture from recycling. Now, you can do a terminal, obviously, and release that value and use it to construct a better terminal or to use it for other purposes in the airport, but I think the, like, when you talk about P3s in the U.S., lots of times it cycles back to this fundamental core problem of how fragmented our ownership structure is. We have tens of thousands of water systems that are owned by different entities. We've got 3,300 counties that own all kinds of infrastructure and, obviously, 50 states. And so that super fragmented structure makes it hard to find a jurisdiction in which here's an asset that we can monetize, oh, and there's also a need in that same jurisdiction that we can take that value and bring it back to that jurisdiction in a way that the public would be supportive of. Interesting. And without even having asked the question, E.J., I noticed you mentioned airports twice in this conversation. So I'm going to conclude our discussion with airports, because that's what people like talking about. And sure, there's a $13 billion worth of projects going on at JFK. There's finally some projects gestating at LaGuardia and NORC, which would get people excited. And then after that, there's a whole lot of speculation about a lot of things, St. Louis being tangible or could be coming up soon. And then long-rumored projects. And then airports going to the ancillary services, CONRACs, and people movers, as LAX will probably tell you that. What are your thoughts on airport privatization? Is that wave coming? Or you figure, to your earlier point about authorities giving over control, that that's not going to happen? I think it's – first of all, airports are fantastic for private sector involvement, because they're shopping malls with runways, right? So no one does shopping malls better than the private sector, so it makes all the sense in the world. Plus, the customer focus, the consumer experience that the private sector can bring to these projects is sorely needed in air travel in the U.S. So there's a bunch of potential benefit there. But before you cross the speculative line, you talked about LaGuardia and JFK, NUWORK, note all the same owner. Oh, and an owner with lots of other infrastructure challenges beyond just the airport. So I think the bigger question for the U.S. is, can you move beyond the CONRACs and the people movers on airports that are not the port authority of New York and New Jersey? And I think that's an open question that's going to be hard. Certainly terminal projects help, but you're working with the same fundamental dynamic that limits the benefits of asset recycling, which is the owner of those assets has limited other places to put any value that's released from a P3. In other words, I think what we're saying is maybe you should go visit Europe to see what's possible. Don't abandon the U.S. The U.S. is a fantastic market, but it's highly fragmented, and it's hard, and it's going to require a lot of creativity. I only kid. Anyway, on that note, next month you can hear DJ Opine on today's U.S. infrastructure landscape at our own U.S. P3 conference at the 925 morning panel on June 12th at the Midtown Hyatt alongside Doug Fried of Norton Rose, Dwayne Callender of the Build America Bureau, Sam Chai of Kiewit, Naraya Haltawanger of ACS Infrastructure, Mark Bradshaw of Macquarie, and Anthony Phillips of John Lang. On that note, DJ, thanks for coming today. Really appreciate it. My pleasure, John. Thanks for having me.  Thank you. Thank you.

I'm John Burke, America's editor for information. Our intent is to deliver the world of project finance to your living room in under 30 minutes or less or get a free pizza. Joining me in today's discussion is Andrew Vitelli, reporter for information and Jonathan Carmody, news editor in for Latin America. Welcome to the program guys. So Jonathan, we start in Mexico where an interesting trend has emerged. AMLO kicked it off this year off the wrong way by just canceling a massive project in Mexico City in the airport. But all of a sudden we're starting to see signs of greenfields activity being resuscitated by municipalities, by states. So the thesis we had going into the year that greenfield activity might be dead in Mexico has been refuted a little bit by states still wanting to do good, still building things. So why don't you talk to us about some of these specific projects and sort of what's behind all this? Sure. And just to give a little bit of background, there were a couple of articles that I wrote recently about the reviews of contracts we've seen. Initially, a lot of the attention seemed to be focused on the energy and renewable projects that were tendered, including wind farms, solar plants, and gas pipelines on the concession models. Now, there's been a lot of talk from the government about how these weren't necessarily good value for money, and they wanted to review the contracts and possibly enter into voluntary renegotiations, which was a bit of an ominous term for the private sector. After that, however, we had a speech recently from Rocio Nahle, the Secretary of Energy, where she said that transmission lines in the country, as everybody knows, are incredibly saturated for electricity. So she backtracked a little bit and said that now that CENER, the Secretary of Energy, and the CFE, the Federal Electricity Commission, would possibly seek financing and associations in inverted commas, which obviously in Spanish is PPPs, Asociación Público-Privada. Now, that was a little bit more reassuring for the energy developers out there. The people I've spoken to in the market generally say that they're confident that the reviews won't find any corruption, the reviews won't overturn any contracts, and there should be an accord going forward. But as you said, what our reporter Katie Golvala has been uncovering recently is a wave of regional, municipal, and state-level PPPs that still seem to be in vogue amongst local administrations. To give you a few examples, she reported on a $300 million bypass in Ciudad del Carmen in the southeast of the country, Quintana Roo, one of the big touristic states in the Mayan Peninsula. They've got a portfolio of possibly up to four PPP projects, including a regional train system between Cancun and Tulum, a bridge across the lagoon in Cancun, a federal highway extension, and a light rail project to improve connectivity within the city of Cancun itself. It's a very ambitious and very expensive, possibly about $2 billion of projects there. Monterrey has been considering some highway renovations, including installing viaducts to try and alleviate some of the traffic. Anyone who's been to Monterrey knows that it's desperately needed. The governor of the state of Mexico submitted three PPPs to the legislature for approval, including two prisons and a highway network. So it's very interesting to see that the regional governments might pick up a bit of the slack, and investors might find opportunities down there in smaller, perhaps more humble PPPs, but perhaps more numerous. The other thing we saw previously was a large impetus on PPPs in Baja California, where they tendered out the Playas de Rosarito project. As we understand it, it's still looking for financing, but early last year in March, BlackRock actually took a 55% stake in the project, which shows some of the level of interest and the viability of these regional projects. So jumping onto that point, you've also written extensively about the rise of SERPIs, or funds, in Mexico. Do you think that's what's driving some of the state's motivations, knowing that this could be a receptive audience to this type of project? Certainly. There's a lot of capital out there that still needs to be invested from the CKDs and the SERPIs. The difference obviously being the CKDs are exclusively within Mexico, and the SERPIs can invest up to 90% outside of Mexico. Where we reported on Beale Infrastructure Partners launching a CKD for debt financing, and that's very interesting. I wasn't initially convinced that there would be enough opportunities, but they were quite reassuring in terms of the projects that are in the market. A lot of storage facilities for oil and gas. As we know, one of the big issues in Mexico is the lack of hydrocarbon storage. I think for the country as a whole, they only have three days of reserves, which in the event of some kind of oil and gas disaster, could be catastrophic for the country. So with those kind of projects, some of the PPPs and concessions that are already out there that have been awarded, still looking for financing like Rosarito, there could still be some opportunities out there for that fund. But it will be interesting to see where infrastructure funds start to allocate those resources as the federal pipeline appears to be drying up. Well, it's good to see they're building infrastructure outside of Cancun as well, as in Cancun. Anyway, from Mexico we go to the pipelines, where Andrew Vitelli has been spending a lot of time covering deals and doing an analysis piece. So Andrew, I counted up before I came in the year-to-date totals for pipeline projects that reached financial close in the U.S. and Canada. We have 11 deals. We did not have dollar amounts for every deal, but the ones we did added up to $8.5 billion. A massive amount of capital has been spent. Newcomers to the infrastructure space, such as Blackstone Infrastructure, got involved in a big deal with Tallgrass Energy. But then it's gone to the conventional guys like EQT, energy-only guys like Arclight. I believe Partners Group did a deal recently, too, that was on the debt side, I believe, with Montagi Partners. So there's a lot of people getting involved in this space. And so I'd certainly like to hear your thoughts on the dynamic behind this. Yeah, and to put that into some perspective, in 2015 there was about $4 billion, just looking at Brownfield of midstream deals in the U.S., that rose to $10 billion in 2016. And by last year, it topped $20 billion. So from $10 in 2016 to over $20 in 2018. So let's say pacing is going to exceed 2018 at this point. It looks like it. It looks like it. And it didn't seem like it was possible. But if it continues this pace, it's going to blow away last year's numbers. There are a few trends driving that. In the macro sense, you have to look at the shale revolution that has made the United States not only a huge producer of oil and natural gas, but also an exporter. And that's a dramatic change from just a few years ago, especially when you look at the exports. But when it comes to infrafunds, there is another dynamic that's been driving this, and that is changes in the ownership structure. Between 2003 and around 2013, there was a move towards the MLP structure for the ownership of these pipelines. That structure worked very well for a time, but it really required a lot of growth, tapping the equity markets a lot, and the price of oil to stay high. And in 2014, that all came crashing down. There was a sense that the MLP structure was not viable in the long term. And the infrafund structure, which really is a more patient capital structure, became a better fit. And that coincided with infrastructure funds raising massive amounts of capital and looking to deploy it, and pipelines and midstream companies became a natural fit for that capital. So that's really what we're seeing. And I think that's going to continue for the foreseeable future, really. And I guess what's interesting about this is that we came from a time, to Andrew's point, where oil prices dropped, and you saw a lot of conventional drillers basically file for insolvency because they were equipped to make money if the oil price was above $80. And then when it was at $40 or $50, they fell into bankruptcy, basically. And these are obviously massive operations, a lot of leverage involved. You know, what I'm getting to is, well, the after effect is you see all this investment going now back into midstream. And so, you know, the observation there is, well, again, oil is here to stay. They're drilling oil. There needs to be pipeline transporting this from some place to another. At the end of the day, it's a critical part of how the drilling operation works in the United States and in Canada. So I kind of think that's where the investment, why the investment dollars are flowing so rapidly into it. Obviously, your point structure makes clearly a lot more sense. A lot of the closed-end infrastructure funds we cover are structured for 10 years with two one-year extensions. There's obviously continuance funds, which allow people to continue to participate in this space if they continue to want to, you know, pursue their investment thesis moving forward past 12 years. And there's also openly listed funds that are out there as well on the market where the tenor is infinite, essentially, which is where we are with Blackstone and Brookfield, I believe. So it's sort of, to your point, a sustainable dynamic, I think. It is. And you mentioned the turmoil that the industry overall, the oil and gas industry experienced in 2014. It's worth noting that midstream companies were relatively insulated from that. You didn't see a lot, if any, bankruptcies of midstream companies. That's in part because a lot of them have take-or-pay contracts so that even if there is a slowdown in the flow of gas or of oil or gas or a decline in the price, they're still getting paid. And also, even some of these upstream companies that were in bankruptcy were still honoring their midstream contracts because they had to get that oil to market. Yeah. It's called a critical vendor. I mean, that's kind of how these things are constructed. So they're still getting paid. So when it comes to the pipelines, they are a relatively safe bet, even if there are changes to the price of oil and to those dynamics. Now there are some facilities like gathering and processing that might be a little bit more at risk if there is a dramatic change in the price of oil, if some of the upstream producers don't produce as much as they expected to. So you're seeing some of these companies creep into infrastructure portfolios. And with that, maybe a little bit more risk than we're seeing from the midstream companies. So far, there haven't been cases where it's really blown up in anyone's face, but it's something to keep your eye on. There are those in the industry that have sounded some warning bells about that. Excellent. Thank you for that. So last part of the program, we have to bring up airlines because, as Jonathan knows, it's my favorite topic in the whole wide world. We saw a development this week where global infrastructure partners, now on the precipice of closing their latest fund, hired former American Airlines executive Thomas Horton to join their group and ostensibly advise them on airports. And this follows on the heels of a couple of developments, Corsair Capital in recent months doing a continuance fund for Vantage Airport Group, and then Oak Tree forming another joint venture of their own on commercial airlines, and then Carlisle's airport group, CAG, emerging as a proponent at JFK on one of their massive renovation projects. And on the back half of that, you have a couple of Canadian deals where institutions recapitalized and bought into the airport space. So where is this all leading? I think it's going to be a major theme for us in 2019 and 2020. You have a lot of activity around New York and L.A., yes, that is true. These are real processes that have happened. And then the question is kind of then what? We have a project in St. Louis that everybody's looking forward to, and it seems to be a lot of investor interest in, and everybody's asking about, well, when's the RFQ going to get released? That's something for people to watch. And the question is, well, then what? So I feel like that's a game we're going to be playing this year, but particularly in the U.S., in terms of where these investor dollars are going to flow. But I guess the good news is that I guess the FAA at least is supporting this. They have the reauthorization bill from last year, which does give a federal subsidy. If you want to look at doing something with your airport, we'll reimburse you. So continuing that theme, Jonathan, I know you've done some work on a project that's sort of apart from the mainstream airports that are out there in Florida. So why don't you tell us about it? The Airglades International Airport Plan has been accepted as part of the FAA authorization program as one of America's first truly private airports. It's a cargo facility that looks to shift the cargo handling operations from Miami International Airport about 100 miles north, taking goods like frozen food and produce that's coming from South America all the way closer to the consumers. So if you move the airport north, you're obviously much closer to the federal highway networks that you're going to distribute to. So there's going to be cost savings involved there. They're going to have some storage facilities. They're going to be able to do customs there. We've been speaking to people close to the project, and it looks like it could be around $500 million worth of investment in building all the facilities, the runways, and everything adjacent to the project. We heard as well that they're in negotiations with several investment banks, possibly in regards to some kind of financial mandate. So we could be seeing a financing for the project in the next six to 12 months. Well, that's it for this week's edition of the podcast. So we will see you next month. Thanks for joining us.
