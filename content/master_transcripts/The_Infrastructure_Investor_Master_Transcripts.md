Hi, I'm Bruno Alves, Editor-in-Chief of Infrastructure Investor. In today's episode, I sit down with Madeline Farman, Editor of affiliate title Secondaries Investor and host of the Second Thoughts podcast, as well as America's Editor Zach Bentley, to talk about the infrastructure secondaries market. In our discussion, we track the evolution of the burgeoning infrastructure secondaries market, the asset classes, best in class pricing compared to other private markets, how LP-led deals rule by volume, but GP-led transactions end up being the most sizable, the outsized role of continuation funds in infrastructure, and much more. Hi, Maddie, Zach, welcome to the podcast. Hi, Bruno. Thank you for having me, Bruno. No, I'm very excited, actually, Maddie, because we are talking about secondaries today and infrastructure secondaries in particular, which feels like one of the hot topics of the day across private markets. And we get to have you, who's an actual expert, as opposed to Zach and I, so we can now put you on the spot and gently grill you as much as we can. So thanks very much for agreeing to this. No, thank you for having me. And the secondaries market is certainly keeping us very busy. I often joke, I wish I had five sets of hands, but it's all go, it's all go. So I mean, I think, you know, that's really where we start, isn't it? It feels, especially for those of us of a certain age, and we've been watching secondaries take off year by year, but it really seems we're at this moment of, you know, this incredibly high popularity in the wider secondaries market. So maybe we can start there, Maddie. Maybe you can frame it a bit, what you're seeing just in general in secondaries. Yeah. So if we just take a massive step back, sort of 2017-18, we really saw the emergence of a rebranded technology, continuation funds become the front and center for many managers as a way to elongate their hold of assets. And it was a question that has been asked for a long time. We saw long hold funds in areas like private equity. We saw fund to fund transfers of assets in order to keep hold of them for a longer period. And this technology has just continued to snowball from the sort of larger blue chip managers using them at that time and normalizing this technology to mid market managers, lower mid market managers, all having done their first single asset continuation fund in recent years. What was also interesting is that since COVID, really, we've seen the denominator effect become a pressing issue for many LPs out in the market. What do they want? They want liquidity from their private assets holdings. And so many of them have been coming to market and this continues. I mean, the tariff scenario in the US and elsewhere has only exacerbated this. LPs coming to market to search for liquidity, offload some of their holdings and reinvest back into private markets should they wish to. So it's a really interesting time. There's a lot of activity. And as I sort of say, keeping us on Secondaries Investor very busy at the moment. And so you're seeing essentially two sets of, you know, broadly speaking of demand levers, right? So there's the LP liquidity angle, very much of its time now. And then there's a continuation fund angle, which I guess is a bit of a GP led play, isn't it? So you're just seeing these levers getting pulled across the LPGP nexus. Absolutely. And given that LPs are looking for liquidity, managers are looking for ways to exit their assets. So a normalized continuation fund technology, whether it be a single asset fund or a multi asset fund, seems pretty attractive to a lot of people right now. Yeah. And actually, I want to deep dive a little bit on continuation funds in just a second, but just wanted to put something in front of you. So at our global summit, which we held in Berlin in March, we had several panels on infrastructure secondaries. And one of them, we heard that about 14 to 15 billion US dollars of infrastructure secondaries deal volume closed last year. And that was out of a potential 40 to 45 billion dollars. So that's like, you know, about a third of deals or something like that. So I'm curious, how does that supply demand mismatch compare with the other asset classes that you see? So I don't know if I can go into specifics necessarily of how much volume is completed versus how much potential activity there was across asset classes in a granular way. But what I can say is that the supply demand mismatch across the secondaries market is quite stark. So one of the common pieces of commentary that we hear on secondaries investor is there's just not enough capital in the secondaries market to meet the demand to sell into the secondaries market. And why is that? This is all of a sudden, to the points that we were just making earlier, a market where there's a huge amount of demand from both LPs and GPs. However, if we take continuation funds, for example, there hasn't been a huge number of exits from these transactions. And so LPs are, you know, considering whether or not they want to back a GP-led vehicle. Obviously some LPs out there definitely do, because we've seen some large fundraisers, but it's not a broad swathe of investors that definitely want to invest. So what does that mean? It means that ultimately, managers and LPs can come to market wanting to do a deal, and they might come out with a deal that is particularly sizable, or on the LP side, a portfolio that is particularly sizable, but they might not necessarily be able to get all of that done in the secondaries market, just because of that supply-demand mismatch that we see across the market, not infrastructure specific. Just to add to that, I was speaking to a large secondaries player recently that's an LP and a lot of GP-led continuation funds, and they were just saying that in some of the more major transactions we'd see in the infrastructure space, you'd find them and a lot of the other blue chip names we'd all know in this market, they'd all be in those continuation funds, because they can only each invest a certain amount in these funds, and you find a kind of who's who in all of them. And still sometimes the GP is struggling to garner all the capital up just because of the supply-demand imbalance and usually the size of the single asset continuation funds. So just to jump to pricing, again, in Berlin we heard that discounts of around 8-10% were kind of emerging as the price for liquidity and infrastructure secondaries. There's this report from Greenhill saying infrastructure secondaries scored the strongest pricing I believe among strategies in 2024, and that was averaging around 94% of net asset value. Yeah, Maddy, if you're in a position to do a bit of a look across asset classes, how does that discount to NAV compare? How does the pricing look like compared to other asset classes? So yes, I've got the same report sitting in front of me, Greenhill obviously putting infrastructure secondaries pricing at 94% of net asset value for funds out in the market last year. It is by far and away the best-priced secondary strategy. Over last year and the course of the last five years or so. It's interesting, I think we look at the next asset class sitting there, private credit is sitting at 89% of NAV and buyouts, the most popular asset class traded in the secondaries market sitting at 87% of NAV. So if we take a look at the Greenhill report and why they say infrastructure funds are pricing so well, they say infrastructure funds continue to be appealing to secondaries buyers due to their combination of stable cash flows, inflation protection and valuation upside potential. So particularly in the market that we see now, obviously those things are going to be incredibly interesting to a secondaries buyer. I think what's interesting is when we look at pricing in the secondaries market, it creates a little bit of a strange dynamic. So if pricing is so good, is that the most interesting strategy where you could be as a secondaries buyer the most competitive compared with your peers? Can you offer the strongest pricing here or is there an interesting area where you could find a discount in the infrastructure secondaries market? So I think there's all sorts of dynamics at play here and I'm sure the secondaries market is trying to filter through where it can be competitive and where it might find sort of off-diary, off-market, interesting transactions where it can really showcase to its investors that it's found a good investment at a discount and their peers will not get a look in whatsoever. I'm sure that's happening. Yeah, I mean Maddie will be quite used to the secondaries industry and the wealth of data that comes out, but just to maybe even slightly more optimism from the recent Campbell Lutyens report, infrastructure trading last year at 96%, buyouts at 94% and then you had sort of venture at 75% and real estate at 73%. And I think not only that, Hamilton put it into a very nice digestible graph where infrastructure's discount has never slipped below 95% according to this report, whereas the other asset classes have sort of much more up and down. So it is this stable portfolio protection role that people are looking for their infrastructure portfolios. It's sort of coming to bear when you look at the secondary market. Yeah. Of course, this is not this simple, but I do wonder if from an LP point of view, Maddie, and you can jump in, if I can get this full price and I need some liquidity, then maybe I go here first to sell some of this stuff because I get my 95%. Of course, the flip side to that is I may not be over allocated or even close to that, in which case I don't want to sell it. But do you think it creates a little bit that temptation because you do seem to get very close to 100% there? We've certainly seen portfolios come to market where people are looking to sell a wide range of different asset classes. Obviously, as you say, Bruno, if you're able to get very compelling pricing on an infrastructure portfolio, that is certainly an area where you might look to divest some of your holdings, right now. I think the other interesting dynamic that we're seeing is selling some infrastructure stakes as part of an overall private markets portfolio could offset some of those discounts that you might see in venture capital, for example. Secondaries buyers are often thinking, right, I'll mix and match with some harder to price, slightly less compelling fund stakes, if you can offer something that's going to be very compelling at the upper end of the market. We can find a sweet spot whereby maybe we can offer an effective price that you're happy to take as the seller. Obviously, that's a very simplified knockdown of how these secondaries buyers look at these transactions, but you'll get the gist from that explanation, I'm sure. I think definitely LPs will be looking at their infrastructure portfolios as part of that overall, what does our portfolio composition look like and how do we reach an attractive price in order for us to green light a sale? But I'd be curious to know what you both are seeing in terms of how infrastructure compares with other asset classes and what LP appetite is for infrastructure right now. Well, not to give too much of a spoiler for our July-August cover, but this is what we're looking at. I think one of the prevailing themes coming out, it is this sort of protection status that I was talking about before, the other asset classes, you might get much higher returns, but have seen a lot more volatility in the past three, four, five years, whereas infrastructure broadly has remained the same. And I think that bears through to what you're talking about here. And just in terms of, we started the podcast by talking about, again, how we're seeing secondaries coming at it from the LP side, from the GP side. And I think I'm right in saying that some asset classes, LP leds, maybe tend to dominate. Some others, it may be slightly different. Maybe Zach, I remember you did a round table on this last year on secondaries, that is infrastructure secondaries. Do we have a sense here of where we fit infrastructures and asset classes? Is it mostly GP leds that dominate? Is it nicely split? Is it LP leds? What have you heard? The understanding that I have from the data that's provided and from speaking to people is that the bulk of the activity is LP led, but sort of where you see the big ticket items is in the GP leds, in those continuation funds. I'd be interested to hear what goes on in these continuation funds outside of infrastructure, but we're usually looking at really high ticket items, sort of some of those large scale data center platforms, or sort of in GIP's case, a couple of times airports, which go for very high transaction costs. Maddy, out of curiosity, what do you hear about infrastructure in terms of this GP LP led balance, but also how does it, again, if possible, compare with other asset classes? Is it more or less all the same in terms of dynamics, or are you seeing different things at play here? I think it's really interesting on the GP led side of the infrastructure secondaries market. I have heard the same things as Zach, obviously, the LP led market in terms of the amount of deal flow that we see, and the numbers of deals getting done is sort of surpassing the GP led side of the market. However, the GP led side of the market, while the number of deals is fewer, these transactions are very sizable. And I think, ultimately, it comes down to the fact that, obviously, as you both will know very, very well, the underlying assets that are part of these GP led transactions are sizable in and of themselves. To the point that I made earlier, there is a supply, demand, and balance problem. There's only so much capital available to invest in infrastructure secondaries. But in terms of the art of the possible as to how large these get, this infrastructure secondaries market is an area that we look at intensely to see how large are these deals, what types of structures they're using, and what demand is like, both from the secondary side as well as investors into, and the GPs themselves in the infrastructure secondaries market. Yeah. I definitely think continuation funds are one of the more interesting technologies to have emerged. And I think they will play an outsized role in infrastructure when it comes to GP leds, if only on size alone. Okay, I need to get one thing out of the way. This is maybe an old perception. Let's put it that way. But I'm sure you both will remember that when these first vehicles emerged, the perception was that they served as a bit of a dumping ground for poorly performing assets. I'm guessing that perception has left the building or not quite? Or is there still a little bit of a cloud hanging on continuation vehicles? Yeah, no, absolutely, Bruno. So I think, obviously, the genesis of continuation funds was, you know, they were used as the technology was used to restructure zombie funds, essentially. So funds that were hobbling along in their life, LPs wanted their money out, the manager wasn't able to raise a new fund, and there was essentially stranded assets. The continuation fund technology was essentially a rebrand of that. So a number of high quality blue chip managers raising continuation funds for their star performing jewel in the crown assets. And so I think it's understandable that people still perceive that this technology is or was used for as a dumping ground for assets. But ultimately, what's the check on this? The check is the secondaries market itself. So again, I feel a bit like a broken record, but there is a supply demand imbalance. There's only so much capital that secondaries buyers can invest into deals that come across their desk. And they are going to be looking for the best performing assets, the best deals that they can get done at pricing that is attractive for their funds. And ultimately, that means that these need to be good assets with a good trajectory. These secondaries buyers have their own limited partners, and they're not being mandated to go out and essentially buy rubbish that won't perform well. So the secondaries market acts as the check on whether or not a good performing asset will go into it. And they have their own check there, the limited partners who want to see returns on their investments when they hand over checks to these buyers. So are there, will there be some continuation funds that don't perform well? Absolutely. But they have been underwritten to a high standard and those secondaries buyers will be expecting good returns. Yeah, and hopefully that really functions as a check. I would say anecdotally, I think just LPs are much more aware of this now than maybe they weren't in the past. And so they're a bit more suspicious when a continuation fund comes to be presented to them. But I think that also the GPs know that this is this is not something that you can just dump anymore that what we see going into.

### Actis: Investors need to think of growth markets as ‘most markets’

**Episode ID:** 2591

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Alves and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Torbjörn Siser, Chairman and Senior Partner at Global Mid-Market Manager Actis. Actis has been investing across energy, digital, and new economy real estate in the world's growth markets for more than 20 years, or as Torbjörn likes to call them, most markets given they represent over 85% of the world's population. We discuss why perception risk is still the main impediment to channeling more LP capital into these markets, why the current volatility does not change the immense need for critical infrastructure, how demand offers the strongest risk mitigation, which markets offer the best opportunities and much more. Hi Torbjörn, welcome to the podcast. Great to be here, Bruno. So we're at this moment in time when it feels like old notions are being turned on their head a bit. So we have significant volatility originating from the US, which is a premier OECD market, and the kind of volatility that rightly or wrongly, many people actually associate with some of the growth markets that Actis traditionally invests in. So my first question to you is, are you seeing any change in mindset, particularly amongst LPs, towards the growth markets you invest in? I mean, it's clearly a topic of the last couple of weeks, or many weeks, I guess, the whole, you know, volatility and what does that mean for us as an investor, you know, both Actis, but also, you know, in the bigger picture. So it's a big discussion. But I think one thing coming out of that is that there are uncertainties here. And we don't really know exactly where the tariffs will land. But uncertainty, I think, then that drives the question of diversification. And then diversification, I would say, away from the US market or their dependence on that. And the other one is maybe having done more of infrastructure, which clearly has that stable contracted cash flow characteristics. And if you add the two of them, you know, going to the non US, non European markets where we are focusing in infrastructure, I think, actually, we are one of the great beneficiaries of this. So this has been one of the key discussions with our LPs the last many weeks. I guess the flip side to this, if I'm playing a bit devil's advocate, is you put all of this volatility in the mix and all of this uncertainty. And then you get people thinking, well, actually, some of these growth markets may be more vulnerable to the current environment. And thus, you know, I'm already a little bit as an LP afraid of going into them. And now I'm even more afraid. So I'm wondering if you're seeing some of that, too. Yeah, I mean, I would say no. And I think that if you're looking at it, yes, if you look at North-South trade, and that can have some implications clearly towards US and European markets. But if you look at the South-South trade, I mean, there's no new tariffs between Brazil and China or between Mexico and India or, you know, so that trade, which has overtaken the North-South trade many years back and is growing much faster, that is stronger than ever. And if you're looking at that for those markets with the non-US and non-European ones, you know, most of the world, I would call it, in a way, 85% of the world population lives, I think trade and growth that underpins the need for critical infrastructure is growing more stable than ever. Yeah. And in a way, I'm guessing that story is perhaps coming out to the forefront a bit more than. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So Adrian, you've been doing this for many, many years, and we've been sort of talking about the industry and how can capital move into these growth markets when traditionally it's always concentrated in the markets, the traditional OECD markets. So if I ask you now in 2025, what is the main impediment or the main impediments to us seeing more infrastructure capital flowing to some of these markets? What's on the list? Yeah. So I think the number one is probably perception, perception of risk versus real risk, but I think it's changing. I think that we see more capital coming to most of the world, so the non-US and non-European markets. I think we then see more competitive capital coming, and we welcome that, and we want more capital into these markets. So I think then that the South-South trade and the fundamental growth that is happening there, and this is, you know, you build, produce, and consume critical infrastructure locally is, you know, less dependent on, therefore, tariff discussions and the likes. And I think that simplistic view of where, therefore, fundamental investment needs are, I mean, people get it. And I think, therefore, the perception of risk is slowly changing, and I think more capital is coming into these markets. On that note, actually, in terms of risk management, one tool that seems to be gaining in popularity is blended finance, and actually I'm seeing it grow in popularity in a private fund, private capital context, actually, because it's obviously been around in other instruments for quite a while. But in this private fund context, what do you make of its growing use to channel investments into these markets? I mean, in some ways, I mean, there are some markets I think that that may be relevant, but where we invest, it's not needed. I mean, in my 30-plus years in this, or 35 years in investing, I've never seen a bankable deal not getting capital. So I think it is some sort of a misunderstanding that you can solve everything by just having more capital flowing in. That's just not what is needed. There's plenty of capital, you know, available on the planet, and it will flow to the best risk returns when it's there. So if you structure deals in the right way, capital is there. So the question of getting capital to, you know, certain parts of the world, I'm not sure subsidy is the right tool, actually. I think it's much more making sure that you have the resources and all the people with the right competences to create, therefore, structures which are transparent, you know, without an uncertainty, and capital will flow. So you cannot avoid that and then just flood it with subsidized capital. So I don't think that is a solution. There might be some markets where you want to have some more aid money to flow in to get economies going, but clearly, you know, most of the world outside the US and Europe is a big place, and we are not in those markets. We are in markets where you have fundamental needs for infrastructure, and people are very happy to pay for it. Yeah. Do you think there's a little bit of a, to go back to your earlier comment about perception as an impediment into doing business in these markets, is this almost a sometimes blended finance a little bit of an expensive solve for the mind, a little bit of expensive reassurement then for people to just get comfortable? That's my opinion. Yes. Okay. I also wanted to ask you this at the time we're recording, you've you've actually just the day before, you've just announced the close of your your second long life infrastructure fund. And it's focused on operational assets, you know, in many of these markets. And I always thought that that is actually maybe a very good way of getting people comfortable with some of these markets, because you take some of the greenfield risk out of the equation. Here are these operating assets, they've got a track record and so on and so forth. And you're at your second time around. So I just want to ask you to share a bit how people are thinking about that product and then whether you see further growth for similar products. Yeah. I think you're right. If you're looking at I mean, it's our second product. So the core of what we do, you can say we are builders, we are builders and operators, we construct new infrastructure, you know, that gap of supply and demand for infrastructure and therefore get that that new capital to come in to actually create new infrastructure. That said, clearly over time, we've seen that there is now an installed base of existing infrastructure where someone like us can come in and actually do quite a good job of improving existing cash flows and therefore drive the returns up. And you're right, those type of investments, the perception of risk there is lower because I mean, they're already built and operating and cash flows are flowing. And I think here is a fantastic opportunity in the sense that, you know, this is core or core plus infrastructure where we can generate value add returns because of the mismatch between supply and demand of opportunities and supply and demand of capital. So it's clearly is a way of coming into these markets on a lower risk yielding proposition. We are at a moment where everybody is focused on DPI, everybody is focused on exits. And so maybe for the listener that is less familiar with some of these markets, could you give an overview of your exit experience in some of these markets? Yeah, I mean, if you look at the last 23 years here and the various funds we had, I mean, we've done a total of 200 exits. So we clearly have an experience of exiting transactions. And I believe we are, you know, top quarter, top deficit in terms of getting DPI back to our investors. So I would say well-structured transactions, you know, do have a real need for new, you know, GPs and others who want, strategics who wants to come in and own these assets. So we haven't seen a lack of buyers and therefore a issue with exits really. And it probably comes then from that, you know, more capital coming into our markets and therefore there is an inflow. And if there is therefore, should we say a shortage of quality assets that someone like us have built, clearly we can then, you know, sell that in a pretty, pretty good way into that demand for assets that we created. And that's actually, that was going to be my next question, so I'm just going to ease into it. But that the people or the institutions you exit to, surely you've seen a change over the years, right? Precisely because you now have, let's call it some of the more traditional blue chip managers also going into these markets. So how would you peg the evolution of the capital you now exit to? Yeah, I mean, we've seen a broader group of, you know, exit routes that, you know, that we can exit to. So if you go back some 20 years back, I mean, I think it were clearly strategics and there were global strategics in the power space as we are focusing on power specifically. Over time we saw regional power companies and regional strategies come in as exit routes. And I think it's the latest is that we have funds, big infrastructure funds interested in our markets and the assets that we are creating and the companies that we are building. So yes, it's been a shift. And I think that that just gets us, you know, the broader set of potential ways of exiting. You know, when it comes to infrastructure as an asset class, we talk a lot about the sanctity of contracts, even though there's been significant volatility in OECD regulated assets. You often make the point, as you've done here already, that there is a supply demand gap that exists in growth markets that kind of works as the best risk mitigation you could ever have. And so I'm just wondering, again, for people less familiar with these markets, maybe you can just explain a bit better what you mean by this. Yeah, I mean, I think that supply and demand drives everything in life in many ways, right? It drives risk, it drives returns, risk return and the like. So if we're looking at the non-US and non-European markets, that's where you have 85% of the world population. That's because of demographics, urbanization and the likes and economic growth. I mean, you have some 90% of economic growth going forward in those markets. And two thirds, or actually about 70% of all needs and opportunities in infrastructure and in power specifically is in these markets, the non-US and non-European markets. But at the same time, the majority of the capital, two thirds, give or take, is focusing on bidding each other up in the US and Europe. So to be in markets where two thirds of the opportunities are and only one third of the capital chasing it, that creates an absolute fantastic risk return prospect where you are. And I also think that drives the fundamental risks. Because if you have a product that everyone wants, it's in a short supply, electricity is a critical infrastructure in a country, people will pay for that. If they don't need the product, if there's an oversupply of electricity, first at that time will people start looking at contracts, do I really need to and how about this and that? And yes, I need to deliver now renewable energy into an oversupply German market or what have you. But that just doesn't happen if you have a shortage of the product you're selling. So I think that mismatch between supply and demand, opportunity and capital is fundamental in looking at risk analysis. And I think it's much more important in every project that we look at than the contract. Of course, we look at the contract and that they are there and that we have the legal structure and so on around it. But fundamentally, it's to have a product that people really, really want. And do you feel that need in a way sort of insulates against, let's say, major contractual changes or major ups and downs, so to speak? No, no, I really do. I think that, you know, again, if you have a client who is very keen to get your product, they will pay. They will not look at the contract and saying that, I mean, of course, they will follow the contract, but they're very keen to have a relationship with you where you provide that critical infrastructure and they pay for it. They are in desperate need of it. And that is always the best risk mitigant. We're likely entering into a period of, let's call it prolonged inflation. And even though infrastructure is good inflation hedging capabilities, I think there's always a question of affordability once inflation is sticky and it's constantly there. So all of what you've been saying makes a lot of sense and is true about how demand is strong and thus what you build is needed. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about persistent inflation and affordability is a key concern, because I'm guessing that in some of these markets, affordability is more front of mind, perhaps, than in some of the other ones. I mean, you know, the whole most of world universe, non-US and Europe is clearly not just one uniform markets. It's very different markets in there. So it can be different pictures in different parts of the world. But if we're looking at specifically the affordability question, you can say the most expensive power is no power. So if you don't have reliable power, that is the most costly of everything, right? So I think, therefore, the willingness to then pay for critical infrastructure and specifically electricity, you know, it's there because it is more expensive not to have it. Yeah, that makes sense. And Torbjörn, as you've mentioned, you know, being builders several times here. So again, in this particular period with some of the, again, the increased costs and the supply chain disruption we've had for a while, and it's likely getting worse. How are you as a builder being affected? How are costs for your projects changing, increasing? Talk us a little bit through that. Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, you can say have a deglobalization that you're referring to there. And you can say the tariffs has a negative impact in general of growth. However, you're looking at these economies again, you know, if you're in Southeast Asia and you have six, seven, eight percent, you know, economic growth set, there are local growth activities happening there. They need critical infrastructure. And again, as I said, we build and, you know, you use and consume electricity and critical infrastructure locally. So it's a very local activity from that point of view. Then you can say, are the global supply chains, are they changing a little bit? Yeah. I don't know what some of them are, but I think that there's more the global EPC supplies that then deliver, you know, the power plants and the likes, you know, they will then localize their production. So I see a very positive picture nevertheless here in terms of the need for critical infrastructure in the markets where we invest. And it's true, when you tend to talk about growth markets, you know, sometimes you make this mistake of talking about it as a, you know, rest of the world type of thing. You're in a pretty good position to actually take us on a little bit of a tour here. And so, again, for listeners that may be less familiar, tell us in which regions you are seeing the most opportunities and also across which sectors? Thank you. Yeah. So growth markets, or I'd like to call it most markets, because that's where most markets is probably more accurate. So if you look at it, I mean, clearly Latin America has been an area where we invested significantly in the past, and we see lots and lots of opportunities there. If you then, you know, move Eastern Europe, where you have both, you know, a need for energy and also energy security coming in there as an important element in that whole area. India. India has been one of our success stories, and that is just continuing, you know, forward big, big, big time. The need and the structure in that market is also very attractive to us as investors. And I would say Southeast Asia. So we're doing a number of things here in Southeast Asia lately. So it's really across the globe. And if you look at the sectors, I mean, our focus is number one is electricity and power. The other one is digital. And I think that if you're looking at digital and power, they somehow come together a little bit over time here now, because if you look at, say, data centers, I mean, the need for electricity there is very significant. And that need, you know, is more and more also for green energy. And if you then are a leader in the electricity space in our markets, and you therefore know and understand how you actually can secure that power to those data centers and to that digital side of the infrastructure space.

### Partners Group: ‘LPs need more regular liquidity than some historical strategies can offer’

**Episode ID:** 2592

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Alves, and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Esther Piner, Global Head of Infrastructure at Swiss private markets firm Partners Group. We cover a broad range of topics, including the recent Iberian blackout and the importance of resilience, how to invest through the current volatility, why managers have to think of a world where LPs need more regular access to liquidity, and how persistent inflation could threaten the asset class's diversification benefits. Hi, Esther, welcome to the podcast. So at the time we're recording this, it's been just over a week since a blackout left over 50 million people in the Iberian Peninsula without electricity. I was actually in Lisbon at the time and spent roughly 11 hours with no power. So this whole topic is still kind of very much front of mind for me. And I feel we need to start there in a way. So as an industry, we've been talking a lot about the need to modernize the grid over the years. So I'll caveat my question to you by saying, we don't yet fully know the causes of the Iberian blackout. But when you learned about the blackout, Esther, did it come as a surprise? Or was it the kind of event that you expected was bound to happen? And now it did? Good question. And actually quite an interesting challenge also for infrastructure in terms of what scenarios do we need to think and operate within? And what's the sort of the size of the tails, right? Because I guess spontaneously, I'd say, what we were looking at the Iberian context, probably in hindsight, the analysis will support that this was a tail end outcome. And the question we now need to ask ourselves, how fat are those tails? And therefore, what's the frequency of risk of this reoccurring? Again, it invites the question of how much from an overall system perspective, is the system prepared and able to spend in order to mitigate or preempt the effects of those blackouts or of a similar blackout, should it be reoccurring? Now, am I surprised to see a blackout? No. My first thought that was triggered when I heard about it really was going back to probably five, six, seven years ago, when we were debating within the team, the question of grid flexibility and grid resilience, which actually ultimately led to our investment decision to build out the Green Neck Interconnector between the UK and Ireland. It was actually a couple of smaller insignificance, but still at the time, pretty significant blackout events that triggered our increased interest in the importance, the relative importance of fast acting relief valves or sort of frequency balancing mechanisms, which ultimately need a connector is in the same way as, for example, a slow spinning gas turbine can be, or even a battery can be synthetically, but really it was a couple of years ago that we were observing a fundamental change in grid architecture ultimately. And I guess on the back of that thematic conviction, not only did we invest in Greenlink, in a number of different cross technology-based energy flexibility platforms across the world, but then also in adjacent infrastructure sectors. So our May cover story on Infrastructure Investor was actually about resilience, funnily enough. You took part in it graciously, and you made a couple of comments that actually caught my eye and that I wanted to discuss further here. One was about data centers, paraphrasing you said something to the effect that they appear to have some of the best contractual provisions when it comes to resilience. And maybe for the benefit of our listeners, what are they doing right? And what do these contracts look like when it comes to risk allocation? So what triggered that conversation was actually another incident that I think was widely reported in the international press, I think also really impacted a lot of people's lives directly. And that was a consequence of the substation fire nearby West London. And it was interesting to see because you look at Heathrow as an energy consumer, and I think it's in the scale of about 30 to 40 megawatts, give or take of energy consumption. And you look at within literally the same system, you have a number of the large data center operators housed with pretty significant load centers. Again, you're looking probably at 5, 10, 15, 20 megawatts of capacity consumption. And it was really, really interesting as the news was unfolding around Heathrow, just watching these two sides of the same trigger event, the data center industry being now so focused on energy and baseload energy, and the sustenance of that baseload energy, observing that that has led to data center resilience planning being a fundamental necessity for large scale data center consumers. And that goes to both double, in some cases, triple redundancies when it comes to grid connections. It goes to onsite backup generation as well. And the industry essentially having standardized that to a very large degree, both in terms of what's required on the asset side, but then also how one prices those resilience layers. It was just very, very interesting to see both of that in play, right? Here's one industry that derives a lot of its value chain directly from the monetization of energy. And on the other side, you have an infrastructure asset, which has the availability of energy as a key input component. Yet the value chain that hangs on the other side of it hasn't either recognized the necessity of that resilience, or potentially, and it goes back to the affordability question, when you look at how the infrastructure is priced, is there room to pay the bill for this fat end? Just to pause on affordability for a second, you make that point now also in the story when it comes to these core regulated assets, a bit grayer, who is going to pay for that and for events that happen every once in a while. And I'm guessing maybe it's a complicated thing to pass that on to rate payers or put the mechanisms in place. Is it just a matter of hyperscalers are deep pocketed in a way that people are not when it comes to rate payers and passing on the cost? If I take a step back and I look at regulated schemes, I think it would be fair to say there's virtually no or very few developed global economies that haven't found a way to get rate payers to subsidize a policy shift on the energy mix. And you can, of course, argue just like that is designed to address a long term risk and a long term significant society cost. In the end, insured and paying the cost of that insurance, if we think about it from a risk transfer way on the security of supply and resilience side, could and should work to the same dynamics, right? Because just like I'm today willing and able as a society to allocate essentially a shift to a renewable energy mix for a consequential reduction in emissions and therefore a limitation of climate change effects to broader society. I think in an equal sort of argument, there should be a case to be made that if we want to ensure the same quality of operational readiness of our infrastructure, you know, in a more volatile world, then that also, again, under the same mechanisms could be passed on to the rate payer. I think what runs against that, and that's also why we see some pushback now, political pushback, individual pushback, individual fatigue on, you know, what is sort of more widely denoted as ESG or wokeness is because we have affordability issues and we have prioritization issues around that affordability. So my main observation would be that it's quite a complex situation where certainly the cost of us being able to operate to the same resilience and reliability levels that we've gotten used to in certainly in Europe and I think to large parts also in North America, you know, undoubtedly that cost is under a lot of pressure now and that's a derivative of more expensive supply chains and it's a derivative of more volatile events around grids and around generation. You know, you've just mentioned volatility and it strikes me that we're again going through one of those moments when there's a lot of volatility in the system. I mean, we have trade wars and tariff talk and all the uncertainty that comes with a particular moment. And so I wanted to ask you, how are you at, you know, Partners Group in general, the infrastructure team in particular, how are you approaching this moment? How is it informing your decision making? I think volatility per se is both a risk and an opportunity on the investment side. We find as we go through again volatile periods and backtestos, on balance, infrastructure portfolios do maintain a much better liquidity profile than, say, a comparable private equity portfolio, no matter whether it's a sort of geopolitically induced or trade induced or indeed COVID-induced volatility. And that's actually a very, very nice feature of infrastructure. And again, I think for me as an industry, we're still quite a young industry, we've probably been as a specific asset class around 20 or 25 years, right? But to now be able to look back on a couple of events and saying actually from a risk downside protection perspective, the continued income generation, the continued cash flow generation of an infrastructure aspect of your portfolio holds up. And I think we would also come out of the volatility with infrastructure being a more significant part of any private investment portfolio. And I would give a positive forward looking, I guess it's either a bet or an ambition, one of the two. But you look at the large part that a real estate allocation would historically have made up of what people would call a model portfolio for a de-risk but still return focused investment strategy. And I do believe we'll see infrastructure content replacing more and more the other real asset content in portfolios. So that per se is a really good starting point. Now I think the second point around volatility is it opens up opportunity. Because in a volatile world, capital allocation changes for reasons that are more decoupled from underlying fundamentals than you have in a less volatile world. I, for example, would point to geopolitical tension. Geopolitical tension also leads to redirection of investment flows. And large shifts from one part to another leave opportunity or some gaps that if you look at the right assets and the right investments, you know, that can actually allow you to invest, build, operate great infrastructure, earn a great return, not necessarily adding significant risk. But for example, you look at generational technologies and you look at the way we started this conversation around how could you potentially address the question of grid resilience? And you know, whether I ultimately take a battery technology to do that, or I take a dispatchable gas technology to do that, that's an affordability question. And in some ways, you can co-locate both, utilizing a grid access infrastructure. And that allows you to play a different set of sort of outcomes, depending by which the broader system says, I value, for example, a significantly lower carbon dispatch. And maybe for that, I need to allow for battery supply chains to again, be more affordable. Because that's, I think, the part on the renewable chain that I think is currently most at risk to be impacted on the tariff side, or, you know, today, actually, the question is more one of dispatchable energy fast, in which case your existing gas infrastructure is going to be getting dispatched more. And then the question is, over time, as maybe the perception of you and the carbon pricing also changes, you still have the optionality to then very quickly scale up with an alternative technology, where you're essentially lowering the CO2 intensity of your energy installation. So it's back to where does the value sit? And what is the scarce commodity? And the scarce commodity, I think, has gone from, I put the next megawatt into the grid to I have the ability to put megawatts into the grid in a flexible fashion, i.e. the grid, the underlying grid connection, I think, today holds a much, much more significant value. And I think if you build optionality in an individual investment, and then you build optionality in the way you put your portfolio together, so that you are diversified across different regulatory environments, across different geographies, and potentially also across different infrastructure sectors, I think you'll be able to navigate this volatile environment quite well, actually. Let me ask you about what this environment obviously kind of makes harder, let's say. For example, I'm thinking, I think I'm right in saying that platform building has long been at the heart of your strategy at Partners Group. And obviously, you know, we've been having supply chain headaches for quite a while. Now there's tariffs and the idea of development becoming costlier. For example, the other day, we spoke to an LP source who told us basically that they were looking nowadays for significant operational capacity among development platforms as sort of an imperative for them to even look at deals. So, you know, is this aspect, I am guessing, has become harder to execute on? But I'm curious how you view it. Is this a momentary thing? And how are you, you know, hedging what's been kind of a core part of your strategy? I think fundamentally, if we stay with energy for a minute, or also consequently with data centers, I think you see some of the same dynamics. There's just such an excess demand that is so intense for the next 12, 18, 24, 36 months that we're finding today. It's less about the impairment of the unit economics, which, you know, would lead to you pausing platform development. In fact, it's more who can navigate supply chains, not for the lowest price, but for the fastest time. And that's different, right? Because everybody ultimately has more or less the same pricing environment when it comes to the supply chain. You can do some optimizations, but it's hardly going to so significantly differentiate you that you can keep that benefit for two, three, four, five years. But speed, timing, execution focus, ability to really plan and execute on a project timeline. There, having done it a few times, working with, again, industry experts, overlaying experience from other projects, other platforms to a new one can help unlock and speed up the bringing of new capacity quite a lot. And that tends to be often in volatile environments, something that's actually thought after, because that allows you to, in a very short ownership period, build up a significant operating business with and still a growth avenue on top of it. And just like you said, actually, we're finding now we had one disposal of such a platform here in Europe late last year. We're actually finding that in a market that's otherwise a little bit less bullish when it comes to valuations, these types of setups right now actually attract an over-proportionate amount of buyer interest, right? So in some ways, I would say you absolutely and always need to have an operating element. But the other thing you absolutely need to ensure now is the operational capabilities and the experience to scale these platforms fast. And if you combine those two, you're ultimately almost manufacturing then that type of content that will continue to attract buyers going forward as well. I have a couple of last questions for you, Esther. One is, I think you've alluded to what could be, again, a good outcome for the asset class out of this period of volatility. But in the current moment, when you're having conversations with your LPs, for example, what are you hearing? Are you hearing about people continuing allocating as they planned? Are people talking about hitting the pause button? I think the infrastructure asset class as a whole has had a tremendous boost when inflation was low and rates were low. And that's led to a proliferation of allocators doubling and tripling down into the asset class. And it's also led to a mushrooming of different strategies, different managers to then collect and deploy that capital. And what we're now seeing in a world where rates are elevated, inflation is significantly elevated, is allocators have less to allocate, period. They therefore, for I think the first time for infrastructure, rather than being net increasing allocations, they're saying, yes, I will make new allocations. But in turn, either I need to see significant distribution that I can recycle because I don't have as much of a growing portfolio or, you know, I'm looking at the universe of managers, the universe of partners I've worked with, and I'm starting to shift. So I think in infrastructure now, there's more of a re-evaluation of portfolios that is ongoing than ever before. Good in some ways, because it opens up different access points to the asset class with more and more secondary volumes coming to the market. But also, I think we'll put continued pressure on GPs to sort of be clear and differentiated on where they play and where they do not play. And then again, I think an increasing bifurcation of track record. Differentiation. And there, I think we're in the very early stages of seeing that play out because in some ways you look at.

### Slower dealflow is forcing people to think outside the box
**Publication Date:** 2025-05-07 06:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2593

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Alves and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Natalie Tidman, editor of Infrastructure Investor Deals and Zach Bentley, America's editor at Infrastructure Investor. We discuss the deal landscape in Europe and the US, including how the market is responding to the current volatility, what's behind plotting M&A processes, which sectors are capturing investor interest on both sides of the Atlantic, why investors are growing cautious about investing in platforms with early stage pipelines and much more. This podcast is all about deals. For some of our listeners that may not be aware, we've launched a new product at the end of January. It's called Infrastructure Investor Deals, and as the name indicates, it's all about deals. Basically the deals that are done by a large chunk of our audience of fund managers and direct investors. And so I'm really happy to have Natalie who edits that title here with us today. And I'm going to start with you, Natalie, because you wrote quite an interesting piece where basically, and I think this was more maybe from a European M&A perspective, but you were basically saying that infrastructure deal makers kind of have bitter headaches than tariffs and the trade wars, and that there's kind of a slow pace to deal flow, but this isn't necessarily coming from the current volatility. So maybe we'll start there and just tell us a little bit what's happening and what you're seeing. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's right in a nutshell. I think that sort of canvassing people in the market about what their bigger headaches are and what's keeping them up at night is not so much to do with tariffs and what's happening over in America and how that's feeding into the deal market. And sure, there is certainly a level of uncertainty brought by the fact that we're living in times of extreme volatility, but I think everyone's kind of got used to that volatility to a certain extent now. So it's a bit less, people are a bit less panic stricken about it, perhaps. I think just in terms of what the infrastructure community is saying, really, I think one of the biggest issues, and this is also bred from uncertainty, really, is the frustration brought about by sale processes, which have started, but then they maybe don't move at a quick enough pace for whatever reason, or they get mandated on a deal on the advisory side and then no one hears anything for quite a while. Do you have a sense, Natalie, if this is, I know the causes will be different, but in this European M&A context, the usual, you know, seller-buyer gaps, is it a bit of financing difficulties maybe or expensive financing? What's causing the holdups? I think this story differs from case to case. There is definitely a sense in the market that when it comes to quite a high value transaction, such as, I don't know, Grey & L&G, which has recently launched in the market as well, which has got a two billion equity ticket attached to it. I think with things like that, people don't really want to buy a smaller state, like a minority stake. They don't want to cede control over the assets, which dwindles the pool of bidders, really, if you're going into it from a solo basis. And, you know, people just say, well, it's obviously going to be the usual suspects that will win it. So, like, why would I bother if I was going in with a consortia? So that's one angle, I think. And I suppose just on the sell side, it could also be that people aren't fronting as much or putting as much store on the valuations that are being sought. Yeah, it struck me that one of the sources that you quoted in that piece, complaining that they haven't felt like the markets had a decent run since Ukraine, which clearly is positioning, you know, this outside of the current troubles, which for sure are not going to help anyone. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's kind of been one headache after another, really. And this is just the latest in a long line of hiccups. And I think it's not like a lot of those headaches have actually been cleared up. It's just that another headache has come and taken the headlines instead. So I think, you know, if we're looking at something like interest rates, those are still high. We've just stopped talking about high interest rates. But the problems of high interest rates and deal making still exist. Yeah. Well, and also, they arguably stand to get worse, right? Because I understand we're still, you know, we're like you said, we're not talking about it. And the volatility is grabbing other sorts of headlines. But I mean, not far in the background is the idea of higher inflation of a stop to this decrease in interest rates, maybe even a slight increase in some cases if needed. And that's just this really going to take headache into migraine territory, isn't it? Zach, so funnily enough, you wrote a piece which is coming at it from a different perspective. So Natalie's very much M&A, European focused. As we mentioned, the impact was there from Ukraine. And so far, the volatility isn't really doing much except adding to the headache. But you wrote something quite interesting, which is more from an LP point of view and really kind of saying that platform development, which has been all the rage in renewables in particular, and digital, is actually not exactly out of favor. But people really want certainty in those platform deals, and they're not prepared to value them highly if there isn't that. Is that a good description of what you ended up writing? Yeah, it's quite multifaceted. But I think we kind of got used to high platform development valuations peaking in the especially in the renewable sector in sort of 2021, 22, we saw quite wild EBITDA multiples. And there's been over the last few years, a degree of that coming down and just a bit more realism. But I think with all the headwinds that that sector is facing at the moment, it's come down quite significantly. Yeah, I created some data from CRCIB. Some people might remember as ConResNet Capital, the US renewables focused investment bank, they were saying that for development platforms with later stage pipelines, and a better track record, people are paying about 9x EBITDA, whereas for those with sort of late stage pipelines, people are paying about 5x or less EBITDA. And that's a big turnaround to what we've seen in the past. And in the renewable sector, that comes from both the threat of whatever may happen to the Inflation Reduction Act, which we continue to wait to see what happens, and also the impact of tariffs on development as well. Yeah, 5x is really low. And I think if you look at what happened with Macquarie, and the halting of the sale of Corio, which was their offshore wind platform, is quite interesting, because we wrote about that I think last October, precisely because that pipeline was so early stage, and we kind of said, let's see, this is really going to test the waters. And now what you're kind of coming out with is saying, well, you know, that the market really is speaking strongly here. And, you know, I think you're starting to see that. Did you have any other comments there, Zach? Did you hear any other stuff on that kind of early stage nexus that's worth mentioning? Well, so some other insights from CRCIB was also that a lot of equity investors have been adopting more of a preferred equity model for some investments, and sort of protecting some of that downside risk. And we heard about that, I think, at the back end of last year from Stone Peak, our New York forum. And, you know, you've just seen Brookfield earlier this year close a $1 billion fund that's kind of geared towards those kind of investments as well. And I think, you know, they put some money and egregious energy from that fund. So people are looking at how they can hedge their bets while still making plays in this environment. So, Zach, I'm going to stick with you for a while, because we're going from kind of European M&A to early stage development. You've just spent a couple of days at BNEF's big annual conference. It's obviously well known to a lot of our listeners and a big deal in the clean energy world. So very curious to see what you heard there, what caught your ear. Give us the highlights. What are people talking about in terms of deals in the clean energy sector in the U.S. in particular? Yeah, I mean, I would say attending the BNEF summit in New York, it's hardly like attending the Republican National Convention. So, you know, what I was surprised about was the amount of mentions on the agenda of LNG BNEF summit. I thought that was quite revealing in terms of where that sits in the spectrum these days. Is it renewable now? Sure. But the overarching theme was uncertainty. It's almost like the pausing of the tariffs actually lends to more uncertainty. You know, if the tariffs were introduced and they stuck, industry can find a way and some will be less fortunate. But then you have a reality that you're dealing with, kicking the can down the road for another three months kind of doesn't help anyone. But I think I wouldn't want to draw too many conclusions. I think from what the main conclusion was, was that a lot of people are taking a wait and see approach. No one's sort of drastically reallocating capital right now. They want to see how this all shakes up, but it's kind of seeing what actually happens versus what we're talking about right now. Yeah. Let me pick up on a few points there, actually. And I'm going to come to you, Natalie, because you wrote about LNG not that long ago. And it's quite interesting to see it, though not surprising, but interesting to see it pop up in what is essentially a clean energy conference. And you've been writing about it recently in a European context. What were the angles that you are picking up there and the sentiment towards LNG these days? Yeah, it's a really good question, because I think that it's one of those asset classes that people kind of would have shied away from and, you know, because it's it hasn't got the sort of like the fluffy credentials really of, you know, a renewable energy source or something that is directly linked to energy transition, but with a positive spin on it. I think the market sentiment around it has really shifted in the last few months and just what I'm hearing from people, but also having been tracking the national grid sale of its green LNG project, which is a big one in the UK, is quite interesting in that quite a lot of the selling points around it and what is being billed as the investability in the asset really is based around not just sustainability, but that is a strong angle in terms of LNG's part in the transition story as an essential piece of that narrative, essentially. But also it's to do with the energy security angle, which, as we all know, has really come to the fore. And I think it's definitely signs of a market that is less consumed with ostensibly investing in, you know, the politically correct assets, but more looking at the longer term investability of projects, actually, as, you know, not just a necessary evil, but actually an intrinsic part of the energy transition and security. Was there a bit of that at the conference, Zach? Was energy security coming to the fore around LNG? Yeah, I think you've got combinations of energy security and energy certainty, which kind of sound the same, but have some distinctions. And LNG benefits from exactly what it is and that you can take it to who needs it most. And it's not a fixed asset. So it kind of benefits from the tailwinds of energy security and people really just needing it now and then. One thing I wanted to ask you, Zach, were people commenting in relation to what the Trump administration did with Empire Wind in New York? Was there any chatter around that, the stop work order and obviously all the uncertainty that's creating around that asset class? Was it just more in general? What was the context? I actually think in comparison to last year's BNEF summit, there was remarkably little discussion on offshore wind altogether, which may say quite a bit about that part of the asset class in general. But there wasn't a great deal of talk on Empire Wind. But I think that's still just either at the back or front of everyone's minds. Now, the pausing of that project that was already under construction had already drawn $1.5 billion of project finance. I don't think people need to have a 45-minute panel discussion to know that your project is not necessarily safe, even if you think it is. Yeah, no, that's fair. Natalie, let me come back to you because I want us to try and give the listeners also a kind of broad overview of what sectors are kind of interesting from a deal flow perspective and maybe a little bit outside of the big data center, digital nexus and transition. But you'll tell me, but one of the things that I know you've been looking into is actually energy from waste. You expect some movement in that sector, don't you? Yeah, I think it's one of those ones really on energy from waste where there've been quite a lot of rumblings in the market for quite some time. People were discussing at our London conference, which was last autumn, actually, and without anyone really kind of knowing what any sort of pipeline might look like, really, it has been kind of on the wish list of people for being another bucket of investment opportunity really for some time. And I think just speaking with people this week, really, about what they're seeing, there is quite a lot of activity and some of it is a bit codependent, I think. So just anecdotally, I'm hearing that there's a big pipeline of energy from waste assets, which is coming to market, the first of which might not excite investors massively just because it's quite small ticket. You would definitely pop it in the mid-market bracket, sort of between 200 and 300 million. And it's EQT is selling its Earlsgate Energy Centre project, which is in Scotland, which has a CHP facility attached to it, essentially. But you may sort of say one swallow does not a summer make, but I'm hearing that actually that is going to pave the way for quite a few more opportunities in buyouts. So one of the owners with EQT is Brockwell Energy Limited, which is in turn owned by Pioneer Point Partners and Davison Kempner. And so they own 50% of each of Brockwell Energy and they own 50% of this project, which is coming to market. And so I think that once that disposal has gone through, then what I'm hearing is that that could lead to a potential disposal of Brockwell Energy as well. But also just on EQT's side, it looks as if they're looking to sell down quite a lot of the, if not all of the 2 billion portfolio, which the older listener among you may recall that when EQT bought the business, it was called Covanta and now it's called Encyclis. And then essentially the UK and Irish business of Covanta was spun out to become Encyclis, whereas it's quite confusing. Covanta's European business was rebranded as Encyclis, but Covanta still exists for the US business. And so within that portfolio, there's a wealth of opportunity for people because it's all very much the grey story, which investors are really looking at and they're really drawn to at the moment. And so while you may think it's a bit of a flimsy hook, one small energy from waste plant, actually there's quite a lot of room for growth and room to actually identify a proper pipeline over the coming months. I think one of my favourite themes on the deals front that I've seen sector-wise has been a little bit the transport resurgence. Again, Natalie, you've been looking into this. Hasn't been quite vanilla transport necessarily, though maybe there's a little bit of that also in the mix. But tell us, what have you been picking up on that front? Yeah, there's definitely a vein of kind of more traditional, kind of old school transport deals in the market, that's for sure. But also I think people are looking a bit outside the box really when it comes to what their definition of transport is. And there's quite a lot of what you might call transport adjacent activity going on in the market, which is actually, it's a bit more of an innovative way of having that transport link, it's definitely picked up in the last few months, but also going for more accessible assets, if you have those expertise. A couple of examples really have been some investments recently in the emergency aerial rescue space, which, you know, if you were a proper infrastructure purist, you might say that that wasn't quite... You might be saying rescue me. Yeah. Good one, Zak. And just by way of a recap, say Infra Capital and Vespa Infrastructure Partners acquired SAF Aero Group from Oaktree Capital and a BP of France. But I mean, you can tell by the sellers alone that the sellers aren't especially kind of in our space. And then I think just in the space of a couple of days, then Swiss Life Asset Managers acquired Allianz, which is a very similar type of aerial services provider. And I think what was interesting about that is, I mean, it's clearly transport, but it really does, it's a bit of an intermingling really, isn't it? In terms of there's a transport element, but it's also, you know, you could argue it's a social infrastructure crossover as well. And then something which isn't infrastructure at all, which is quite clearly rooted in private equity. And this sort of ties in with somebody I was speaking to earlier on in the week. He was saying that because the infrastructure projects that he's trying to track are not moving quickly enough, he's really dipping his toe into more private equity flavoured transactions. And there is that element here. But also it's just because with things like this, people can strike bilateral agreements without having to enter potentially lengthy, expensive auction places, which potentially could end in failure with loads of bigger players going for the same assets. There's a lot of bilateral activity at the moment just to try and avoid investors wasting their time with auctions that don't go anywhere. And so I think that all of those themes are really connected at the moment. Yeah. So a couple of notes then maybe for us to do a bit of a recap for listeners and to wind down the discussion we've just been having. I'm going to use Zach. Is it fair to say then with some of what we've been discussing regarding early stage development, less of an appetite because of all the headaches that are attached with developing projects these days? If you think to the last year, value-add strategies had been very much at the top of LP lists because of the macro environment. Do you think we are now going to see a little bit of a migration towards core, not only for this development aversion, so to speak, but also because tariffs probably will make inflation go up again? I don't think we can automatically make that conclusion. I think firstly, core still struggles from the headaches that we kind of mentioned at the beginning. Even if we're not talking about high interest rates every day, they are still quite high. So there has been admittedly quite a bit of success from core funds over say the last six months in terms of the return to good fundraising and deals closed. But I don't think we necessarily see a move from value-add to core because of what we see going on right now. I also think the way LPs are allocating, they're not weighing up a core fund against a value-add fund. They're investing as to what their requirements are returns wise. One quarter doesn't make a story, but KKR's results were out this morning and there hasn't been a substantial growth in the fundraising for their core fund over the last three months that would necessarily indicate a big shift. But I wouldn't draw too much from one fund and one quarter. Yeah, that's fair. We're still waiting and seeing. And I think the other thing, I'll ask you this now, Natalie, is it fair to say then that, and at least on the European side, we're seeing these sort of, you know, a little bit of a plodding pace to parts of the M&A market and processes, you know, dragging on and being costly on account of that. And so segments of the market, perhaps the mid market more, are, you know, getting a little bit creative and looking for where they can get bilateral deal flow, even if this isn't exactly, you know, infrastructure in a pure sense of the word. Is that a fair way to summarize what you've been seeing? Yeah, I think that really is a good summary of what people are saying really and what they're looking at. I think if people were waiting for kind of the perfect pipeline of infrastructure deals, kind of as the dictionary definition of infrastructure, you'd probably be waiting an awfully long time. And also, don't forget, we're fast approaching the summer months really, where if really if processes haven't launched kind of in the next couple of weeks, then you're looking at a post-summer launch, I think. So there is, there's definitely a hunger among market participants to build up some momentum. And if that means, you know, broadening your definition of what an infrastructure asset might be, for example, the TCR ground handling business, which is clearly transport adjacent, but you know, you might question whether it really fits the bill on that front. But I think there is a bit of a kind of without sounding dramatic, a bit of a do or die mentality now, because people just really have to get moving on things, you know, or risk potentially months of inactivity. And if that translates as going for slightly quirky assets, you might say, then I think people are much more willing to do that. I think that's a great note to end on. Zach, Natalie, thank you very much for your insights, and see you soon. Thanks for your day. Thanks for having me.

### AI, geopolitics and other takeaways from the Global Summit
**Publication Date:** 2025-04-10 06:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2594

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Walwisch, Editor-in-Chief of Infrastructure Investor, and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with America's Editor Zach Bentley to go over our main takeaways from the Infrastructure Investor Network's Global Summit recently held in Berlin. Zach and I talk about artificial intelligence, investors' craving for certainty in the midst of geopolitical upheaval, regulation, LP appetite for mid-market products, and much more. Hey, Zach. Good to see you. Hi, Bruno. So, a few weeks ago, we hosted the Infrastructure Investor Network's Global Summit in Berlin. It took place from the 17th of March to the 20th this year. This is our annual infrastructure jamboree, also happens to be the industry's biggest event, and I'm not just saying that because we host it. It's actually true. We had over 3,000 members attending this year, and that included 800-plus LPs, so, you know, a lot of networking, a lot of discussion in those four days, a lot of caffeine. Zach and I have been back. We were at the event. We've been back for a few weeks now, so we've decaffeinated a little bit compared to those four days, or at least I did. We've now had a chance to sleep as well. Some sleep is in the mix, that's right. And I think we're in a good position to do a bit of a debrief now. We're actually a little bit late here because there have been, I felt, countless takeaways posted on social media and across other channels, so I think the pressure is on us now to deliver a little bit, Zach. So, before we went, I wrote a letter sort of jokingly predicting that there were going to be two big talking points at the conference. One of them would be artificial intelligence. No big news here because we've been talking about it for ages now. And the other one would be that geopolitics would be up there for mindshare. So maybe let's start with AI. I feel the AI takeaway, if you want to call it, panned out. It was a huge discussion point at the conference, and actually, it became one just from the get-go. You did a keynote on the very first day with Bayo Ngolese, the legendary founder, chairman, CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, now a part of BlackRock. And then subsequently, there was an announcement also about what GIP's new $30 billion AI infrastructure fund, how it was going to look like. So maybe we can start there. You know, it's interesting because GIP, it's fair to say, was not in the lead in embracing digital infrastructure. They are now at the very kind of front of the pack on trying to come up with solutions to fund big hyperscale AI data centers. So maybe let's start there, Zak. What do you make of the announcement of the AI partnership, the latest developments? What do you think? Firstly, I think Bayo spoke on stage about trying to sort of revolutionize or change the way data centers are financed. And I think this fund that they're launching, what we know to be an open-end fund with an initial $30 billion target, it really is very much a big change in the way we've seen things done before, which is usually sort of closed-end funds buying large data center platforms. So in that sense, it's already quite different. And this is bringing the tech players into the financial game, which is also really interesting. So you have NVIDIA, you have Microsoft, you have XAI. And bringing all those players in as GPs, it really brings a total different paradigm to what we've seen before. I think there's quite a few interesting things to unpick there. One is the open-ended nature of the fund. I mean, open-ended infrastructure funds are still atypical. This is kind of a recognition that they want to hold on to those assets, I think, to a certain extent, or certainly they are not in a rush to sell them. And some of this, the industrial partnerships that you've highlighted here, on the one hand, it's GIP, right? This is what they do. And on the other hand, it's kind of interesting to see all of these names, including the likes of Microsoft, right? Going into something that's going to fund data centers for everyone, because this isn't just about funding Microsoft data centers, right? Yeah. And that's really interesting that if you have skin in this game, you need everyone who has skin to basically be doing well. Otherwise, this thematic that we're talking about doesn't reach the height that we all envisage it to become. And as you say, GIP were relatively late to the data center game, digital infrastructure game at large. But, you know, what they do bring is also a huge expertise in power as well, which we know to be the big bottleneck and which came up plenty of times during the global summit. I think you're right. I think power had been well established as the bottleneck when it comes to data center development in general, and in particular, AI data center development. And I think that panned out. Lots of interesting takeaways around power. I found Mark Gansey's comments, Mark Gansey, the CEO of Digital Bridge, you know, about his quest for sort of grid independence. Very interesting how they, you know, they have a couple of micro grids in Brazil and in the US. And you can see that they're really just trying not to get caught up in the grid bottleneck, isn't it? Yeah. And I think Mark Gansey spoke on the first panel of the global summit on the Tuesday. He spoke about the shortfall or the lack of correlation between the amount of data center capacity being built versus the amount of power capacity being built. And already at this, I guess, relatively early stage in this game, we're at this surplus. It seems like it's only going to grow. Yeah, I think so. So that's an interesting thing. I think the power bottleneck is kind of front and center. People are talking about it, etc. Mark also and some others spoke about another bottleneck, which I don't think is maybe quite front and center, but it's kind of up there, which is supply chain hang ups, which are now becoming more visible. And of course, now the situation geopolitically and in terms of trade has just changed dramatically. And so this might actually exacerbate. But my feeling was power is still the one bottleneck that's in everyone's minds. Supply chains, maybe not so much. Did you get a similar feeling from the conference? Yeah, but I don't think people weren't worrying about supply chains. I think that that is a front of mind concern for everyone building these things out. And I think Mark Hansie spoke about this as well on that panel. The question of can you deliver to the hyperscale of the data center that you promised? And actually, he was saying it's more than just buying some dirt in the ground and then turning up to Microsoft saying we have this. And he was saying the difficulties in building this out means that there's really only a few players you can really deliver at the highest level in this game. And actually, you're touching on something I want to jump into next, which is certainty, because I think that's another broad theme. But this notion that this is, especially at the large end of the scale, a game where only a few people will eventually be able to play, it is quite interesting. And especially at a time when you hear more and more talk, which I don't think this was maybe so front and center at the event, but certainly it's ongoing now, where there's talk that maybe there's overbuild of data centers. And of course, you have Alibaba Group's chairman, Joe Tsai, who famously said recently, we may be in the beginnings of a data center bubble relative to what AI applications actually exist. I don't feel that that came up a bit, but then it does tie into that point, doesn't it? Because if you can't navigate these adjustments and potential oversupply, then you're not going to be in a good place. I think there's a nuanced view of that in the sense that we may be building out a large amount of data centers. And the worry is that if the business case for AI doesn't quite exist as we believe it to be right now, then you have a large amount of oversupply. I think maybe the conversation about AI has maybe clouded our view, pun not intended, that actually the case for cloud computing is still huge. And we need the data center to build up for that, regardless of whether AI reaches its heights or not. Yeah, I think that is a fair point. And something we wrote about recently, actually, on Infrastructure Investor, that there's a clear need for data centers, even if the AI data center story doesn't quite pan out as some people expect. So let's go into certainty. I think we've discussed this between us. It felt like a bit of a broad, overarching theme across the four days, right? You mentioned Mark's comments, but there were others, right, who also brought this up. Yeah, this really felt coming out of four days that this was top of mind for everyone, which I guess is better to come out of an infrastructure investment conference talking about certainty than maybe in previous years coming out of an infrastructure investment conference talking about hydrogen. We have discussed extensively so far the AI debates, but obviously, there's so much uncertainty in the broader geopolitical world that certainty really was top of mind for everyone. And I think this was borne out in a number of panels. I think on the North American panel, Scott Jacobs of Generate Capital, he said that what he really looks for in investments is some TLC, which he described as transparent, long-term and certain policy, which I think kind of sums it up quite well. The uncertainty that is clouding everyone at the moment, I think everyone needs a bit of TLC. Yes. Even if it's kind of feeling like a wish list item, I mean, hopefully not, but it really is these days. Well, we speak the day after Liberation Day for our listeners. Yes, we should be pointing out we are, you know, in the aftermath of a barrage of tariffs. I also found interesting, I think, was it Jim Hughes' comments from ANCAP when he was talking about a potential IRA repeal and essentially kind of asking for the administration to either do it or don't do it. And again, pointing out that the uncertainty is a killer. So I found that very interesting also. And that captures a mood. Yeah, I found that a theme across a number of North American energy investors of if the administration is going to do something, can it please just let everyone know and do it and then we can all adapt. And I think this also came up on the panels. You know, unless you are investing in very sort of speculative projects, your renewable projects in the U.S. are probably quite economical regardless of IRA subsidies. So just the certainty of knowing what you're dealing with is actually on the wish list rather than subsidies itself. Yeah, absolutely. And I just want to do make a quick aside because I think we should segue into regulation now that we're talking about policy, because I think that was a theme at the conference. But I want to just do a quick aside because you made a little bit of a joke about hydrogen. And I thought one of the most interesting takeaways I heard was from the keynote session with Francesco Starace, who's a partner at EQT and he's obviously the former CEO of Italian utility Enel. And he was quite, I don't know if you recall this, but it was quite interesting because towards the end of his talk, he sort of acknowledged there was a moment of extreme hype around hydrogen. Now it's kind of back to planet Earth, more or less, he felt. And then he openly questioned, will hydrogen make it? And he kind of said, we really need to watch out for it over the next three to five years, because if it doesn't, then we have to look elsewhere. It's not the end of the world. And it was quite, quite a change again in mood, wasn't it? Towards hydrogen, especially coming from a European, because it's a big thing in Europe, right? Yeah. And Francesco speaks from an absolute wealth of experience. And he did point to the old days of solar thermal, which if people don't remember what those kind of long reflection, weird looking solar plants, which especially got damaged in the whole Spanish retroactive cuts. He was saying that billions was poured into that industry. And eventually the realization came that these don't work in the way that the industry will quite like it to. And the industry learned to move on and stick to solar PV. And I think that's the point he was making about hydrogen is, let's have a look at this. Let's see what we can do over the next three to five years. If by then it's not working, we need to know to walk away. Yeah. And I think there's an obvious warning contained in that for the hydrogen bulls in the industry. I think regulation is something we have to touch on. I think this wouldn't have been a global summit if there hadn't been some kind of talk on regulation. So this in a way was to be expected. But when I was doing my onstage keynote interview with Lee Harrison, and he's Macquarie Asset Management's Head of Real Assets, I think it struck me and I know it struck some of us how committed he was to the UK water sector. He I think viewed the regulatory prospects slightly better in a way, but he just viewed the need for investment as something that was there and people were coming around to it. And he seemed very committed to it, even though there are obvious challenges to this sector. And then as we speak, KKR is actually preferred bidder to take over Thameswater and do a bit of an equity rescue. So I want to pick your brain there, Zach, how did you feel about this particular comments on UK water regulation? Well, I think the most pointed thing about Lee's comments, I think I counted three, maybe four times he said to you that he believes in the medium and long term future of UK regulated assets, which is a striking omission of the words short term. And I think if you say it three or four times on stage, that becomes deliberate. And it's largely reflective of the mood. And we heard it from other investors in the room over the few days, Alina Osorio from FIERA, also an investor in Thameswater, that this strive to have lower bills and improved outcomes hasn't worked and the regulator needs to find a different way. No, I'm not sure that's coming in the next five years, given the regime that's been published. But it was striking how Lee was optimistic, but not right now. Yeah, I think that's a really good point also, because and this is a question I raised on stage with Lee. And it's also a question that I will be curious to see which vehicle KKR ends up putting Thameswater in. Certainly on the Macquarie side, Southern Water, which is the investment that brought them back to the UK water sector, that is in their super core fund. I mean, they originally invested 1.1 billion in Southern Water, Sterling, followed by 550 million top up in 2023. They're currently spearheading a 900 million equity raise. So you know, a lot of work, what some people might even call a turnaround job is, you know, being put into Southern. Certainly what KKR is going to do with Thameswater, I think is going to be a turnaround job. So it's interesting. I mean, Lee had a good response in terms of saying, well, these aren't buy it and forget it assets, you have to roll up your sleeves. But from a risk return perspective, I find it fascinating the amount of work that is going into these regulated assets now, versus the vehicles they are often housed in and the idea around them of what they should be delivering from a risk return perspective. Yeah, well, I think Lee joked to you that it's too late now to change course on the fact that Southern Water is in a super core vehicle. But I guess it turns the clock back a little bit because these assets weren't considered super core as such when people were first investing in them. We've pointed out in the past the returns that Macquarie have made on their initial investment in Thameswater, and those aren't super core returns, that that was a reasonable rate of return for what an infrastructure investor could expect at that point. So maybe we're just winding the clock back a little bit going to what it used to be. And maybe that's not the worst thing. And this also brings to mind the very interesting comment from Louis Roche-Bourgard, who's co-head of equity for French manager in Frannaty, but obviously he was at Vinci for quite a long time. And he made it quite clear that he felt regulation had been highly supportive in the recent past. And we needed to think that states and governments are constrained in different ways nowadays, and that regulation is bound to become less supportive. And if you're kind of not on top of it, you end up exposed to huge risks. And I think that was a very good summary, right, of what the landscape looks like. Yeah. And I think it was also someone from Swiss Life summed it up very well, saying that... Oh, yes. Gabriele. Yes. Yes. Sorry. That regulation is a double-edged sword. And maybe we haven't quite figured that out before when investing in regulated assets until now. Absolutely. What else caught your ear at the conference? Just to add on the regulation front, it was day four in the afternoon. So maybe people who actually missed it, but it was Mark McAllister, who's chair of Ofgem, the UK energy regulator, who made a pointed reference when he was on stage, essentially saying that we're not off what we haven't made the same strides for lower returns and lower bills in the same way that they have, and was actually really talking a lot about innovation, which maybe you don't expect from a regulator, or we've come not to expect, but it was really interesting. He was talking about the innovations being made in pumped hydro storage. And actually, maybe, obviously, this is geographic specific, but maybe this would come to do a better job than battery storage would do in the coming years. That's very good point. Yeah. What else, Zach? What else was interesting from your point of view? This wasn't necessarily something that was coming up on stage a lot, but it was coming up a lot in my sideline conversations with a number of LPs. It seems that the desire for mid-market products from LPs was stronger than ever. And this is anecdotal, but it did seem so many LPs I was speaking to stated their desire for more mid-market products, and whether that's LPs who are already invested with large cap funds and want to diversify their portfolio, or whether that's more immature LPs trying to find their way into the market and thinking mid-market is a good first way to go. It was interesting just how much this was coming up. Good point. I think one thing that I also noticed, and I don't know how much of a difference this is really going to make, but it seemed to me that maybe this year there was a little bit more willingness to really talk about risk, and I mean risks in so-called emerging markets or growth markets versus OECD markets. There was a bit more of a willingness to kind of point to the asset level. I think this was kind of evident on the first day when we had our emerging markets forum. Somehow it felt a little bit different to me that maybe people had more of a point, given all that's going on on OECD nowadays in risk, that you really have to pay attention to the assets and the risks that come with them and not get sort of hung up on labels or take some kind of false comfort. But then again, it does feel we've discussed all of this before, so I'm not sure it's going to move the needle and people are going to all of a sudden start pouring money into these markets. But that's how it felt to me. I wonder how that came across to you. Yeah, it's hard not to feel that some of this sentiment is just an immediate reaction to certain geopolitical events going on. And you might want to remember that presidents have four-year terms. So sort of shifting your entire perception of risk depending on something going on right now isn't necessarily the best thing. But I would refer listeners to Infrastructure Investor's April cover story for a more in-depth look at what risk looks like in 2025. Absolutely. And I think from my end, there's one sort of last takeaway I picked up also. I know that one of our friends at the event also picked it up on his takeaway. I'm actually talking about Aaron Vale, who most recently led the infrastructure client solutions team for CBRE Investment Management. He's now independent. He did what I thought was a great takeaway from the event. And in it, he highlighted, you know, the Maple Lake model of the big Canadian pension funds going direct being sort of a crossroads. That's, by the way, something we spoke about, direct investment, and wrote about in our February cover story, not just in relation to Canada, but just in general. But I did pick it up on the sideline of the event, on the sideline conversations. People questioning whether these portfolios were really going to do well or if they were going to have issues. And Aaron picked up on that. I don't know if you picked up on that. I'm just, yeah, I thought that was interesting that that's coming up more in conversation. Yeah. And I think it was on the final day that it was actually OTPP said, at least on the private equity side, they would be looking at making less direct investments and more fund or partnership level investments. And you referred to our February cover story, I think this came up a bit where people were talking more, but just asking the question whether we should be seeing more of this kind of strategy from direct investors. Yeah. And I think any last takeaways we could really, I think, do a three hour podcast on this. We're not going to. But what would you end on? Any last thoughts? Well, I think a three hour podcast on this would actually be considered day five of the Global Summit. That's true. So I'm not going to subject listeners to that. I would just leave listeners with the idea of let's not be hasty. I think I would echo what Bill Green of Climate Adaptive Infrastructure said on one of the panels of put your phones down and listen to what's actually going on around you and ignore the noise. And actually, what's going on around you does sometimes look different to what you're seeing on your phone. And not to, you know, over egg on an asset class cliche, but this is a long term asset class and it can be easy to get caught up in the moment. But we are really talking about long term investments, long term trends and riding them. And so it's in the midst of the chaos and the noise. It's sometimes, you know, you kind of lose sight of that. Right. So I think that's a good note to end on. We have a new venue for next year. We are actually going to move the conference from the Berlin Hilton, where we've done it for many, many years now, into a venue called the Station, which is kind of a very infrastructure sounding name. So watch out for that. You will be able to get more information in the coming months. Zach, thank you very much for your insights. And I will speak to you soon. Thank you. See you. That, again, was America's editor, Zach Bentley. Infrastructure Investor Network members already feeling the need to connect further should keep our upcoming investor forum in mind taking place in London on the 9th and 10th of September. It'll gather 300 plus industry leaders, including over 150 LPs. We've included a link with more information alongside this podcast.

### Infrastructure’s digital age
**Publication Date:** 2025-04-08 07:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2595

**Full Transcript:**
Digital infrastructure has emerged as one of the most exciting sectors in the asset class, and over the past few years, particularly since the advent of the COVID pandemic, digital infrastructure's growth has accelerated rapidly. Artificial intelligence is playing a key part in this, necessitating the construction of more and more data centers. But digital infrastructure is bigger than that, and fiber and towers are both significant pieces of the puzzle. In this special episode, sponsored by Palastar Capital and Edmund Rothschild, we will discuss the outlooks for each of these sub-sectors. We're joined by Josh Obler, an investment partner at Palastar, which is an investor laser-focused on the digital infrastructure space, and by Jean-Francis Duch, Global Head of Infrastructure and Structured Finance at EDR, which also runs an infrastructure debt franchise called Bridge. We will explore how AI is transforming the data center landscape, where to find the best opportunities in fiber, and why towers continue to make such a good investment. I'm James Lineker with PEI Group, and this is the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. It would not be possible to discuss digital infrastructure at the moment without touching on data centers. I put it to Duch and Obler that data centers are the hottest investment in infrastructure right now, and they agree. Here's Josh Obler from Palastar. I think that's true, and I think it's not just maybe infrastructure. I think it's probably all of Wall Street mobilizing for the big hyperscaler players, kind of $200 billion a year capex as an astronomical number that they're putting to work in the space. I think we're all building behind that power infrastructure, actual data center, accumulating the land to support all of that. You've got a very, very tight current market, and I think that you've got a very, very long-term investable trend inside of the data center space. I think that everyone involved in the sector is now highly focused on how do you do this and how do you do it appropriately. With tight supply chains throughout the market, equipment lead times lengthening, complexities in sourcing power, and a tight labor supply, there are challenges to overcome. There are also questions to be answered. How do you make sure that you're not getting maybe taken out with the tide of huge investable quantums of dollars and making sure that you're investing behind long-term stable projects, things that we can truly call infrastructure? There's a lot to figure out today in this space. It's really interesting. We brought on a new partner of ours, a gentleman, Gonzalo Bernardo, who'd ran the data center business at Omer's, but prior to that, he was an energy and infrastructure banker at Morgan Stanley. So you can start to see how a number of skill sets are getting crossed here. Jean-Francis from EDR also sees the data center boom as a long-term opportunity, requiring a diverse skill set to fully understand. The temptation may be to chase every data center deal in sight, but it's important to be more disciplined than that. So how do you do that intelligently? Well, hey, you hire the right people. And similar to what just said, I ask when we set up the bridge platform, an ex-colleague of mine in banking who is a veteran of digital infrastructure project financing to join and tell me if there was a case for data centers, because as always, the question of the definition of infrastructure and is it real estate? Is it infrastructure? And that was the first point to hire talent. Second was to structure it in a way where you could argue that you're meeting from the debt standpoint, the features that investors expect from an infrastructure play. It took us four years to make a first investment in data center. And that was, I won't name the off-taker, but A-rated, mega large company, corporate. We were in Chippewa, so good location. And it was like a 20-year contract. So it was almost creating a corporate-public-private partnership to a certain degree. And we got our risk comfortable with that. But as you know, we invested more and more. We could take a bit more risk, have more diversification in the subscriber revenue base. And that's how we started to really invest maybe more and across perhaps the whole range of opportunities that data center offer. But for us, and perhaps if we focus on Europe, we need also to demonstrate a few things. European investors, asset managers, as a consequence, are very focused on ESG. So of course, we're going to try to make sure it's a good location. We're going to see if we are powered by renewable energy. That's a nice way to invest in the space. Obler is looking for investments to tick many of those same boxes. If you step back and we look at, I would say, the entire breadth of the sectors in digital infrastructure. So whether it's micro-wireless, fiber data centers, we think that there's probably a huge range of risk that you can take on as a digital infrastructure investor. And we think that you can invest in this space ranging from really core, super core assets, really long duration, really kind of stable assets. And then you can move toward almost private equity type risks. And maybe on kind of the far end of the axis, you can almost invest in basically growth equity in and around some of these types of subsectors. And I think that if you look at the opportunities in the data center space, then the question is, how do you make it kind of the most infrastructure like? And we've got two modules that we think that we can turn, if you want to call them boxes. The one is business model, right? So how much risk am I taking on development? How much risk am I taking on my future need to land new customers? Am I investing in an asset that's already cash flowing, already something that is in the ground? So one, what is the business plan and what is the operational risk that we are looking to support? And then two, how do we modulate that with capital structure? Broadly speaking, I think that we've got long-term sustainable trends behind the digital infrastructure space. This is a multi-trillion dollar global investable theme for the next decade plus, right? I think that we are all using huge sums of data. I think that there's new use cases coming out, what would you say, kind of on a daily basis, right? That people are doing more with their devices. AI has obviously been a huge boon, driving mobility, driving use cases like this. So I think that the asset-based infrastructure required necessary and hugely long-term, but you always kind of need to keep an eye on it. And I think if you can focus on true fundamentals and cashflow, but the market loses sight of these things all the time, right? Valuations have a way of running ahead of themselves. People can invest way out kind of forward on the curve. So you're always watching and I think trying to be mindful of all these types of developments. AI has been a boon, as Obler says, and the world we live in today is markedly different, even from the world of five years ago, and is expected to change drastically in the next five years too. But are we all getting ahead of ourselves when we talk about AI? While it is fueling growth in digital infrastructure, are we in danger of overestimating its potential? Duchesne thinks AI is fundamental to our future. I think we're broadening to the digital infraplay. And actually you could argue that AI goes even beyond, because I'm a big fan of the intermodality, interconnectivity of infrastructure. And I always say, if you think of smart cities and whether you're managing what I call the iCloud of heavy charging, you're trying to optimize the consumptions up to the meters or smart meters that are being used, how you try to create energy efficiencies in the social space. I think all that points at a need for data and yes, AI is there. I even realized that some peers use AI to write credit memos. So it's everywhere, it's happening. It hurts a bit my old school values and thinking our business is about people, but actually you could argue it's complimentary. But now that I've said that, yeah, I think AI is there. The need for data is definitely there. And that's what makes the digital infraspace fascinating because it's back to Europe, fiber optic, data center, towers, and all you can do. All that offers a lot of opportunities, be diversification. And you can see that from countries to countries, they have different ways, different technologies. They try to push forward. And it's our job as asset managers to understand technologies. And interestingly, it's funny because Josh mentioned internet and I think we're old enough to have been in this business in the late nineties, early 2000. And it went from fantastic to overvalued to really wrong. But if you look at the digital play now within the whole infrastructure universe, in many ways, I think that the debt structures are much, before it was always a quasi LBO, leveraged finance. It's a bit more project finance type. And I don't think the valuation of the underlying business are crazy. Whereas there are other sectors, and I'm not going to kill the other sectors we invested, but we are obviously more cautious. And I will always say that the digital infra, as much as there is the AI challenge, but in terms of its positioning, it's probably quite sound. And in many ways, the underpinning infrastructure are quite switching to traditional infra. And I love digital. I think it's fascinating, but I think it's also a safe place. Data centres may be a safe place for investors, and there's certainly no shortage of excitement about that part of the market. But how about fibre? That's a sector which has faced its fair share of headwinds, but Palastar and EDR are both active in it. In fact, I put it to Dush that some 60% of EDR's digital infrastructure portfolio appears to be in fibre. He says that sounds about right. It's interesting. We had an investment committee where we discussed whether we had too many investments in fibre optic. And our position as investment managers is no. And if you look at our overall platform, probably 25% is digital, quite important from where we started. And fibre optic is probably 15%. So you could argue that almost from a mathematical standpoint, we're in that 60% zone, probably also because of the scale of some investments. So yes, it is that. And we've been an early mover, but it's true as well that we're trying to keep it within the assets we want to invest in. A lot has been done already in terms of deployment of fibre, but there's still a lot of opportunities. And I think the key word is how selective you can be. Being selective. This is a theme that also came up when we discussed data centres. So how important is it to be selective when looking at fibre? It is crucial for us. And like I said, each year we have up to 15 opportunities for fibre optic. And we go through quite a comprehensive grid of criteria to see what could make sense for our portfolio. If we tick the boxes, which we think are right. And by the way, right doesn't mean we're risk averse. Is it a new country? Is it diversification? Or is it complimentary for what we've done? Is there competition from, I don't know, other technologies, satellite? And so we go through and we select the five, six investments we're going to focus on for fibre optic. Okay. So where are those opportunities? I think there's a need that more countries, again, in Europe, we invested initially a lot in France, not that long actually, because we're not totally satisfied with that quasi PPP scheme. We thought it was good, but not the traditional PPP, but we invested. We invested in Germany. We invested in other countries, but Scandinavia has a few good opportunities now as well. Look across Europe, still a lot of opportunities in core Europe or other countries. But, and I mentioned it, we are beginning to look at investment opportunities in the US. There's a lot going on in the US. And I think Josh is probably the best suited because debt, as ambitious as we are, comes after the equity holders or whatever have made investments. And you're in New York, so you may observe quite some activity there. We see a lot of activity, obviously in the US market. We see it internationally as well. Europe, the UK, a lot of investable opportunities in the fibre sector. In the market here in the US, there's a ton of investment going on, and there's a lot of opportunity to build both connecting people's homes with fibre, fibrising the US market. Traditionally, the US market was connected all with copper lines, coaxial fibre. We had a big build out decades ago of fibre in the US, which didn't necessarily happen in other countries around the world. And cable played a pretty good role in getting the US connected to the internet and supplying broadband to huge chunks of the country. But I think as time moves on and people have big demand for symmetrical speeds, big capacity up and down, fibre is one of the few solutions that can really provide that in a big way. And so I think you're going to see much, much higher penetration of fibre across the US market. And that's providing both the people's homes, which we see a lot of opportunity to support those build plans, as well as enterprise fibre, as well as more long haul type fibre, connecting data centres and things like that. Fibre businesses, if you ask us, probably are a little bit more competitive than some of the other project financing type opportunities you might see around digital infrastructure compared to, let's say, certain types of data centres or compared to macro wireless towers. So when we look at fibre businesses, I think, you know, we're very cognizant of, are they free cash depositive? Or are they in their development cycle? How much money needs to be invested for them to get to their home's past or to support the amount of penetration that they need to get to a steady state place in their business? What are their churn rates? Obla suggests the key to success in the fibre business is structuring. At the heart of this is how capital can be used best to invest in and develop broadband businesses. I refer to structure in two ways. The one is we've got, you call them dark fibre or wholesale partnerships with private network operators that can be, you know, basically an offtake. So we become more of a physical asset network provider and someone else will then manage the customer relationship. And that's a pretty good slicing of the risk. And I think that we, you know, like to own physical network asset, high margin business, and then someone else can be in more of the customer facing role. So that's one example. And then the second is using capital structure. So, you know, trying to maybe get a little bit more senior and using preferred instruments or sort of debt like instruments where we can use capital to maybe catalyze completion of some of the fibre network build outs that are going on. So then how can capital play an important role either to drive consolidation, rationalization, and basically get the network to where it needs to be kind of completed and finished. So there's just a ton of opportunity, a big need for capital. So we have heard that there is plenty of opportunity in data centres and in fibre, but how about in that third key pillar of digital infrastructure? Towers. In some ways, towers feel like a very traditional sector of the asset class, but that's certainly not a criticism. There's that almost feeling that it might be old school at the same time. It's probably also what investors would see as a tangible infrastructure, obviously. And we've all known that from the moment, you know, mobile operators, MVNOs, you needed these towers. Yeah, we feel it's a sector where we can, you know, have either, you know, opportunities in the senior investment grade space. And I would say for us, it's a question of finding the right balance between a certain risk profile and how it's priced, because it can be priced aggressively in many ways, which is good for the equity holder. For us, it's a question. There's a lot of whole core situations. But what's interesting also linked to towers is made us think of other sectors like what we call, you know, land infrastructure aggregators, you know, where, you know, you would find land where, you know, you can grant a right or the ownership of the land so that people can manage, for example, towers. Macro wireless is an interesting angle to this. Palastar has been active in metro markets for over a decade. It can be tricky for wireless carriers to provide coverage in urban areas where densely packed buildings pose a clear challenge. So rooftop locations have some clear benefits, as well as some that may be less obvious. We started investing in, you know, rooftop assets, as well as the ground lease underneath the cell phone tower. So pretty niche portions of the wireless infrastructure space, but highly defensive, very, very high margin, triple net businesses that we would basically run at 95% free cash flow margin on long-term offtakes with mission critical assets, investment grade, kind of, you know, triple B plus, A rated type counterparties. And the amazing thing about these assets is that they also grow, right? So in the US market, you've got a lot of growth from co-location, which means, you know, if you've got an existing lease with Verizon or AT&T, that your second customer will come on and co-locate in that same location. You can amend the lease. There's contracted escalators that are part of the economics there. So I agree with you, you know, it kind of feels like old school infrastructure, you know, very, very long-term assets in place for a very long period of time. We see, you know, little to no churn on those assets. So, you know, highly, highly valuable. With data centers, demand grew rapidly with COVID and growth is accelerating again as AI comes online. So could a technological shift from 5G to 6G have a similar effect for towers? Well, maybe not. And Dusch suggests we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. There could, however, be a boost from AI in this space. It's always exciting, but, you know, the thing is, my take is, have we invested in 5G? No, I think the mobile operators have sufficient cashflow to self-finance it or through corporate debt. So the days where we were fighting, you know, to win the right to be an underwriter of, you know, UMTS are probably behind also, perhaps because the licenses, you know, prices have gone down as well. So I would say 5G, 6G, we monitor it for us. The key thing is, and it's almost back to towers, is how you can deploy it in some areas efficiently, you know, because we always talk of competition, fiber optics, satellite, and I would love to finance a satellite deal because I've been trying for the last 25 years. So at some stage that will come, but, you know, what is interesting with all these technologies is how it points at the needs and perhaps to use the various technologies available in the digital space to create, you know, the kind of almost full coverage we're trying to achieve. And that for me is a challenge, which we've already seen with 5G to a certain degree. I think AI is going to create more demand for physical assets across all three subsectors. This is one giant connected value chain ecosystem, right? Having data centers connected by a robust fiber, robust fiber connecting people's homes, connecting people's businesses and connecting cell phone towers. And then mobility obviously pays a key part in data consumption. Just, you know, how do we use our phones? How do we manage our lives? I would say that, you know, it's probably 30, 40 years, right, of mobile playing an increasingly large role in our lives. So it would be hard to see us not seeing a lot of mobile participation from all of the investment going to AI, whether that is using your device to review Instagram, Facebook, and seeing, you know, new content generated for advertising or who is receiving which ad, whether it's interacting with chat GPT to ask for something, advice on the move, on the go, or inside of your home, you're always kind of interacting through your personal device, you know, whether that's, you know, more robust physical infrastructure for connected devices, cars, you know, so forth, industrial applications, all of that is going to create more demand and more need for mobile infrastructure, right, and for towers. Clearly, there are exciting developments on the horizon and digital infrastructure is riding the wave of technological advancement. Predicting what will come next is never easy, but it is also quite fun. So that's exactly what I asked both of our guests to do. Here's what they had to say. When we launched Bridge 10 years ago, it was, yeah, fiber optic is emerging. Is there really a case in Europe to project finance 5G? Maybe not. Satellite, we discussed it. Towers, yes, believed in it. Data center, we had to make a case. Now, I wonder if there's a technological shift, per se, a new technology that might arise, or if it is all about, for example, being able to provide that huge capacity that we need. And if you ask me about even energy, you know, five years ago, I would have said, you remember, was like, ah, Gen 2, energy transition in the field of energy, green mobility, for energy, battery storage, cogeneration, maybe hydrogen. Me, I don't see a new technology emerging because even 4G, since 4G, I think 5G, 6G is an evolution. And I think it's more about finding that extra capacity. When we look at data centers, are there still good sites where to develop these data centers? So that's what I would say, you know, maybe, you know, we improve the efficiency of the infrastructure, we find space to do a bit more. And I think, and maybe I'm wrong, but I was listening to you, Josh. And I think it's more about how you connect the different technologies and use them in the most efficient way to provide, you know, the ultimately the data and satisfy the demand, also linked to AI. Obeler agrees that technology is key in a space such as digital infrastructure, where advancements are made so regularly. A lot of this advancement is incremental. AI could be more of a step change. I think that looking forward a couple of years, if you said in the tower industry, I think we will see kind of in the US market, let's say, modest incremental growth in tower count. And then you're going to see as we approach the end of the decade, you know, further accelerating of CapEx investment from the wireless carriers, as they prepare for, you know, 6G, as they continue to densify their networks for 5G. I think if you look in the fiber space, US market's going to keep pushing to approach, I don't know, it's going to be a hundred percent penetration, but, you know, getting fiber past as many US homes as possible. I think that there's a good long-term investable theme behind that, you know, kind of beyond the next two, three years. And then I think, you know, data centers, data centers, we're going to be talking about AI for a long time. I think that there's, you know, tremendous movement inside of the US tech companies to keep investing in data centers. I think that Wall Street views it as a growth area. I think that there's honestly national security implications around data centers and, you know, kind of global questions of who's driving the next kind of generation of compute and technology. I think one of the more interesting questions that we're all going to see over the next couple of years is where are we going to find enough power generation to support all of the new data center cases? And is it going to come from cleaner source? Is it going to buy us toward nuclear? Nuclear has very long kind of lead times behind it. Is it ever going to able to be, you know, kind of, you know, wind or solar powered? Perhaps not. Totally agree with you. That's the question, Mark. And it's interesting because you nailed it in terms, again, of the interconnectivity to a certain degree and term modality of infrastructure. And it always comes back to the question of are we going to manage enough power generation? And it's interesting because for us as an asset manager so far, we have had an exclusion for nuclear power investor in Europe. But we've seen, for example, some countries, France, and it's not because I'm French, we're London based. But France has been, you know, an early mover in the nuclear space. And they even, you know, consider that it was part of the taxonomy in definition in France, but taxonomy has different interpretations across Europe. But you can see other countries are starting to think about it, especially if you look at Japan being able to produce nuclear energy, perhaps without all the theme of uranium waste, etc, the fission of particles. So it's interesting because you're right, the questions around many topics linked to data of cleaner, greener infrastructure is about the energy production. That energy question is a big one. Data centres are expected to account for a significant slice of power generation in the near future. They already account for around 2% of US power generation and could hit 10%, albeit varying quite a lot by market. That variability is true in Europe too. In Ireland, for example, data centres have already been using more than 20% of the country's metered electricity. But the energy conversation could be a whole separate podcast. And unfortunately, that's all the time we have for now.

### The three pillars of a ‘classic Blackstone infra deal’
**Publication Date:** 2025-03-20 08:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2596

**Full Transcript:**
What makes a classic Blackstone infrastructure deal? That would always be an interesting question in its own right, but it gains added prominence when you consider that infrastructure was actually Blackstone's best-performing asset class of 2024, generating a 21% gross return, according to the firm's Q4 results. As it turns out, there are three pillars to a Blackstone deal, as Global Head of Infrastructure Sean Klimczak reveals in the latest episode of the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. That forms a big part of our discussion, which also explores the advantages of building a portfolio within an open-ended framework, the enduring appeal of the transportation sector, and, of course, Blackstone's blockbuster acquisition of Pan-Asian data center business Airtrunk. I'm Bruno Alves, Editor-in-Chief of Infrastructure Investor, and this is the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. Hi, Sean. Good to see you. Welcome to the podcast. Hey, Bruno. Great to be with you. Many thanks for the time here today. So Sean, just before Christmas, we actually had Verena Lim of Macquarie here on the podcast. And obviously, you know, Verena was on the sell side of Airtrunk, the Pan-Asia data center business that Blackstone-led consortium acquired. And I want to ask you the same question that I asked Verena when she was on the acquisition side. And the question I asked her was, how much of the acquisition price that you paid for Airtrunk is for what is there in terms of contracted capacity, operational assets, etc., versus what's in the pipeline and yet to come? I would say as it relates to Airtrunk, we were really excited about backing an industry leader, the largest data center developer in Asia, backing a founder, a visionary, Robin Kahuta, and investing behind a business where Blackstone had real scale. So when you think about that opportunity there, it was underpinned by in excess of 800 megawatts of existing capacity that was fully contracted. And so the lion's share of the value of Airtrunk was buying the existing in-place cash flows. There's of course a moderate piece of that business in that purchase price that is ascribed to future development. But I would just say, as we think about the future development opportunity there, we thought we would amortize that premium just over the first handful of years. So it's an investment that we're incredibly excited about. And as I just look at Asia more broadly, I would say it's arguably the most exciting market for data centers on a go-forward basis. Let's use a market like India, where there are fewer data centers in India with its 1.5 billion people than we have in, say, Chicago here in the US, which is the number five data center market in North America. So I would just say, we don't think that will be the case five years from now. And we're incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead. When you went into it, one thing that I thought caught my eye, and I think also caught the eye of quite a few other people, is you drew together four different Blackstone strategies. So real estate infrastructure, tactical ops, and private equity into your AirTron bid alongside your bidding partner. And I think that the competitive advantage of doing that is kind of fairly obvious, given the scale of this. But I just want to play devil's advocate for a second and also ask you, is there a risk of sending a message here that you're kind of blurring different risk-return profiles to get into these data center assets, or do you fear it creates the impression that you're sort of giving the message that they fit all kinds of risk-return strategies? What is the thinking there? Yeah. Well, listen, I think we look at an opportunity like AirTron, and we think it presented an opportunity for us to leverage the best of Blackstone, to leverage our scale, to leverage our global reach, and to leverage the insights across different groups. So I look at, for instance, the ability to leverage our leading real estate teams' views on the real estate aspects of the transaction and to leverage our infrastructure views on, for instance, matters like power access. I think it represents an opportunity for us to put the best of Blackstone together. As it relates to the opportunity, I would just say what we're looking at doing here is building long-term contracted data centers where you've got certainty of cash flow, but where we think the underlying returns are actually quite high, I should say. And so as I look at it, I don't view it as a blurring of returns. I think the opportunity in data centers is attractive enough to bring in other groups of the firm. And as you said, one of the competitive advantages is we could be one partner in one check here, but where we didn't actually have to go out on the risk spectrum, for instance, for our infrastructure business, we're going out and signing 15-plus-year contracts with the most credit-worthy counterparties in the world. And you've been, I think it's fair to say, very bullish on the generational opportunity to invest at the intersection of data centers and power. You wrote a piece not that long ago exactly on that, and there's no doubt that the CAPEX needs are huge in this sector. And I think you've alluded to what I'm already about to ask you next, but I really wanted to get your take about how much of the opportunity do you think ticks the boxes of traditional infrastructure investments? You know, when it comes to good contracts, barriers to entry, long-term duration, etc. Because sometimes there's a bit of this feeling that you just cannot lose money in this sector nowadays because of the size of the opportunity. Yeah, listen, the industry is not one without risk, and it's not one that will be straight up and to the right. What I would just say is, is we look at this underlying asset class, and we think it's quite attractive and checks all of the boxes for infrastructure. So when you think about it in terms of what are we ultimately building, we're building the equivalent of a warehouse with access to significant power and air conditioning, and we're contracting that out for 15 to 20 years. So if you're building data centers with lump sum turnkey construction contracts, and you have your financing in place and your long-term contract with the offtaker, one of the most credit worthy counterparties in the world, you know, that feels to us to be a core plus investment during the construction phase, and then that very quickly flips to a core or super core 15 to 20 year investment after construction. And so I look at it and, you know, believe it checks all of the boxes for infrastructure. I think the big question you have to think about is, is just the acquisition premium. And if I think about, for instance, our investment in QTS, where at this point, every incremental investment is being done at book value and where we're not, because of our long-term hold perspective, we're not going out and paying an acquisition premium for a platform each time we do a new data center. I continue to be incredibly excited about the opportunity there. And I think you've just hit on a really important point because everybody is really piling into the sector these days and generalists and specialists, et cetera, and that puts pressure on valuations. So you're alluding to platform investment as a way of not getting stuck in this kind of higher valuation territory. What else do you try and do to make sure you're acquiring a reasonable value? Yeah. So listen, I think from this point forward, because we've got our primary platforms in the form of QTS, QTS Europe, and Airtrunk, I think really what we're focused on right now is trying to think about where will future developments be and ensuring that we have powered land available for our hyperscale partners when they need it, ensuring that you've got the supply chain lined up. You've got the right partnerships with utilities and really trying to escape to where the puck is going rather than where it is. And just to touch on the power question for a second, it's obviously what everybody talks about these days. You're doing this at scale. It feels as much of a problem as an opportunity if you want to put it that way, but I really want to hear from somebody who, like you guys, that are doing it. How are you viewing the power question and appreciate it's different in different markets? Yeah. Well, listen, I think we benefit at Blackstone from having the ability to pair our real estate knowledge with our infrastructure knowledge and that deep understanding of the power markets and having spent now more than 25 years around those markets. I think it allows us to better understand, again, sort of where things are headed. And so as I think about the power markets, you know, there are certainly if you look at some of the most traditional markets like Northern Virginia, you could be quoted lead times of roughly five to seven years to access power. And so that's where I think we've been creative and have tried to anticipate where new demand could develop, take a market like Atlanta, where we've been a meaningful investor and where we anticipated where opportunity would present itself. And so I think a lot of this really does come down to trying to think about access to power, be it renewable power, be it new gas fire generation power, understanding how do you minimize the infrastructure that needs to be built for any given data center and really trying to think years ahead as to where will the trends in this industry go? I fundamentally believe that we will be in a market where we don't ship natural gas thousands of miles away from where it is taken out of the ground, then build a new power generation facility and then build a long distance transmission line back to data centers. I fundamentally think there will be a trend toward co-location and the elimination of that infrastructure and where these data centers get built over time, I think will evolve. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And it strikes me we've been talking about for some time now what is really kind of the trendiest sector in infrastructure these days. But let's switch gears and talk a little bit, a sector which feels like it fell out of favor for a little while, but is now coming back. And I'm referring to transportation, except for you guys. It never really fell out of favor, did it? Because you've been steadily investing in transportation and you have been doing it throughout the covid years. And so I just wanted to get your take on the sector. To your point, we've been an active investor in transportation for years. We've now invested behind over 70 billion dollars of enterprise value of transportation businesses. As I look across our strategy, transportation is consistently represented roughly a third of what we do. We continue to be very excited about the underlying mega trend of behind the movement of people and goods and see many underlying sectors that we think are going to grow at multiples of GDP, take crews, take ports, both of which have grown roughly to GDP over the past 20 years, take even airports, which have grown roughly 60 percent faster than GDP. So we love the underlying sector and we think from a portfolio construction perspective, it's important to have that balance behind those businesses. And I just look at investing behind things like ports, airports, roads and rail. And I think that diversification is important. And then as you referenced, there are moments of dislocation and thinking about opportunities to be an active acquirer of assets in a dislocation like covid. That's why we were one of the most active investors in that window. Not many people were excited about buying airports, toll roads and rest stops in the midst of sort of a pre vaccine world. But I would just say we saw the underlying mega trends there and acted decisively. How are you thinking from a portfolio construction perspective? I'm still staying in transportation. How are you thinking about a mix of what, at least on the outside, look like more traditional assets such as some of the roads, networks and toll roads you have in Europe? And then something like your very recent acquisition of a safe harbor marinas, which looks less like that traditional infrastructure asset. How do you mix and match these different types of assets? Yeah, so listen, for us, we are very big believers in the importance of investing behind hard assets and concessions, businesses that have inflation protection, that have moats. And as I think about I think we see a lot of the same trends that we see in other traditional infrastructure assets in marinas, I would call marinas FBOs for boats. I think we all accept that the signature aviations and Atlantic's of the world are infrastructure. And we look at marinas and we see the same underlying assets, the stickiness of customers, lion's share, the super majority of revenues are coming from storage with customers that have been with safe harbor for in excess of seven years. And so we look at that asset class and we see it as all of the fundamental underlying demand drivers that you would want in a GDP plus growing transportation sector. We've actually got declining supply, roughly one percent per year declining supply. And fundamentally, we think the returns on invested capital are quite attractive there. And lastly, it's a sector that has yet to be consolidated in a safe harbor is roughly two X larger than its next largest competitor. And so we see a real opportunity there, very similar, I would say, to the way that we thought about the FBO sector. And last question on transportation, are there any sectors and or geographies that you're not active in, but you're eyeing or you want to make sure you're active in in a few years? Yeah, listen, I think we've got a great footprint across North America and Europe. I think there are certainly significant opportunities that we see in the Asia-Pacific region. You take a look at the underlying population growth stats, the economy growth stats, and just the need for significant infrastructure capital in that part of the world. And so if I looked out five or so years, I would expect to see us be a meaningful investor and transport in that region and again, providing the balance to what we're doing in the region is an important thing with with the transportation vertical. You know, one of the things I've always appreciated about your model and the infrastructure business line at Blackstone is you went open-ended, which in itself is still a little bit atypical. But then you went open-ended outside of, you know, the super core realm that is being pursued by the newest generation of open-ended strategies. I really wanted to explore that a bit because you've essentially been building businesses now within this open-ended framework. It's been, I think, six plus years into this journey. So how is that working out for you? Well, I think there's certainly an education process about thinking about infrastructure through an open-ended core and core plus lens. But fundamentally, I think when you just take a look at the sector, the open-ended fund structure aligns very well with the underlying asset class, you know, critical assets like ports and utilities aren't meant to be bought, fixed and flipped. And I think the perpetual structures allow us to preserve the optionality of closed-end funds where we have the ability to sell, but where we're not a for seller. Second thing I'd hit is that I think it is a in the open-ended fund structure is quite attractive for founders, families and corporates. It's been roughly 75% of what we've done. And I think it is attractive to those partners because we could be more of a strategic investor, think more like an entrepreneur than just being a financial investor. And lastly, I think the other thing that folks have appreciated over time is that it causes you to high-grade the types of businesses behind which you invest. If you're looking at a model for five years and you've got a turnaround strategy, you can make most businesses and infrastructure pencil out. Whereas when you think about looking at returns over a 10, 15, 20-year time horizon, it causes you to really focus on the underlying industry growth rates and to try to think more structurally. And it also causes you to high-grade the types of businesses behind which you invest. And so as I think about it, that thematic GDP plus growing lens that we take to the sector, I think really is amplified or the importance of it is underlined because of the open-ended fund structure. I know you mentioned optionality in terms of you're not a for seller and you can choose when to exit. I wonder, does the framework within which you operate, do you feel it really incentivizes you to hold on to these assets for longer, if not forever in some cases? Or I guess what I'm getting at is obviously if you get a good offer, you will exit. But otherwise, what would it take for you to exit? Yeah. So I think that the fundamental point here is that we are investors seeking to deliver great returns for our LPs. And so for us, we look at each investment every single quarter and try to decide, should we hold or should we sell? And sometimes the selling should be selling off stabilized assets that have been built in our operating and may not on an individual asset level hurdle toward the returns that we're targeting. So I would expect that you will see us be an active seller of underlying assets. It could be that you're selling those stabilized assets, but keeping the engine, the vehicle that is creating those attractive new opportunities. Or it could be a sale of an entire business. And I think you have seen us do a bit of that to date in our first six and a half years. And I would expect over the coming years, you should see active portfolio management. Actually, I want to also talk a little bit about your returns. I think it was in your Q4 results. I think it was Blackstone CEO, Steven Schwarzman. He said infrastructure was generating a 21% gross return for Blackstone in 2024, which was actually more than any of the firm's other strategies, if I'm not mistaken. And he also highlighted your strategy has delivered a 17% net return since inception. Now, those are pretty punchy figures for infrastructure, I think. I don't see any LP telling you, Sean, your return is too high. Stop doing that. I'd be curious to explore what is underpinning this very strong performance. So, if I just take a look at our strategy and what we have done, I think we've done a few things. Number one, we've been thematic, investing behind GDP plus growing sectors. And in many of those instances, sort of capturing the flag first, leading the QTS, take private before other transactions were done, or investing behind FBOs relatively early in the sector's focus on that. Or even more recently, utilities before the uptick in power demand and the expectations for rate-based growth. So, I think we've been focused on the mega trends, and I think leveraging the broader scale of Blackstone to spot those trends early has been a meaningful contributor to returns. Number two, we've backed industry-leading, generally founder-led businesses. And we are very big fans of investing behind and backing those founders, those families. And we think that's a key differentiator. I think it's probably one of the characteristics of a deal that has been most highly correlated with good returns for me over time. And then the third thing I'd say is, is that we spend a lot of time focused on how do we improve the operations of our portfolio companies? And so, if I were to think about something like a business like a Carex, our North American ports business, the efficiency efforts that are underway there, I think, have been a meaningful driver of returns for that transaction and have candidly allowed that company to become best in class from a margins perspective. So, I think it's a series of different things. Like anything in life, it's getting to a trend quicker than perhaps the pack or being willing to act like we were talking about with transportation in moments of dislocation. It's backing great founders and families, and it's certainly working with our companies to improve their operations. And do you feel that essentially you're always kind of doing those three things, right? You're always trying to get in early and backing kind of these founder-led businesses and then being operationally intensive, or is it the case that this fluctuates? Sometimes you're not being so operationally intensive, or sometimes you're not that early. How does that mix tend to play out? Yeah, I think about those as being three legs of the Blackstone infrastructure strategy stool. And of course, you can lean a little bit more on certain of those areas over time. But I think fundamentally, if you want to think about what makes a classic Blackstone infrastructure deal, those are the three primary legs of the stool. So when we caught up with you and the team in 2021, I remember towards the end of our interview, Blackstone president John Gray saying that over time he expected infrastructure would become a $100 billion business for Blackstone. And he said something to the effect of the asset class being very large and still being in the early days of it. And then he ended with, but it's not going to happen overnight for us. It never does. It doesn't feel like it's happening overnight, but you guys are at like $55 billion, if I'm not mistaken. So it doesn't feel like it's taking that long either. How do you feel about this $100 billion figure now five years down the line? You know, listen, we're incredibly proud of the growth of the infrastructure strategy at Blackstone. And it's a testament to the remarkable team that we have here. I'm not focused on size of our platform other than certainly scale helps us differentiate ourselves and break away a bit from the pack on transactions, witness something like an air trunk. I do think there are a lot of benefits to having a broader base to our business, you know, as we build our business in Europe and Asia, there will be learnings that we have from each of those different regions that we can then apply in North America or any other parts of the world. And Sean, just one last question. How do you feel infrastructure is being assessed at Blackstone these days? For example, I'm thinking about the BlackRock acquisition of global infrastructure partners, Larry Fink coming out and saying he sees infrastructure as the future of private markets. Do you feel the asset class has, let's say, a higher standing internally these days than five years ago? Well, listen, I think we as Blackstone are incredibly excited about the infrastructure asset class. As you referenced before, I think the industry is still in its early stages of development. And as I think about, you know, sort of the last 15 years, we've seen an 8x growth in the market from $150 billion to, you know, roughly $1.3 trillion today. I continue to see significant growth in front of us. And as we're out speaking with investors around the world, I think investors continue to see this as a very attractive asset class. And if you break it down, you know, it has four really important attributes, the first of which are returns. It's an asset class that has beaten global equities over the last 15 years. The second thing is, is it provides diversification. You think about the diversification effects of infrastructure, you compare it to equities, there's only a 0.6 correlation, real estate, roughly a 0.35 correlation, and actually a modest negative correlation with bonds. So I think there's a spot for it in portfolios. The third being the inflation protection that the asset class provides with hard assets and concessions where you've got real barriers to entry and an ability to pass along inflationary pressures. And then lastly, it's an asset class that has produced yield. And so when I think about the returns, the diversification, the inflation effect, and the yield, or RDIY, as we call it here, I think it's an asset class that certainly the historical tailwinds are explicable, and we continue to be very excited about the path ahead here at the firm. That, again, was Sean Klimchak, Blackstone's Global Head of Infrastructure.

### Is infra climbing up the risk curve?
**Publication Date:** 2025-03-06 08:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2597

**Full Transcript:**
Is infrastructure climbing up the risk curve? That's something we often hear. But what does that actually mean? Together with Infrastructure Investor America's editor, Zach Bentley, and Anne-Louise Peterson, senior reporter for the Energy Transition, we debate what asset class characteristics are falling by the wayside, which risks are perhaps not entirely evident to investors, and whether some high-risk assets are still infrastructure, or if their risk profile moves them beyond the confines of the asset class. I'm Bruno Alves, Infrastructure Investor's Editor-in-Chief, and this is the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. Hi, I'm Louise, Zach, good to see you, and welcome to the podcast. Thank you. So, you know, we as a team have, I feel, been on and off talking quite a lot over the years about whether infrastructure as an asset class is, you know, becoming riskier or climbing up the risk curve. And to me, I feel like the recent acquisition of London-listed fund, BBGI Global Infrastructure, by Canada's British Columbia Investment Management Fund, it's almost like a triggering event a bit because you look at that 56-asset portfolio made up of, you know, availability-style cash flows, you know, it's just a reminder of a bygone era, something that used to be pretty common across the asset class, and now it's almost like you're looking a little bit at an endangered species. And it's, you know, in a way, it's a great, great hook for us to hang on as we have this discussion. So, let's try and frame this for our audience. Let's analyze whether we feel infrastructure is becoming riskier. And to help kind of really contextualize it, which traditional asset class characteristics do you feel are now becoming harder to come by or falling by the wayside entirely? Zach, maybe you could start and then, Louise, then we'll get your thoughts also. I think one thing to say from the outset is we used to have a conversation in the industry dominated by brownfield or greenfield, and that conversation hardly exists anymore because I think to sort of get any meaningful alpha, you have to be doing some kind of greenfield. And naturally, that does send you a little further up the risk curve. Yeah, that's definitely happening. And Louise, what's on your mind in terms of higher risk for this asset class? Well, I'm always turning the discussion to energy transition. In this case, it would be about, I really do wonder a lot of these energy generating assets, how protected they really are. They would always say that, oh, you can't just add another solar farm or another wind farm to this area, but many times you can. And to some extent, it doesn't always matter so much because the grid is connected. So in a way, you're competing with so many other wind farms, so many other locations all the time. So you're not that protected and that matters particularly when we talk about merchant revenue being part of the revenue stack, that you are really dependent on something other than just something regulated and contracted to come in and save you, or at least save that extra cherry on the top to provide you your value add risk return. And actually, maybe Louise, related to what you're saying, is part of the greater risk in that because we keep adding and adding, we're perhaps affecting without even some of the knowledge of doing so, we're really affecting some of the power prices that are happening out there. You get a lot more volatility and sometimes negative power pricing because of so many generation assets at one moment. Yes, absolutely. Cannibalization is out there. It's very real, but everybody knows about it. The problem is, or the thing that may be harder to know about is, we've got an enormous pipeline of renewables coming online. How is that going to affect that merchant price five years down the line? Who can actually forecast that? And so when you have a revenue stack where a merchant makes up a significant portion, maybe up to 30%, sometimes even more if you're even more PE-like, that really isn't guaranteed in any way. It is just hopeful and hopefully you will go through and hopefully be there, but you just don't know. And I thought it was interesting researching this a little bit. Six years ago, I noticed that Frederik Blankbrood from ETHIC was already arguing that we really should let go of the whole value add core and core plus categories and say, is this contracted regulated or merchant and start using different terminology about how to categorize the risk return? Yeah. Well, I think the merchant example is very pertinent because I think we'll all remember a time when investors would just refuse to take that risk or would not want to take merchant risk because they could, by the way, things were subsidized, they could do that. But there was a time when this was firmly considered not an infrastructure type risk to take on. And then circumstances changed, people's hands got forced, et cetera. And of course, merchant risk is something you have to live with now. So I suppose another way of putting it is how much can you protect against it? How many assets can you get these days that have enough contractual protections in the context of renewables and the transition to minimize that merchant risk? Because that is what we're talking about, isn't it? We're talking about minimizing it, not eliminating exposure to it altogether, I feel. Yeah. I mean, I think there's a balance to be had, but I think there may be some people argue there may be certain assets that have to be merchant. I think something like battery storage and the picture of battery storage depends on which regulated market you're talking about. I go back to something Aaron Zubarty, CEO of the GIP portfolio company, he said a couple years ago after they secured financing for, I think at the time, the largest merchant battery storage asset ever built. And he was commenting on the merchant risk in battery storage. And he said that the storage is not and should not be lumped with contracted renewables. And he said that that's not what the storage play is, that it has to be volatile because of what it's doing for the grid. I would absolutely agree with that. It's the way I see people approach battery storage is not at all that they want to cut out the merchant risk. They are really going for it. And that's why we're seeing more PE like companies or strategies going in there and trying to get themselves some batteries. The question is whether there's an infrastructure. So how many of these battery projects are really infrastructure and how much of it is PE light, if you will? And I feel the energy transition is fertile here. So what else are you seeing where you are bumping up against this question, you know, this risk profile? It doesn't look very infrastructure. Where else in the energy transition would you say people should be paying attention to put it that way? You could argue that maybe offshore wind has turned into a place that definitely for those who don't know exactly what they're doing, has a lot more risk, a lot more development risk, a lot more greenfield risk than you would usually be comfortable with as an infrastructure investor. I think this is being recognized across the board at the moment. So maybe that's a little bit of an old fashioned example. But green hydrogen is another place. It's been very up there. I think fewer and fewer proper infrastructure funds are going there. But you do have funds calling themselves infrastructure that are invested in green hydrogen. And the risk there is just simply too high. It seems. Yeah, I would add to that, again, something that may have been an excitable asset a few years ago, but people have turned away from a little bit, something like EV charging infrastructure. Again, kind of like storage, it does depend on which market you're talking about. But there is a lot of merchant or hope, as we were talking about before, there's a lot of hope involved in that people are plugging into your assets. Yeah, I think that's valid. With the exception sometimes in Europe, I think you can find some concession like structures around EV charging when some governments get involved. And that immediately turns it into infrastructure because it gets through the merchant risk, so to speak, and the volatility. But it's probably not the majority here. So, OK, so we're coming across a few risks, Zach, you mentioned at the very beginning that we used to talk a lot about Greenfield, Brownfield and, you know, this time when you could just invest mostly in operational assets without doing much is over. So you always have to take a bit of that development risk these days. And then we got to talking about merchant and the lack of downside protection. I feel another risk as platforms have shot up the agenda as a way of doing things. And also now with some of the newer strategies, again, on the energy transition is also scale up risk, which is another way of talking about growth infrastructure equity. And that seems to be becoming more popular. And you wrote about platforms not that long ago, Zach. So maybe it's worth recalling some of the, you know, of the risks that you identified then. Yeah, I think the risk with platforms is you build up a vast pipeline of projects that perhaps never see the light of day. And then we can get into all the risks associated with renewables projects in terms of connection to the grid. But you end up with large development pipelines that maybe aren't going to be developed. I guess the benefit of platforms in this respect and your certainty is in the data center world as well, is that actually you can build up a portfolio, half of which is what people are calling stabilized assets, operational stabilized has become the new word for operational. And then there's the greenfield development side of businesses. And so you're getting the revenue in from the stabilized assets and at the same time, you can build out the platform. And there's also an analyse, we've discussed this between us. There's also the type of, the part of the scale up risk that is essentially where infra and PE meld isn't there. And in the energy transition, you see this in some of the newer businesses where you're also just trying to grow something as in the contracts are there, KKR, what they're doing with Zenobi is an obvious example. They bought something, it has contracts, et cetera, but they want to grow that business by 10 X or whatever it is. And that is kind of a private equity risk in a way, or certainly a growth equity risk. And I feel the transition is a place where you see a lot of that. On the other hand, you do have to platform to get anywhere. So it's a risk I think they've got to take. And it's also a risk that you could argue it's well managed within the infrastructure sector. It's been seen before. It's nothing new, really. Maybe the scale is new, but then so the scale is new in everything these days. I don't know. The scale-up risk is not so much my concern. I think where I'm most concerned is that when people go out and present these strategies to the LPs, that they have a language to describe what they're selling that is perhaps a little more accurate than what they are showing up with. So as long as everybody knows that this is a scale-up risk, that's not a concern. But if what's being scaled is stacked rather than infrastructure assets, so it has a revenue stack that consists of a lot of merchant risk, that's a different proposition than just scaling up a contracted asset class. Yeah, that's right. And that brings us back to downside. Well, I guess you're hinting at that, you know, the revenue stack isn't maybe being made as clear in some of these assets as maybe it should be. Is that a fair way of putting it? I think so. I've seen, you know, there's a very cute way of talking about a merchant nose or a merchant tail and, you know, oh, it's a little bit of extra. And people keep talking about the merchant's slice of the revenue stack is a little bit of an extra, but really it is becoming quite prominent. And it's sometimes, the lines are sometimes a little bit blurred on just how much of this merchant can you trust and can you rely on in five, seven, 10 years, 12 years, even for some of the infrastructure funds. It's a long time to rely on something where you have no control at all. Even when you're not on merchant risk and you have a PPA, I was reminded about something that was said. I was at the Infocast Clean Energy Investment Summit in Houston last year, and there's a representative from the US subsidiary of the Japanese group, Jera. So not an infrastructure fund, but investing in similar assets. And he was saying sort of, if you take a solar asset, which has a 30, 35 year life, and you have a 15 year PPA, he was saying that you're naturally taking speculation on what prices are going to be from year 16 through to 35. And so, yeah, you might be able to sign another PPA after that, but really you don't know. And that's also quite, quite a risk that's being taken. And he was saying most of your IRR is going to be driven in those 15 years. You don't know what's coming after that. Yes. And of course, most assets would have a PPA in there too. And then they would have the merchant's slice on top of that. So even those solar projects for 15 years might still have a merchant bit added to them, which would of course help a little bit, hopefully with the IRR over the 15 years. But I think what we're also saying is this isn't just about, in case somebody is listening and thinking, well, you know, this is maybe about some of the newer energy transition assets and what's coming clear is, yes, you have some of the newer assets like batteries and they arguably are something else that falls entirely off the spectrum. But we're also talking that this is present, this higher risk with merchants, et cetera, in the common stuff or the more common stuff that people were used to, wind, solar, et cetera. Right. That is effectively what we're saying. Yeah. And we've been talking about this for a number of years, but PPA contracts, the terms of them, the length in which they usually sign for, I think 15 is a luxury. And often these days you're looking at more like seven or eight and maybe 60% of that is actually under contract. And that raises a very important question, which is, you know, is this infrastructure enough as a, you know, a risk return profile? Because it is a short tenure in many of these cases. So let me flip the question nowadays. What can you do and where should you go if you still want to buy into some of those more traditional infrastructure characteristics, ensure you have downside protection, et cetera? I think coming from the US space, I think there's a great opportunity in the utility sector, which is highly fragmented, but is regulated and maybe in some of the larger opportunities regulation is forcing some of these returns down, but it's still a sort of high single, low double digit opportunity, which would be the ability to sort of generate further returns from delving further into the energy transition space while having a traditional regulated utility. Yeah, that's fair. And Elise, what are you, you know, what's catching your eye? Where you have barriers to entry, better barriers to entry in something like coal logistics and in waste management. You don't suddenly just pop out of nowhere and have trucks ready to collect the garbage that people throw out. So these things are where I think we might see some development and where people go in and it's fully contracted all the way through and has very strong infrastructure characteristics. You may have ports as well. There'd be some various things with the ports that you, you know, you cannot just put up another port. Even airports might be something that people might return to, but definitely I think the whole energy transition space that the energy generation space and the storage space may not be where people go if they want core and core plus structures. Are we saying a bit also that if you look at the context of the megatrends, broadly speaking, so the transition in digital and because you have a lot of people piling in and also a lot of assets being, you know, developed, we can go outside of the transition. We see some problems in fiber if you want to get these downside kind of protections or barriers to entry, forget about it. So is it something to be watchful for? Because these are the megatrends, but actually, you know, the upside is deal flow and lots of tailwind and the downside is maybe letting go or having to look very hard to implement some of those infrastructure characteristics. I think if you're a fund and wanting to tap into these megatrends, you kind of have to accept that there is an increased risk there. There is way more development that's needed, whether you're talking about transition or day centers or the like, there aren't so many operational assets that you could just tap into and get a benefit from immediately. There's going to need to be some more development risk. And with that comes to have a contracted risk as well. Is it just development though? Because when I was hearing Anne Louise talk about some of her examples, it's also about barriers to entry, right? It's just, I feel the barriers to entry are just not there to the same extent to go, you know, to go to your trucks example, Anne Louise, that you just don't pop up with a fleet of trucks, but you pop up with a solar farm or even, you know, a fiber line as we've spoken. I think there is an element of that also at play here, isn't it? I would say so. I think that's the biggest difference. Absolutely. And I don't necessarily think it's something bad. It's just be careful what we're talking about. And if it's slightly more PE, if it's slightly less traditional infrastructure, just be honest about it, say what it is. And I'm sure that there are people out there who can still see a value in investing in renewable assets, regardless of what we call them or what the revenue stack looks like. They just need to know. It's funny because this line resonated with me when I interviewed recently Petya Nikolova, who heads up infrastructure for five of New York City's retirement systems. And there's a couple of things that caught my ear and one that she kind of stressed looking at deals on deal by deal basis or characteristics and things like downside protection, so on and so forth. But she seemed relatively open about this shift up the risk curve in the sense that she said this is the way the assets are changing and it's what society needs and we're going there following. But also she felt there was enough, and of course this is relative, enough downside, enough protection to still anchor it in the infrastructure round for her, obviously for her and her portfolio. And I thought that was quite interesting. Maybe a way for us to wrap up is when we're discussing going up the risk curve, okay, are we still saying most of these investments are in the infrastructure up here or are we actually saying some of them are out there? And I think we're kind of saying that batteries are maybe in a place that is beyond the higher end of the infrastructure spectrum, at least in some cases, right? I think that is a case that can be argued. Also the duration of those projects are sometimes quite short, five to seven years in some cases. So yes, arguably they are looking a lot like PE. But on the other hand, it's worth noting that it's not as if private equity has been busy trying to come and say, oh, we'll take this over. So it may still belong in the infrastructure realm for a while, uncontested. Yeah, I think it's more just that the realm has widened. I think people, as Anna would say, are coming to eat this lunch. It is still infra. I think you're accepting it upon yourself that when you're going into some of these assets or some of these funds that there is going to be a greater risk. And if you don't want that, there's other more core-like opportunities for you. Yeah. And also, could PE come and eat our lunch, so to speak? Because we haven't been talking about skillset much where we're focusing solely on risk. But just because you're PE and you're used to taking on higher risk doesn't necessarily mean you could come and take this kind of higher risk and have the right skillset to get it to a good place. I think that's something I would say. Yeah, I think where we've seen more PE-like investments in the transition space, at least, is more towards maybe climate tech is the best description for it. More or more just before those assets really get to an energy transition asset, never mind an infrastructure asset. And I don't know if it's a valid point, but the skillset that infrastructure investors have had to acquire in the past five years has also changed enormously. If you look at how to get a battery project going and get that stack sorted, this is not easy. The whole PPA thing is not trivial. So the skillset, I think, of everybody is changing. And of course, there can be PE people coming to infrastructure too, and they are there. And there will be some infrastructure people going more and more PE as they find that they can make that work. Why wouldn't they? Yeah. I think that's a good point to end on. Anne-Louise, Zak, thanks very much for coming on and sharing your insights. Good to see you. Thank you. You too.

### NYC BAM: ‘Infra has the best inflation passthrough in private markets’
**Publication Date:** 2025-02-20 08:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2598

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Alves and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. In today's episode, I sit down with Petra Nikolova, Deputy CIO and Head of Infrastructure at the office of the New York City Comptroller's Bureau of Asset Management. The Bureau oversees the investments of the five New York City retirement systems, which have a collective $280 billion of assets under management, of which $8.4 billion are invested in infrastructure. Petra has led the infrastructure program since inception and has now had the opportunity to see it perform in a high-inflation environment. That forms part of our discussion, alongside infrastructure's role as a diversifier in the system's portfolios, how to thoughtfully manage exposure to the megatrends of digital infrastructure and the energy transition, and also whether infrastructure as an asset class is climbing up the risk curve. Hi, Petra, welcome to the podcast. Hi, Bruno, thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. So you're actually the first LP that we are having on the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. And maybe my first question could be a little bit broad, and you could just tell our listeners, what do you want your infrastructure portfolio to do in the context of the pension funds that you manage, you know, versus your other asset classes? Absolutely. So the way we structure the infrastructure, and the reason why it exists, if you will, is that we wanted to provide inflation linkage. We want the asset class to provide diversification. And we also look at downside protection, and the way we think about it also is superior. We'd like to think we generate that risk-adjusted returns. So a few things to pick up on there, inflation, you know, has become, has obviously been under the spotlight. And then infrastructure is inflation, hedging capabilities along with it. We now have performance data from an inflationary period. So how did infrastructure actually perform for you? I must say that I was very excited in a way to go through that period, because we haven't been as an asset class through high inflation period. So with that, to your point, there are more observations, more research, more data points that prove that the asset class actually works in that inflation linkage. So in our portfolio, we have seen the inflation pass through the different revenue models. So we've seen that pass through, say, strong market positions or contracted structures or regulated also assets. So we've seen that. And also there is more research now. You can see, for example, that during the 2022-2023 period, infrastructure as an asset class, this includes all strategies, is generating around 9%, whereas other asset classes on the private side are generating either low single digits or even negative returns. So this shows you how well infrastructure withstood that period. Well, we're still in that period, but for 2022-2023. OK, is it fair to say then it's got the strongest inflation pass through capabilities, you know, across private asset classes or how would you class that in those terms? I would agree with that. That's what we have seen in our portfolio. And some research has also pointed to that. Of course, we are not out of it. I think what we're seeing right now is continuation of that environment. So the test continues. But so far, the results have been strong. And you also mentioned diversification. And I'm thinking, you know, given the way public markets are shrinking and that, again, infrastructure is not the only other private asset class offering diversification benefits. How would you assess the diversification you get from infrastructure? And that's a great point because the public markets are shrinking and also it's becoming more concentrated to add to your point. So the private asset classes are adding more diversification as well. And to answer your question directly about infrastructure, how is that different? Of course, there are different correlation matrices and we see all that and that looks very good for infrastructure. But even as we think about the deal flow that we see, for example, energy transition, that falls primarily in infrastructure. I mean, you can see some of it in private equity, some of it like buyouts or venture. But that theme that has such a huge need in the trillions for investments that I believe is going to be primarily infrastructure or digital infrastructure, which plays on the AI trend. And again, you can see that in private equity to a certain extent, but a lot of it is going to be infrastructure. And of course, you have downside protection infrastructure that you don't really see in the same way in other asset classes. Yeah, and I'm very keen to get into those two sectors actually very, very soon. I just have just a couple of questions I wanted to just to get a sense of how you're allocating to infrastructure and the pacing of it. So I think when we caught up with you last year, the five schemes that you managed, their infra allocation stood more or less between four and five percent. I'm just wanting to get a sense of growth and how you envisage growth for those allocations. So as you pointed out, Bruno, this was relatively recent. So last year when we spoke, we had a new, at that time, new allocation to infrastructure that took us to these levels. And for background, a few years prior to that, our allocations pretty much doubled. So what this means is that we still have room to grow within the current allocation. So we'll see where we are. We are hoping over the next few years to be fully deployed so that, to your question, saying the next strategic asset allocation, that allocation increases. But right now we have enough room and our main goal would be to continue delivering very strong results so that there is a solid reason for the allocation to be increased. Sure, no, that makes sense. And just on pacing, I mean, what we've been hearing a bit or we heard a bit over 2024 is that the denominator effect wasn't so much the issue last year, but lack of distributions was a problem. And so I wanted to know, how is it for the schemes you manage? And have you been able to maintain the pace of investing that you wanted to or you hit some of these roadblocks? Due to these dynamics that we just discussed and the fact that our allocation was increased quite a bit over the last few years, we continue to deploy evenly over a period of time so that we can achieve vintage diversification. Therefore, we haven't downsized our investments per year and we continue to actively deploy in the market. So we are active, we continue doing deals. And I'm also happy to share that we actually have seen some strong exits. So it's an active market. So now keen to discuss how the asset class has been evolving. And you've mentioned energy transition and digital. And one of the things that resonated with us, and I know a few other people in the market, when we interviewed you last year, you mentioned that you really wanted to see an energy transition fund that is clearly infrastructure. And so kind of a year later, I'm just wondering, how are you feeling about that now and are things any clearer? So the market continued to evolve. We continue having discussions with various groups that are focused on energy transition. And what the change has been is that there is much more focus, I would say, on what the mandate for the fund is. What are the subsectors that are targeted? And equally importantly, what are the ones that are not targeted by this particular strategy? And the other aspect of it is, I would say, much more focus on articulating the infrastructure characteristics of the strategy and downside protection, right? Because this is really key for infrastructure. And some of these parameters were not that clear last year, and I would say to me anyway, and this year they're becoming more clear. I would say, however, that we are seeing this segmentation where you have the renewables and these funds have been there for a while that target renewables. There are funds that are targeting renewables and some of the newer themes in energy transition. And now we are seeing also more firmly energy transition funds focused on the newer themes in energy transition. And that I think it's very positive because it goes to what is the risk and how LPs expect to be compensated for the risk they're taking. So as you have this differentiation, this becomes clear. I think of them as, you know, like growth infrastructure. So to your question, like, is this clear infrastructure? It's I think these particular energy transition funds, they would be probably on the higher spectrum of risk, but also with a higher expectation. Yeah, no, I think that's totally fair because some of the scale up risk that some of these funds introduce, and that's what I also wanted to to just check with you. So you're kind of seeing that scale up risk. It puts you at the higher end of the infrastructure. But I guess you're seeing enough of the downside protection and enough of the traditional characteristics to be comfortable and not just, you know, something that goes outside of the infraspace or doesn't do the basics. Right. It's higher risk, but it's still doing some of what you want out of the asset class, I guess. That's exactly right. And you can have a conversation around exactly what the downside is, right? Deal by deal, depending on what the strategies, what other risks are being taken. And again, these are, I would say, topsy approached and hopefully there will be mitigated. We don't have a lot of track record there, right? So it's a little bit also where infrastructures and asset class was a few years ago, less track record. So now this particular space, I think, is at that stage. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. And then we have sort of these new AI infrastructure strategies, very data center heavy, but mixing digital infra and power. And I think that kind of further clouds a little bit the risk return spectrum. And so I'm curious how you are viewing that, you know, those strategies, but also the way digital infra is evolving because power is becoming a big part of it also. And again, sort of how you see that fitting into what you want out of your infrastructure bucket. That's a great point. We had been observing this convergence, if you will, of the AI trend and then the power because of what you just outlined. And I think that convergence is going to become more prominent. We've seen the expectations for increase in power demand in the U.S. that hasn't been the case for many, many decades now. But I think the way we view it is we go back to the fundamentals of infrastructure, right, and ask ourselves, what risks are we taking? Right. Very similar to the discussion on energy transition. How is the downside protected? For example, we talk about data centers, right? Is the land there? Is the power there? If not yet, how is this going to be secured? Right. So you could have the structural protections of the asset class. And for the hyperscalers, what we've seen is multi-decade potentially contracts. So I think that it would depend also on how these deals are structured, as always. Yeah. Do you think in that sense, and this is tied to my next question, but I'm thinking of the megatrends in particular and kind of the scale up risk and development that you have to do. And so do you think in a sense, do you feel that the asset classes risk return spectrum is sort of slowly being pushed up? Obviously, you have core offerings that are still out there in the market. But sometimes there is a sense that maybe, yes, that the asset class is moving up the risk curve, as it were. I think it's more about changing needs in our society than the asset class necessarily moving up the curve, because different strategies can be at different points in that curve. But as we think about data centers, they didn't exist to the extent they exist today or will exist tomorrow, because when was charge GPT adopted broadly, it was just a few years ago. It's amazing to think that it was so recent. So I think that we see rapid changes that necessitate rapid change in infrastructure. So I don't necessarily think that the asset class is moving in a direction that it shouldn't be moving, say it's becoming more technology based and driven. Although, of course, the drivers are there. But in terms of the structure, you can still have less risky strategy. More core, more structured and mitigated risks. And to your point, higher risk spectrum, more speculative, more development. So, again, as an asset class, I don't necessarily think it's moving as an asset class to the higher end. Yeah, no, and that's a really good point about changing needs and catering to that. But let me ask you about how your portfolio is shaping up or how other portfolios can shape up, because it obviously seems, you know, nowadays that everybody is doing this, doing energy transition, doing digital generalists, specialists, everybody. And so are you concerned a bit about concentration risk or, you know, how your portfolio might become too exposed? And if so, how do you try and mitigate that? Yes, you're absolutely right. We are monitoring this very carefully, these dynamics. And we have historically been pulling between 20 and 25 percent energy transition over the years. But digital was really the asset class that increased very, very quickly in our exposure. And the other dynamic there is that valuations are also increasing because data centers are so much in demand. So you have more assets in that bucket, the digital, but also valuations increasing more quickly. So to your point, exposure is increasing quite a bit. So how do we mitigate that? What we do is we spend a lot of time understanding what the fund that we want to invest in potentially would in turn invest in. And of course, guidelines are broad. But what is truly the target portfolio? And of course, these are investment periods of three to five years. Of course, these are blind pools. But we really try to understand the thesis at the time that we invest. Importantly, we have had longstanding preference for diversified funds. Why? Not only because it gives us more diversification, but it protects us as the world changes and you have different drivers in different geographies and different sectors. So we have generally preferred diversified funds, which means that we haven't invested in a digital specialty fund or anti-transition specialty fund, but yet we have a lot of exposure. And one of the reasons not to invest is also the concern that this may get too high. And finally, we also don't want to not take advantage of good opportunities in these sectors if we see such opportunities. So we have a co-investment program and there we can see specific deals. We can not a blind pool, right? So this is how we approached it. Yes, we are concerned about exposure, but at the same time, we don't want to miss on opportunities that we think are going to be great addition to the portfolio. So we analyze these specifically and that's how we add. In fact, we added last year a platform, the renewables. So energy transition, if you will, although other themes. And that's how we approach that. OK, so I have a couple of last topics I wanted to cover with you. This one also is a follow up to something you mentioned last year in our interview. You had mentioned that you wanted to increase commitments in 2024 to mid-market funds. So first question, I wanted to ask how that went and if it went successfully or as you expected. But also, what are you seeing in mid-market funds that you're not getting elsewhere? So we did invest in mid-market last year and we also invested in some of our longer standing partners that happen to be now larger. So we have invested in different parts of the market, if you will. And going back to the point of diversification, that is a very important point for us, for the middle market, because you can get assets that are just smaller and have different drivers than some of the large assets that other parts of the portfolio can deliver for us. You can also have different strategies like platform creation, et cetera, for the middle market that are probably a little bit harder when you become a certain size. And finally, also the exit routes are probably different to a certain extent. So as we think about middle market, that's what we see and why we want it in our portfolio. And I just want to make the point that from a return point of view, we expect great returns, both from our mid-market, from our large cap, from all the managers in our portfolio. And that's why we partner with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I understand. So it's not so much a matter of going to the middle market for outperformance or something of that sort. Yeah. Just different needs, I guess. Yes. And we go with who do we believe the best manager is and that they will deliver the returns that they have targeted. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And one last question. You've been an LP in funds managed by the likes of Global Infrastructure Partners, BlackRock, Actis, DIF, all of them have been through, you know, this wave of consolidation in one way or other that is sweeping the industry. So, you know, how as an LP in many of these funds, how are you experiencing this? What is your take on all of this consolidation that we saw in 2024 and in previous years? So you're right. I mean, it's not new. We've seen consolidation before. It has been in infrastructure. It has been in private credit, a lot of it. And I think we are going to see even more. The market conditions are difficult. That's one. Number two, platforms are trying to grow and become more multi-asset and infrastructure to just focus on infrastructure here as opposed to the other private brinks, as we discussed, different characteristics. So if you have a private equity platform that is oriented to growth, you can add an infrastructure that can add more income, different risk return profile, inflation linkage, as we discussed in the beginning. So it's a different set of attributes that can be complementary to the other product offerings. And of course, you have the public companies that are trying to either expand or enter the private market space. And we talked about that as well. So I think that that trend will continue. And my view hasn't changed on how this would impact the firms that have been part of that trend. I think that there are going to be synergies in some places. So there is positive and there would be complementary products. And then there are questions, right, how the culture work and how would the strategies change potentially. But I think it's like probably a little bit early to assess the exact impact on the different strategies and players. Yeah, no, I think that's fair. And also, you know, a good note to end on. Petya, thanks so much for coming on the podcast. And it was great to see you again. Thank you so much, Bruno.

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Aldrich, and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. Fundraising for unlisted, closed-ended vehicles hit a low point in 2024, with circa $92 billion raised. Last year's tally was the lowest since 2015, and the first time in nearly a decade that fundraising totals have dipped below the $100 billion mark. It's also the second year in a row that fundraising has contracted. That, combined with ever-larger amounts of time spent raising these funds, raises several important questions about the direction of the market. To help me answer those questions, I'm joined by Infrastructure Investor Deputy Editor Kalayipi Gorntis and Americas Editor Zach Bentley. I'm Bruno Aldrich, Senior Editor of Infrastructure Investor, and this is the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. Hi Zach, Kalayipi, welcome. Hi, Bruno. So, this is going to be our first team podcast of the year, and we're going to start by talking about fundraising. We recently published our full year 2024 fundraising figures for unlisted, closed-end structures. It's fair to say this wasn't a great year, but there is lots to talk about. So let me just frame this for our listeners for a moment. So how bad was 2024? Basically it was the worst fundraising year since 2015. So around $92 billion got raised in 2024. So this was the first time fundraising dipped below the $100 billion fundraising mark in nearly a decade. So 2024 was considerably worse than the $128 billion raised in 2023, and about $100 billion less than the $194 billion raised in 2021, which is still the asset class' high watermark. So before we get started, in earnest, just a small caveat, we obviously, and we and a few others, what we're doing here is we are recording funds that hit a final close in a certain year. So obviously this doesn't mean that all of this money was raised in 2024. It wasn't. This is just the point at which these funds have hit a final close. And obviously this approach, you know, it has, I think, obvious limitations, but listeners should be aware. So Zach Klaipi and whoever wants to go first, go for it. I think we sort of expected to end up here, didn't we? I think it's interesting because we did expect to end up here, but I think, I'm not sure we did until maybe the latter half of 2024. And I was just thinking that, you know, when we were reporting the 2023 figures and how bad it was, I'm not sure we expected 2024 to be worse. That's a good point. And I do remember, you know, speaking to people, especially in the first half of last year, and, you know, I think sentiment was more positive. People were kind of not just hoping, but, you know, kind of feeling that things were a bit better. Yeah. So I think it was probably quite disappointing that 24 was even more so than 23. And the other thing I thought, I think most people like being right. But I think in this case, we may have preferred to have missed the mark when we predicted that 24 would be worse. Definitely agree there. Zach, I mean, this is, you know, yet again, a story of mega funds closing or not closing in this case, isn't it? And this is why we are where we are. Yeah. I think if we're talking about expectations, perhaps the finger should be pointed at ourselves necessarily more than the market dynamics itself. I think we kind of just expected a better 2024 because of 2023, as Goliath was just hinting at. I don't think many of the issues that were there in 2023 really cleared up in 2024 or I think as I wrote at some point last year, we should actually see many of these dynamics here to stay for quite a while. So I think in terms of mega funds, we have many in the market. Some have made better strides than others. And some we should expect to see close in the first quarter of this year. And others, you know, we might still be talking about them in the podcast this time next year. I thought it was interesting that, yes, some of the dynamics haven't dissipated that we saw in 23 and 24. But one that has and yet it still didn't help was the denominator effect. So people I spoke with last year said, you know, that's not really the problem anymore. That wasn't the problem last year as it was in 23. The main problem has been lack of exits. So that was the main thing. I think an additional dynamic to that is, as we well know in the asset class, and this is a big tailwind for our asset class, that many LPs are yet to even get started on the infrastructure journey and there's so much untapped potential for GPs to raise capital here. But those LPs that have been investing for many years in this market, those portfolios are now at maturity. Those portfolios for a lot of LPs are at where the LPs want it to be. So unless you're seeing all the funds realize their assets and the LPs need to top up this allocation, there's not necessarily a need to commit for many LPs. Yeah, that's a fair point. I think it really ties in with the distributions issue that the exits issue, Clio P was highlighting. We keep hearing that the buyer-seller gap is improving, but is it improving quickly enough and with a scale needed to then allow for funds to flow again? Obviously, things are not easy. I think this year demonstrates that. But I am in agreement with Clio P. I think there was kind of an optimism in H1 that sort of dwindled as we went to H2 and reality cemented itself that I think probably infected us, but were kind of a symptom of dealing with the market. So I think it was definitely there. So one thing I think is really a mark of this fundraising year. And for me, it's kind of become, as I mentioned in my weekly, probably one of, if not the most important metric in fundraising today is time on the road. So, you know, how long it's taking managers to raise funds. Because what happened in 2024 is that the funds closed last year, took 31.3 months to reach a final close. So that's over two and a half years. And that's a big jump from the 17.6 months it took managers on average to close a fund from 2019 to 2023. And I think this has all sorts of implications. I'll throw a few questions for us to discuss. But if this, you know, remains as high time on the road as it has been in 2024, I mean, can smaller managers stomach all the costs that come with this one thing, let alone first time managers? And you know, and what happens to fund targets? Because they had been steadily increasing until, let's say 2022. But it takes you absolutely ages to, you know, the larger your target, the more it'll take to hit in many ways. So does that mean targets will reverse course? I don't know how you feel, but I really do think this metric is really the one to watch now going forward, or one of the most important ones to watch. I do think that the duration is the fundamental thing that's, you know, slowing your book. Because it's slow, it's having such an effect on the fundraising figures and what the performance ends up being on a yearly basis. I would think that as long as the macroeconomic environment stays the way it is and has been, I think we can probably expect these longer fundraising periods to continue. Yeah. What do you think, Zach? I think the 31 months on the road figure that came out in our statistics is really the most, probably the most remarkable piece of data that's out there in that presentation. I was meeting with an investor relations contact from a multi-billion dollar fund recently, and they've just started fundraising. And that guy was telling LPs, expect two years. There's now the expectation management that you should see us on the road for two years, because this is the reality. I think you can see GPs also with regards to targets adapting to this, you know, it was launched a little while ago. But if you look at Digital Bridge for Fund 3, they put the target at $8 billion, having raised $8 billion for the previous effort, iSquared having raised $15 billion for the previous effort, have now put a $15 billion target on Fund 4. There's not the jumping of targets that we necessarily used to see just three years ago. Yeah. No, I think you're right. There is already some adaptation effort going on, because we know that LPs, they ask questions about this. A lot of time spent on the road is, you know, resources diverted from doing deals, doing other stuff. But it's quite incredible. If you look at, you know, the biggest fund close of 2024, which was Anton's fifth flagship, the timeline is pretty revelatory, really. I mean, it took them about half a year to hit the $5 billion mark, which was half of their target. It then took them another year and change to reach $9 billion at the end of 2023. So they got to 90% there. And then it took them all of 2024 to raise that final $1.2 billion. So you can see the law of diminishing returns and, you know, some LP, this is not picking on Anton, but somebody could legitimately ask, why didn't you just stop at that 90% target, right, instead of keeping going? And I think this is going to repeat itself a little bit. Yeah, I think we saw that earlier in 2024 with Brookfield's second transition fund, where it got to a $10 billion first close pretty quickly, which I think they announced last February or so. And then by their own admission, Brookfield's own admission, fundraising during the rest of the year for the fund was a lot slower and is a bit closer to that still $10 billion mark. And so it's just a demonstration of that time that's being taken on the road. I think an interesting kind of exception here, in a way, is Omniscapital that recently closed their fifth fund above their hard cap on 1.8 billion euros. And the hard cap was 1.65 billion. Their target size for this latest fund was nearly three times as large as their predecessor fund, which had closed on $660 million. And I also think it's interesting that despite, you know, the long fundraising process for them, deployment seems to be progressing pretty quickly, because at the time that they announced their final close, they've already invested in seven portfolio companies. And the target for the fund is to invest in 10. So there's that upside. But also, I think it's interesting, because if we take that within the context of our fundraising report, we saw that there was a significant drop in the percentage of renewable energy funds, renewable strategies. So where we had 40%, I believe, accounting for the funds closed, compared to 73% that was in 2023. But yet the Omnisc fund, you know, is energy transition focused. So it kind of goes against that trend, I guess. Yeah, that's something that is also going to be interesting to see as, you know, this year and the next. Is this the beginning of a trend? It's true, we had a big drop in the fact that all sector focused funds, just 40% was renewables compared to 73. Is that going to continue? You know, we've certainly had headwinds in the sector and lots of negative headlines. So it's going to be really interesting to see if that's going to take hold. I would say maybe a 70% of fundraising being renewables is not a healthy place to be at for the asset class in general, either. That's a good point, Zach. And I think this is so, you know, just to contextualize further, in 2021, 53% of all sector focused funds were renewables funds. So that's kind of more in line. In 2022, actually 43% of sector focused funds were renewables funds. So that's pretty much in line with 2024. So you're right, 2023 is an outlier here. I just want to add one further thing about the time being taken. One of our conferences last year, a Canadian investor said that they were concerned by what they saw as fundraising distractions by managers, that managers were getting caught up in the fundraising process, and that they preferred managers to end fundraising, maybe slightly below target, and then concentrate on the investment process rather than continuing to try and meet target. Yeah, and that's precisely what I was alluding earlier on when I referenced Anton, but really Anton is just an example. I think in 2025, you're going to look at a lot of the funds closed, and especially those with larger targets, and you're going to find a relatively long slog to get to the end. This is what I was alluding to. And Zach, you're kind of saying, yeah, managers are adapting, they're kind of keeping targets, they're not letting them balloon. So it's stagnating in a way, at some point, if it reverses course, then we have the market actually going into reverse, right? So it's going to be a really interesting dynamic that, am I the only one where this feels a little bit like there's a bit of cognitive dissonance going on, because, you know, we keep hearing that there's room for growth, Zach, you alluded earlier on, LPL locations still to be done for infrastructure, lots of capital demand for AI infrastructure, energy transition, et cetera, and then two years in a row of fundraising numbers going down and down. And that's something, again, I wrote in my weekly, but I'd love to hear what you guys think about that. I think the two dynamics can coexist together, that there's plenty of room for growth, there's plenty of LPs who haven't even allocated to the asset class, nevermind under allocated. And there's plenty of LPs who will say in a survey that they want to increase more to infrastructure. And yet for reasons that are to do with both the LPs and the GPs, that doesn't necessarily happen. I wonder if the fact that continuation funds have been such a big part of the story lately because of this whole fundraising environment, if we're maybe missing out or not counting the LP capital that goes into those ones. No, we do count them depending on how they are raised. They might not make it into the top 10, but what we do, but there are, you know, there are various structures and, you know, money put directly into platforms. That's a good question. It's harder to track and certainly competes directly with money allocated to funds to a certain extent. So those dynamics, I mean, your larger point, I think, stands. So what are we saying here, Zach, you seem to be saying there's going to be a pickup, but we're not going to predict exactly when that's going to take place. Look, there's a lot of mega funds in market right now. And I think we can confidently expect that this time next year when we sit down to record this podcast, these numbers will look significantly better. If you take GIP, which is targeting 25 billion, we should expect that to close in the next few months. CIP should close this year, EQT targeting 20 billion, they should close soon. And so I think we can confidently say that these numbers will look better. I don't think that necessarily means that when we talk this time next year, we should be celebrating with we're back, baby. I think if we have a blowout year, so to speak, that will be followed by another few years of relative low. And perhaps this is the cycle that we're now in for quite some years in the foreseeable future. Yeah, exactly. So this, I think, becomes the new dynamic, perhaps for a while, which is, you know, a great year followed by a not so great year. But we should bear in mind that we were on completely on an upwards trajectory, never mind the blip that was COVID, and that ended up being a small blip in terms of fundraising and then 2021, 2022, it was all up, up, up. But now we may actually be on more of a, you know, up and down trajectory, right? Yeah, I think that's exactly what our growth will look like. Might not be a clear narrative to tell from the next few years. And I think I would just add that maybe it's a combination of two things. One, the asset class, I know it's still fairly young, but it is also maturing. So that combined, again, with what I said before about the macroeconomic environment, you know, maybe things will be a little flat for the next couple of years, at least. I wonder if you think also if some of this may or may not reverse course with what I'll just call thematic fundraising in a very general sense. I mean, we've all heard about, you know, the multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure vehicles being planned, which is supposedly a combo of digital infra and power slash transition investments all in one. I mean, risk profile of some of these funds to be determined, but I'm very curious. I don't know about you about the success or not of these vehicles. And I also wonder if they will get allocations from multiple asset classes. I mean, I could definitely see an LP allocating out of an infra bucket and real estate bucket, maybe even a PE bucket if there's a lot of development there. I don't know. How do you see this? I think the vehicles that are being touted for that thematic are at such, I'd say, nascent stages and of large size that I don't think we've seen necessarily movement in 2025 on those. But yeah, it'll be interesting to see, as you say, how those are received by LPs and what they continue to consider infrastructure or otherwise. But I think what is interesting looking at what was closed in 2024 compared to 2023, and this just may be year by year dynamics, but 2023, we had a substantial amount raised by debt funds and as alluded to before, a substantial amount raised by energy transition funds. Whereas this year, most of the largest funds were more generalist in their strategies, whether that was differentiated by geography or not, they were all more generalist. I think the geographic point is one worth spending some time on. I expect this will also have ups and downs in different years. But actually, one highlight of 2024 that we shouldn't ignore is the amount of Asia focused funds that we had in the top 10 funds closed. And obviously, I'm thinking about KKR's second Asia vehicle. That's actually the second largest fund that closed last year. But then we also have Stone Peak's debut Asia fund. That was the fifth largest fund closed last year. And then we had, okay, this is a bit different. We had GIP's second Australia fund, that was the ninth. And then also actually, just not just Asia, but also taking in Latin America, we also had GIP's emerging markets fund. So that's pretty much half of the top 10, you know, with regional vehicles and a strong Asia flavor, if you want to call it that. That's not something, you know, we would have had in previous years, I think. Yeah. Although a few of those funds were a long time in the making, let's say. So we may not see this dynamic reappear for a little bit. Yeah. Though I would say Asia funds are here to stay. It may, you know, be something that pops up every couple of years, but I think these franchises from KKR, Stone Peak, Macquarie, you know, I think they're going to keep getting larger. That's my sense. Aside from geography, the other thing that I found interesting was in strategies. And I think the biggest winner, quote unquote, was the value add space. It really jumped significantly from 13% in 2023 to 34% in 2024. I don't know what you think, but given how the asset class is evolving, probably we can expect value add to kind of be in this predominant position. Yeah, I think this is a point of debate, really. We've heard voices saying that it would make sense in this climate for value add funds to be the predominant ones. And actually that happened last year. Other people keep beating the core drumbeat and saying there's still benefits to it. But I think what's really interesting, and I think that comes across in our presentation is an okay, maybe we shouldn't do this, but if you lump together core and core plus as being on the lower side of the risk spectrum generally, and then value add opportunistic on the higher end, then you end up with a pretty even split. So meaning LPs last year ended up getting exposure across the risk spectrum. No doubt value add is the most popular strategy. Yeah, I would just caveat this with these figures are for closed end funds and you have large open and core funds like Brookbill and KKR, which last year exhibited a return to fundraising that they'd not seen in a good couple of years. So there is good progress on the core side that may not be showing up in these closed end fund figures. Yeah, that's a very fair point. The Blackstone doing a bit of balancing on the higher end of the risk spectrum with its open ended one. Okay, I think we can wrap up by saying that 2025 is going to be better, which is the non prediction of the year. Well, what else caught your eye? What else? What kind of note do you want to end on? What's going through your minds? One thing that really struck me, this seemed very contradictory. So on the one hand, you had a proportion of oversubscribed fund closes increasing, but also the portion of undersubscribed funds increasing. So I'm not sure what that means, unless it's an indication of consolidation where bigger managers are managing to close their funds oversubscribed. I don't know. I would just build on that and say that if you look at the funds which were undersubscribed in 2022, that was 29% of funds. If you look at that for 2023, that was 38% of the funds and for 2024, the funds which were undersubscribed was 43% of funds. So I would say my bold prediction for 2025 is that we will see at least half of funds closed, which are undersubscribed. That's a fair bet. We shouldn't forget that 2021 and 2022, it doesn't need repeating, but I'll just say it, it was a bit mad. I mean, we even did articles about how, you know, the percentage of oversubscription in that time period was a little bit off the charts and targets almost became like soft targets so that it would be nice if that were to continue. But I think that was always going to be a moment in time to a certain extent. Could there be an upside to slower fundraising in the sense that, you know, we've heard in the past about lots of dry powder being available and not having the opportunity to be deployed or having enough good opportunities to deploy capital. So maybe a more subdued fundraising environment could be a good thing in that sense, in terms of ability and ease and investing that capital. Yeah, I think that's a pretty strong point. I think we could and maybe should actually do an entire podcast on that subject because we have a lot to talk about there. But I also think it's a great note to end on. So, Calliope, Zach, thanks very much for your insights and I will see you soon. That, again, was Infrastructure Investor Deputy Editor Calliope Gorntis and America's Editor Zach Bantley.

### The energy transition’s next era
**Publication Date:** 2025-01-09 08:08:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2602

**Full Transcript:**
If the last few years have taught us anything, it's to be humble when predicting what comes next for our economies, our elections, our geopolitical stability, even our culture. Our energy industry is no exception. The title of the 2024 S&P Global Commodity Insights report on energy and climate scenarios is A New Pragmatism. It admits that any definitive view of the future of this industry should be taken with a grain of salt. Greenhouse gases continue to rise and fossil fuel demand is back to pre-COVID levels. However, the popularity of electric vehicles and innovation around renewable energy and capacity point to some promising developments. But the S&P report decided to focus on, as they put it, the practical steps necessary to translate ambitious policies and strategies into reality. And today we hope to offer an equally grounded view of that future. Welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. I'm Rob Kotecki, and in this episode, sponsored by Quinnbrook Infrastructure Partners and Nuveen, we'll be discussing the state of distributed energy, which means any electricity generation system that incorporates multiple small scale devices rather than a centralized power plant and distribution network. We'll also discuss behind the meter power generation, which refers to generation and storage systems connected to a distribution system on the customer side of the meter, such as onsite solar or EV charging stations. This of course brings up questions around battery and storage, and all these issues have a regulatory element that a second Trump administration will shape. To discuss these issues, we're sitting down with two veteran investors in the energy and renewable space, Don Dimitrovich, the Senior Managing Director and Portfolio Manager for Energy Infrastructure Credit at Nuveen, and David Skesbrook, the co-founder and managing partner of Quinnbrook Infrastructure Partners. Let's start with the state of distributed energy and behind the meter systems, corner of the market that's evolving with cheaper solar panels, but still battling for sufficient grid connections. Here's Don with his take. On the issue in terms of behind the meter solutions, clearly this is at the forefront of a lot of the discussions around the convergence of power generation in data centers. And you know, this is an evolving landscape and we just have to look to the FERC decision that was made in early November, wherein we saw that Talon had requested FERC approval to ostensibly shift one of its nuclear facilities to provide power to an Amazon data center. FERC stands for the Federal Energy Regulation Commission. And the FERC denied the request, partially on the basis that there was a view that that shifting of power generation capacity to support a data center was coming at the expense of grid stabilization and stability. And I think you take a step back here and data centers are, as we know, a huge consumer of power. And as a result, you're starting to see the tension between the need for grid stabilization, grid support from various power capacity generation facilities, and this demand by data centers. So one solution is for those data centers to co-locate power generation units directly on site that are discrete and separate from the grid to address this tension. I think you're going to see more and more of those types of commercial agreements. One example already hit the headlines a short time ago. We saw it with Microsoft making an announcement of reaching a commercial agreement with Constellation Energy to bring back one of the Three Mile Island units. And of course, that's carbon-free nuclear power generation. And I think you're going to see this trend play out more and more because there will be this competing tension. If data centers continue to really consume and demand a significant amount of power from the grid, that's going to create issues for the broader grid infrastructure. And it has both political and capital investment consequences. David has his own story from the trenches on the intersection of demands here. I can give you an example from a project that we did recently or doing in Maryland, where the rules historically have conspired against the proliferation of distributed solutions because many of the utilities and co-ops actually don't want that to happen. And so the rules are written in such a way to actually restrict or prevent a customer hosting distributed solution behind the meter because it reduced the amount of megawatts they were able to sell from their existing utility fleet or from their grid transmission lines. And that was the case, let's say, in Maryland until recently, where in order to build a data center there, the backup generation had to go through the entire PUC generation approval as if it was a new power station in the grid. But that's not where the story ended. We had to work for months with the governor to get the rule changed to be a little bit more pragmatic to enable what will become probably one of the largest data center campuses in America, right across the river from Virginia, which is currently very congested. But you're going to have something like 800 megawatts of backup generation that's sitting there on standby that can now be constructed. So if we can work to a rulemaking that enables backup generation solutions like that, which are by their nature distributed, to also be able to participate in the capacity solution for the grid, that's a win-win. It's a better result for the data center operators. It's a better result for the local grid stability, but the rules really have to evolve to let that happen. And Don points out that there may be a compelling rationale for some of that regulatory reform. For the last two decades, certainly in the U.S., power has largely grown at a pretty muted level. As we look forward here, you're going to see power demand growth with a significant step up. And so there's going to be a focus around power capacity, and we saw it with the latest PJM capacity market auction. PJM is a competitive wholesale electricity market for 13 states, including D.C. I think you're going to have a renewed focus on what are those sources of power generation, how are they being developed, the capital investment opportunity around that. And so distributed generation can serve as a solution to some of that in the context of grid stability and the need for incremental power generation and load growth. So this notion that you can have behind the meter solutions that, one, allow power demand consumers to not really put stresses onto the grid is one part of it, two, where you do have essentially backup power capacity that can then be provided to the grid in times of peak demand, that's an added benefit. I think we're going to see an evolution in the way people think about that capacity resource. If capacity is a core issue, it's only natural to look into the potential of microgrids, which are self-sufficient energy systems that act as a single controllable entity. Can they be scaled up to address the increasing need? Here's David. You're never going to get the theoretical proliferation that you think you're going to get. If you look at the energy economists' forecast for microgrid growth, just like a lot of others, in a sort of theoretical sense, it ought to happen, right? Because the economic drivers are being behind the meter. In some markets, not all, because there isn't a uniform way to price access to the grid, even if you need it 1% of the year, for example, and you want to generate behind the meter. So there is a patchwork of regulation, some of it which is helpful and some of which is actually prohibitive. But putting that aside, the issue that you've got is really scale and the development cost, right? The cost to develop a microgrid project, in some cases, the number of stakeholders that you have to corral to get everybody on board with it, then you've usually got to navigate, you know, planning rules and development permits in counties which have never done it before and don't really know how to assess it. And time kills you in development, right? So the longer it takes you to navigate these things, the economies of scale usually kill you in the end. But again, the actual story is more complicated than bleak, since microgrids have bloomed in certain places. It's only really proliferated in those states which have created very clear and strong incentives to do it, because you get a booster in your tax credits or whatever it might be. But just navigating the development process is not easy. So it's like the more micro, the tougher it is to do. I think you'll see more, you know, larger scale industrial campuses host on-site solutions that just need a little bit of extra scale to make sense. However, David identifies another wrinkle here, one that has to do with the new occupant of the White House. I think if you see, you know, the cost of equipment, which we've already seen increase, I mean, it's one of the more inflationary sectors of the economy right now, as Don was saying, the cost of transformers, switch gear, you know, they can't make this stuff fast enough. So no one's getting a discount. So the cost of everything is increasing. If we layer on another level of tariffs for that, you know, then it becomes, you start to erode that economic benefit of being behind the meter in the first place. You know, I don't want to be a downer on it, but we just can't really get excited about that proposition. And maybe you're talking to the wrong person. We've just sold out a distributed energy business in Australia. We did very well out of it. I don't think we'd go in and do it again because of that scale question. But David's not alone. Here's Don. Yeah, I would agree with David. I think there are clearly situations where behind the meter distributed generation makes a lot of sense, especially as we've talked about in terms of the data center space. There's an obvious synergy there. I think in other areas, I mean, we're active investors in community scale solar. We think that's an area that is economic. You have to deploy it at scale. You've got to have the right development team to do it, the right approach. It's obviously location specific, state and region specific. So it takes a certain sophistication and ability by the developer to really execute. If they do it well, it can be an attractive risk adjusted return, both I think for an equity and frankly from a credit perspective. But I think the notion that behind the meter and micro grids in particular, that that's sort of a full stop solution, I think is probably a little too optimistic. Capacity is a big question going forward, but so is storage, which is crucial to supply for the grid and any distributed energy solution. David weighs in on the state of storage. It's a big topic, this one. I mean, we were early into storage, probably 2015. So we've been in it probably nearly nine years now. And the market's just starting to realize that energy storage is not a plug and play technology at all. And there is a significant disparity, not just in the use cases and therefore the investment business models for storage, but also a significant difference in the performance of the battery storage, depending on what manufacturer and the equipment that you've chosen. And that's certainly not the case in most other technologies, whether they be gas turbines or solar modules or wind turbines. But what does this mean for his actual approach to the market? There are at least six, probably eight different ways to play storage in various markets, depending on duration and the regulatory incentive that is created in a particular market, whether it's ERCOT or California. As an infrastructure fund, we distinguish between what we call a hedge fund battery and an infrastructure battery. And a hedge fund battery is a merchant battery, which means it's actually intended to optimize the arbitrage in price and duration differentials in deregulated power markets in a given day. So ERCOT being probably the prime example in the United States. Whilst we do have some of that, it's pretty constrained. It's not really up the middle of the fairway for our mandate. ERCOT is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state's grid. But David's approach is surprisingly high tech, even for renewables. The way we've decided to play the arbitrage battery is really through our artificial intelligence optimization platform called Habitat Energy. And this is a service model that uses machine learning and optimization of dispatch and charging of batteries. And that is actually, we think you're going to have to have an optimizer, an algorithm that's optimizing your merchant battery in real time in modern power markets. We're seeing that right now where optimized batteries are generating anywhere between 15 and 25 percent more revenue, pound for pound, compared to batteries which are human, you know, managed by human traders. But that's hardly his only approach to storage plays. Here's an example of a hybrid where solar or wind is coupled with battery storage. We've just commissioned the largest coupled system in the United States in Nevada called Gemini, which is using excess solar during the day to charge a huge battery, which then when the sun goes down, it's releasing that power in the early evening, which is when the most expensive energy is going to be, we think in the shoulder period in the early evening peak. Now that is a great example of time shifting, but the combination of the solar and the battery from an investment perspective is underwritten for 25 years in a contract that we have with Envy Energy. That's what we call an infrastructure battery because we're able to really optimize the solar and the battery, but get a fixed revenue stream from the utility partner because we're not trying to arbitrage price intervals during the day. The second piece is tolling arrangements. So we've just closed out the largest battery in Australia here, about a $1.4 billion installation, which is underwritten by local utility partners for 15 years. But we give them basically the toggles. We own and operate the battery complex. And he's bullish on how battery tech will evolve in the near term. We uniquely have access to technology roadmaps through to 2030 for some of the world's leading manufacturers. And I can tell you what we see is nothing short of extraordinary. And I think it would be imprudent to assume that you're not going to see very, very significant leaps in the capacity and the ability and the performance envelope of lithium batteries over the next five to six years. The insights we have inform our investment decisions. And one of the reasons why we like contracted revenues in the battery storage space is I think the technological obsolescence risk that we see in batteries is unprecedented. Like I've been in this business 35 years, I never had to worry about waking up one morning and GE having a gas turbine that was 30% more efficient than the Siemens one. But that is genuinely what you're seeing at the moment in battery storage. And that's probably one of the biggest risks as an investor you need to be aware of if you're doing a merchant battery proposition. So it's a shifting landscape. It's terribly exciting. I think battery storage is single handedly going to shift power markets more than any other technology. But there's a number of different ways to play it and they each have different risk return propositions. And Dan is just as bullish on batteries. I've been investing in the renewable space for close to a quarter of a century. As I look at the developments back in the 2000s, we really saw the proliferation of onshore wind. And then over the last, call it decade, 15 years, we've seen solar really gain prominence in different markets. The key aspect to energy storage is it sort of solves the puzzle, if you will, in terms of intermittency as renewables increasingly play a large part of the grid resource in market share. You need to couple that intermittent solar and wind capacity with energy storage to be able to take that excess capacity during the day when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing and then dispatch it when it's required. However, Don, like David, pursues multiple angles to battery storage plays. I think David's point in terms of the different ways you can effectively model the revenues, whether it's through a tolling arrangement or a hedge fund model where they're really trying to optimize the pricing arbitrage. From a credit perspective, we try to provide flexible capital solutions where typically the offtake will have some component of a tolling arrangement, giving us a certain amount of cash flow visibility, and then allowing the project equity owner to participate in the market arbitrage as well. Allows us to have some cash flow protection and yet make those projects economic. I think there is clearly over this next decade, energy storage is going to be a key, key part of the solution set. What I think is interesting as well is in contrast to some other areas of the supply chain, we've actually seen costs come down over the last, call it six months in terms of the price of the batteries. We've also invested in projects like David described, where it's coupled with a solar project to provide that two hour, four hour duration to make the project holistically more economic and viable. He also noted that tariffs may play a role in those prices, but what do firms like Nuveen and Quinnbrook expect from the Trump administration with regard to the energy industry as a whole? Well, it is the number one conversation. It's occupying a lot of bandwidth right now. Not just at our shop, but everywhere. I think the most significant elements to it from our point of view are really the impact it has on both incentivization of domestic manufacturing of the equipment that we need, particularly solar and battery storage, and then how supply chains are going to shift. The impact of tariffs on the cost of equipment imported into America, I don't see it as a wholesale rewrite. We have been under a Trump administration previously. In fact, we were able to progress and start construction on the largest solar and battery project in US history with the help of some of the Trump regulations they introduced around government efficiency, ironically. So this to us isn't a fundamental rewrite. I'd say we can anticipate the areas where there will be shifts. I think it'll move to an all of the above energy policy. They've already signaled that. We will have certainly more incentivization of fossil fuel generation, particularly gas. It won't be anti-renewables in our view. But this doesn't mean he expects things won't change at all. I think where you'll find the impacts will be felt mostly in active trade and tariff discrimination around the sourcing of equipment and the impact of what will certainly be inflationary cost increases on imported equipment, particularly from China. That's where we are very much focused on that outcome, which will certainly in our minds create a two-tiered market of those that can access equipment, particularly solar and batteries that qualify for domestic content. However, that is going to be redefined and imported equipment is going to be subject to quite punitive tariffs. Now they have already been introduced by the Biden administration, significant tariff increases from next year on particularly Chinese sourced equipment. Question is how much further does the Trump administration go? You know, they've signaled more punitive impacts that will simply widen the spread between the procurement costs of those that can access in a mitigated way and those that can't. Overall, though, I think, you know, sentiment will dampen, but investment really won't. Don agrees, but stresses the broader trends in the industry as well when he thinks about this new era. The reality is an all energy solution, I think, is frankly mandatory. We're in a period where for reasons with generative data, artificial intelligence, there's a need for significant capital investment to satisfy power demand. As we look forward here, there are secular trends, whether it's a combination of the generative data, power demand, some of the factors that David cited just in terms of the tariff environment, the geopolitical environment. There's clearly a focus on the need to ensure energy security, and that means being able to procure a lot of the equipment for the infrastructure supply chain domestically. And so that onshoring of the supply chain is a huge driver of energy and power demand. I mean, just to level set, there's a semiconductor facility that is planned for here upstate in New York, which once it's reaching its full capacity, will consume as much power as the states of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. So the fundamental drivers on power demand and energy demand growth are there. And the question is, how do we effectively supply that demand? And renewables are certainly a part of the solution. That said, Don doesn't ignore what a new administration means, which includes a substantial role for natural gas in that overall solution. And in many ways, it's complementary, because as we've seen over the past year or two years, some of the renewable projects here in North America have been delayed just as a result of some of the permitting issues. It's taking longer to get projects permitted. We have interconnection issues, and then we have supply chain issues. I mean, there's still a delay on transformers, inverters, where we're seeing it takes five to seven years from really inception to see these renewable projects come online. And so natural gas power generation or thermal power generation can be part of the solution in the short to medium term. I think some of the loan programs and incentives under the Department of Energy loan program will probably get eliminated or certainly reduced. Now, as a credit investor, we may be able to provide some of the credit solutions that would have been previously under a Biden administration provided by the DOE loan program. So I think it's a multifaceted situation. It's early days to really see how some of this plays out once the Trump administration comes into power. But the reality is, given the fundamental drivers on power demand growth and energy demand growth, certainly the types of investments we're talking about as it relates to renewables, the importance of energy storage, continue to be as relevant as ever. The need for energy is an issue that will have to be solved, and renewables almost by necessity are part of that mix, regardless of who's in charge. We learned that distributed energy and microgrids will be hard to scale at the moment, but battery tech might be improving faster than anyone expects. The second Trump administration is bound to be a mixed bag with tariffs potentially making equipment and materials harder to source and more expensive, along with the upsides around a willingness to back any solution to our energy needs. That all of the above approach naturally includes renewables, even if the exact nature of that market in the coming years will be hard to predict.

### Brookfield: ‘We can play in scale, even on day one’
**Publication Date:** 2025-01-06 08:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2603

**Full Transcript:**
Hi, I'm Bruno Alves and welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. In today's episode, our first of the year, I sit down with Hadley Peer-Marshall, Chief Financial Officer of Brookfield Asset Management and Co-Head of Brookfield's Infrastructure Debt and Structure Solutions business. Brookfield has long been one of the asset class's premier fund managers, but recently it's cornered the large cap space in a way that is almost peerless. Brookfield Infrastructure Fund 5, its fifth flagship, is now the asset class's biggest closed-end equity fund, having closed on $28 billion last December. Its third debt fund closed on $6 billion in November 2023 and is the largest pure-play infrastructure debt fund in market. Its global transition fund, one of the first dedicated energy transition strategies, closed in 2022 on $15 billion. You can see where we're going with this. Capital then is an integral part of the Brookfield proposition and one of the key topics in my discussion with Hadley, which covers Brookfield's preconditions to launch new strategies, the firm's appetite for large-scale corporate partnerships with the likes of Microsoft and Intel, as well as the opportunity in the ever-growing private infrastructure debt market. Hi Hadley, welcome to the podcast. Thank you, Bruno. Excited to be here. I wanted to start off by talking about AI infrastructure. Recently, I think at a recent earnings call, Brookfield Asset Management President Connor Taskey mentioned that AI infrastructure is kind of at the top of your list when it comes to thinking and potentially new products. And so I just want to get the Brookfield perspective on AI infrastructure. What's your thinking around this? How would you fit it into your strategies or how would you think about something new? Just give me a little bit the Brookfield take on this sector. Well, it's a very popular theme and it actually bodes very well with Brookfield because of our expertise in data infrastructure and in particular data centers. And then of course, our renewable franchise. We have got a huge, enormous opportunity set across both of those areas. And when you think about where Brookfield has really been focusing, it's around our three D's. So de-globalization, digitalization, decarbonization, and that's hitting on two of the three right there. And so we have a lot of expertise that we've been using within our various strategies, and we will continue to do that. And then we, of course, are always assessing new opportunities out there for us. I mean, we think about the world with either building or buying when we are at the BAM level, the Brookfield Asset Management perspective. And here's one area that we've got a lot of expertise. And so, as an example, BGHF, we built that business over the years and then launched a separate strategy, and now we're on our second vintage. So you can see that the themes there play out further. And AI infrastructure has been a very topical theme across the market and one that we continue to assess. It's really something that everybody is talking about these days. And so when you think about it, you know, is there a little bit of, you know, maybe of concern that the field is getting very crowded very quickly? How do you view that part of it? Because almost everybody seems to be wanting to go into it. You know, generally, when we're thinking about new strategies, I mean, there's a handful of criteria that we're using. I mean, one is obviously investor demand, two is our capabilities and value add. And generally, in many instances, BGHF is a good example that, you know, we can play in scale even day one. I mean, when we launched our first fund, we raised more capital than we anticipated. I mean, we launched at $7 billion and more than doubled that. And so from that standpoint, you know, we've been able to be very competitive across our flagship strategies from that standpoint. So that is one competitive advantage to Brookfield and how we do compete in the market space. You've mentioned your global transition fund series, and you've been a first mover on renewables. You've also, I think, been a first mover on the energy transition with the launch of the GTF series. I think you've mentioned just now a few of the preconditions that need to happen for you to go into a new strategy or even think about it. But I'd want to explore that just a little bit more. So what needs to happen? You know, when you look across the strategies you've already launched, what needed to happen for Brookfield to decide to go into a certain theme or a certain sector? You know, I think a good example of that is our infrastructure debt franchise. We launched that about nine, almost 10 years ago, and we spent a lot of time thinking about the marketplace. I mean, we are obviously a huge issuer of debt. So we could see with a very clear lens what was happening in the capital markets. And after the credit crisis, you saw a pullback in capital from the various financing institutions and it left a hole. And so that was the development of what we thought of more high-yield mezzanine debt for infrastructure. And that was a similar case to real estate debt, which we had launched almost 20 years ago, actually more than 20 years ago. So there are themes that we're watching in the market and waiting for the right time to then play forward. You know, being a large investor and owner and operator of infrastructure, renewable and transition gave us a strong advantage to launch that infrastructure debt strategy and then expand from there. So that's a good example of how we think about when to enter the marketplace and develop new strategies. One of the things that, and this actually came up recently, and I think it was, again, it was Conor that mentioned, but I think one of the, let's call it issues with having such a plethora of strategies at such a large menu is that sometimes you, you know, you can have multiple strategies in the market at the same time. And then it was in this context, I believe that Conor mentioned something along the lines of, you know, experiencing some, some slower fundraising for GTF2 on the back of also having your catalytic transition fund, which for listeners, it's Brookfield's Emerging Markets Dedicated Energy Transition Fund, a blended finance vehicle. And you started referred to this as a high class problem. Do you find that one of the advantages is that, you know, we know that there's a trend among LPs that they want to basically stick to the same managers, even sometimes shrink the pool of managers. And so in that sense, while you, you know, you may encounter this high class problem, you may even get a smaller check for one of your vehicles, but then perhaps you get a larger one for whatever else you have on. But do you feel you are benefiting from having this menu and just keeping your clients on board as it were, instead of them straying elsewhere? That has been a big theme in the current and even the past year fundraising environment. You know, 2023 has been viewed as a more difficult fundraising environment, but we didn't see the impact of that because of our ability to provide various options for our investors. And so to your point, that consolidation in the, in managers has really benefited us from that standpoint. And it continues to allow us to think about things also on the buy side. So meaning that, you know, we can partner, Oak Tree was one of our big examples of that, but Castle Lake more recently in the asset-backed finance space. You've always been keen on corporate partnerships and corporate infrastructure, and obviously you've recently struck a landmark partnership with Microsoft to contract 10.5 gigawatts or around 30% of Brookfield's renewable capacity growth from 2026 to 2030. Tell us a little bit, how will this work in practice, given that you have multiple funds chipping in, multiple geographies involved, how is this going to work nuts and bolts way? Well, actually, Bruno, I mean, you kind of just outlined why Microsoft saw us as a partner of choice, because we have all these different technologies and capabilities behind that. And also from a geographic perspective, so that we can deliver on this partnership that we have with Microsoft. And so, you know, we continue to work with them closely. One of the benefits is of course, showing them our pipeline and where we have a lot of opportunity set, and then trying to mirror that up. Because obviously what they're doing on the other side is for their data center capacity. And so working very closely with them to create alignment and partnership in order to fulfill what they're trying to do is the key component. And of course, doing it in a decarbonized way. And do you, for example, how do you ensure, you know, things like certainty of execution? Are there kind of certain milestones built into this? Because again, it's a multi-year span. How do you ensure alignment of interests? How do those things work? Well, one of the key benefits is our development pipeline and the size of that development pipeline. So this is again, going back to an earlier point you and I were discussing around our ability to deliver in size. The second part is of course, and what Microsoft cares very much, and you've pointed out, is that certainty of being able to deliver. And that's where our reputation plays forward in a meaningful way, so that they can have the confidence that we can deliver what they need in size. And then of course, with that certainty and within a certain period of time, because that's critical to their build-out as well. Do you see potential for other large-scale corporate tie-ups? Absolutely. I mean, this is just a very public example of that. There may be examples where we have partnered with the corporate space and continue. Intel's another great example of that and the semiconductor space and our partnership with them. So we will continue to expand that corporate partnership. The ability for Brookfield to bring what we were earlier talking about, that certainty, that scale of capital and the flexibility and solution provider has really continued to open that door to these types of conversations. So we are excited to continue to post you on those. And you mentioned Intel and that's, I think, a good example of one issue that people always think about when we're talking about corporate infrastructure versus, let's say, more traditional government infrastructure where, you know, if you're in the OECD, of course, governments have a certain, let's say, a certain rating or credit rating or whatnot. And for example, even with large corporates and we're seeing with Intel that now there's a lot of talk about their future, et cetera. How do you manage a little bit that potential counterparty uncertainty? Or do you view it as, you know, the same as government counterparty uncertainty, really? Well, you know, when you think about the various risks in these investments, obviously, counterparty is one that's always a consideration and a meaningful consideration. But where we are partnering, we're partnering with the top tiers. And so you have less risk attached to that. And then we look through the structures and things like that to give us further protection, depending on, you know, for equity debt and how the structure plays out. So it is a meaningful consideration. And, you know, if you take a step back and just think, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago when you were reporting in this space, I mean, we were talking about completely different asset classes and counterparties. And so the asset class continues to expand and grow. And it obviously gives you a lot more to cover in the space and many more opportunities for us to invest in. No, you're absolutely right there. And one thing I, you know, and the team have discussed internally when we look at what's happening in the AI infrastructure and data center space is really the scale of the opportunity. I mean, think back 10 years ago, as you were referring, and, you know, usually you would need some kind of government to engineer the multi-trillion dollar type pipeline that you're now seeing from the corporate side with, you know, with AI infrastructure and with data centers. That to us feels like, you know, a real change. I don't know if how you see it and how Brookfield, you know, sees it, but it does feel like the corporate sector now has, you know, a meaningful pipeline in a way that wasn't always the case. Yeah. And they're pushing agendas. And, you know, when you think about some of the numbers, you know, the latest one we've seen is 200 trillion of infrastructure capital is needed, including renewables in transition over the next few decades. I mean, that is a huge number. And who knows exactly what the right number is, but it's a huge number. I mean, that is a number that is very difficult to even get your arms around it. And so the opportunity set is enormous. And luckily, the investor demand is there as well. So that should really be able to push the buildout that needs to occur over the next few decades. Hallie, I wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk about infrastructure debt. Obviously, it's one of your roles to manage those strategies at Brookfield or to co-manage it. And I know you've raised one of the largest pure play closed-ended infrastructure debt strategies in the market, your third debt fund. I hear you're about to raise a fourth. We hear a lot about the benefits of having scale on the equity side. Maybe you could tell us a little bit how that works, having that kind of scale on the debt side and what the benefits are. Well, it's really matching up nicely with what we're seeing on the equity side. To your point, you know, the asset class continues to grow, the deal size continues to grow. And so to be able to speak to a broader part of the pipeline is very beneficial to find some very attractive opportunities out there. So, you know, our bite size continues to be small and now it allows us to continue to grow that range up to a point where we can be quite valuable to all different types of players in the infrastructure space, small and large. Where are you, you know, are you playing everywhere in terms of sectors or geographies? Are you focusing on more themes as a lender or certain places? How is that working for you? It is a strategy that we focus on globally with a lot of the core markets being North America and Europe, but a strong push into Asia Pacific, where we've seen the most opportunities more recently, especially last year was in North America, given the market disruption we saw, whether it was, you know, the leveraged finance market coming and going, the banks retrenching, the regional banks having issues, things like that played forward and create a lot of opportunity in North America. But generally we see most of the deals in Europe and North America. And then from a sector perspective, I guess, Bruno, you asked about that too, and it's been very much driven on the themes that we were just discussing, the digitalization and the decarbonization. So from that standpoint, since we started the strategy almost 10 years ago, the largest pool of opportunities we've seen is in the renewable space. And that's been consistent throughout. It just shows you the amount of capital going in that asset class. And you've seen the buildup over time for data infrastructure. And Hadley, we were just talking, and you were rightly saying that, you know, compared to 10 years ago, this asset class looks completely different. And that's totally true. And as the asset class has been expanding, and if you think about it just as a lender, is your job now harder in that maybe you are getting pitched assets that don't have the requisite infrastructure characteristics, or how is that working out? What we do have to spend a lot of time thinking about, does it fit the definition of infrastructure? And we continue to stay very disciplined around that definition. So it's at the core of what we all think of long-term predictable cash flows, essentiality, high barriers, capital intensive. And so that has to be at the forefront whenever we look at an opportunity. And probably the number one reason we're saying no to deals is because it doesn't fit into that bucket. Now, there may be other places within Brookfield that we can invest in that opportunity, but for it to go into our infrastructure, renewable and transition strategies, it's got to fit into that mandate. And the asset class growing has allowed us to grow on the backs of that, but still staying quite disciplined to them. And in that sense, we've been through a very obvious interest rate spike compared to where we were in the last decade. We are now perhaps entering a period of interest rates moderating and lowering a bit in most of the key markets. So let me ask you, the first question is, is infrastructure debt still as attractive a proposition as it was, I don't know, maybe a year ago? It is. And, you know, the beauty of where we are today relative to 10 years ago is now we have a track record for the asset class. Infrastructure debt is a newer asset class. It's even newer than infrastructure equity. And so that track record, I think, is quite valuable to really understand what the asset class can bring to our investors. So we've invested in high interest rates, medium interest rates, low interest rates, et cetera. And the beneficial is, of course, what you're getting relative to what is available in the broader market, especially from a fixed income perspective. And it is quite attractive. Plus, remember, the asset class is well known, especially if you stay disciplined to the definition of infrastructure, for having low default rates and high recovery rates. So that makes it even more attractive for investors when they're thinking about diversification in their portfolio. Would you say we're still in sort of a lender's market this day and that the lender is in a strong position to, you know, to dictate terms also on pricing? Are we still at that stage of the cycle? I think we're in a position where, especially after 2023, where there is decent liquidity in the market. We've got the banks who are always and will continue to be major players in the asset class and private credit playing a larger piece of that as well. So that's allowed for more liquidity to be in the space. But of course, the asset class continues to grow at really strong growth rates. So that puts us probably in a very even place because the amount of capital needed versus the amount of opportunity set out there will flow. We feel like we're in a position where we can provide very customized, flexible solutions that really can provide the type of capital that the infrastructure owners are looking for as well as grow with them, right? Because even portfolios are growing over time, and that's quite important when you're looking at a partnership from that perspective. And in terms of, you know, I think this was one of the themes of, let's say, the last few years. There was a lot of discussion about the relative attractiveness of infrastructure debt in relation to infrastructure equity, obviously certain types of infrastructure that would be more competitive with equity. But many people would say from a risk adjusted return perspective, you would be better off in infrastructure debt. How does that bit look nowadays? So, you know, the attractiveness of debt versus equity on the risk adjusted basis? Well, you know, I would if you take a step back and think about it, you know, the attractiveness is really just around what you're looking for from a portfolio diversification perspective. Because whether you're in equity or debt, you're going to find a very attractive risk adjusted return. The debt side of the equation is one where it's just still building up as an asset class. And you're always thinking about it relative to the broader fixed income market. So the benchmarking is usually different from that perspective. And here's where you're going to pick up a premium because of the illiquidity, the structuring, the liquidity in the market relative to the broader corporate fixed income market, things like that. So that does make it quite attractive. And then, of course, you add in, layer in the infrastructure element to which has that positive benefit around the defaults. That makes it an overall very attractive asset class for investors. And that's why it's been growing as an asset class. I think my last question on debt that I wanted to ask you is really, and especially because in your case, you are doing fundraising at scale and have done so. So where are people allocating from these days? Are you, are LPs taking it out of their fixed income bucket? Is it coming from their alternatives bucket, a mixture? What are you seeing in this respect? All over. It's quite interesting because when you go into a meeting, you're not quite sure which bucket they may be thinking about. The fixed income bucket makes a lot of sense because if you look at a fixed income bucket on a regular basis, you're not getting exposure to the asset class in any meaningful way. And so this is a good diversification component to that. But of course, people will also think about it from even just a private credit. So just the private credit side of it. And then, of course, the alts in sometimes the infrastructure bucket. And so it does mean that it can fit different mechanisms depending on what you're looking for from the diversification. And is the educational piece these days, is it still very much front and center or you find when you walk into these meetings, you know, InfraDebt is, you know, much more established and it's in people's minds in a different way than a few years ago, maybe? Definitely. I mean, it's definitely improved in that regard. I mean, when we first started out, you know, we were having one-on-one sessions and some people would ask us, you know, is this muni debt you're talking about? And we'd have to explain exactly what we were referring to and get into the weeds a little bit more and even spend time on what infrastructure was. Because you have to think about if you're talking to someone who was investing out of the fixed income, they probably haven't looked at infrastructure before. And so they need to get better acquainted with the asset class itself and what the value is from the asset class more broadly. Hadley, I think that's a great note to end on.

### Is America’s energy transition safe in Trump’s hands?
**Publication Date:** 2024-12-12 11:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2604

**Full Transcript:**
The United States has always pitched itself as the land of opportunity, and that's certainly the case these days when it comes to infrastructure investment. The country's needs are immense, and rising to the infrastructure requirements of the digital age and a climate-secure future also has the potential to bring much-needed employment and economic stimulus. That was the Biden administration's thinking when it introduced federal initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. But U.S. voters have now handed the keys to the White House back to Donald Trump, and his past rhetoric on the IRA has not been glowing, to put it mildly. So in this episode, reported by Helen Luer and sponsored by Nuveen and Igneo Infrastructure Partners, we'll explore how the new political landscape could affect the asset class and discuss whether investors have good reason to be spooked. Joining us is John Ma, partner and co-head of Igneo Infrastructure Partners' North American Investment Team, and Don Dimitrovich, portfolio manager for Nuveen's Energy Infrastructure Credit business. Welcome to the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. Multi-regional funds aside, North America has traditionally been institutional capital's destination of choice. So it makes sense to start by looking at how important a supportive federal policy and regulatory climate under President Biden has been to sustaining that trend. Despite the overall lackluster global fundraising backdrop lately, here's Don Dimitrovich from Nuveen. The U.S. has been particularly attractive over the last several years, and one reason for that is the Inflation Reduction Act. There are a number of tax credits incentives that really attracted capital to the U.S. We're two years in, and if you look at 2023, there's over $100 billion of capital invested in clean energy technologies and projects here in the U.S., and so I think in terms of creating the right investment climate to attract foreign capital, from our perspective, the U.S. is clearly one of the most attractive markets. Igneo's John Ma agrees that the IRA has added to the allure of the United States for LPs. One of the real benefits also of it has been that it provided a long-term window and was supposed to provide a great deal of certainty. There's a 10-year plan for many of these credits that gave developers and investors a real window of visibility and hopefully certainty that you can invest in a project and build up capability, and it's not just stops and starts. But with a second Trump presidency looming, is that certainty now threatened? Trump's not exactly known to be the biggest advocate of the IRA. Here's Dimitrovich again. I think the change in the political landscape creates both uncertainty and opportunity, and I think we'll see how the Trump administration addresses the Inflation Reduction Act. I think the more interesting aspect is around Speaker Johnson's view that he's going to use a scalpel, or at least they're going to do perhaps a line-by-line assessment of different credits and incentives, and we'll have to see how that actually gets applied. I think the other issue I know we'll touch on is the Trump administration's focus on tariffs and what the implication is for that in terms of investment, because we've seen over the course of the two years with the Inflation Reduction Act coming into effect a renaissance in manufacturing in the U.S. I think the stat I've seen is there are 44 manufacturing projects here in the U.S. that have either been built or have expanded production for clean energy technologies, and another 114 manufacturing facilities that are in development, and you think about the local impact that provides in terms of jobs for those districts. I think both the Trump administration and, frankly, the Inflation Reduction Act is supportive of that jobs growth and having that capability domestically, and so we'll have to see how they balance that need with the view of putting on tariffs and some of the cost implications that presents for importing the raw materials to build that equipment here. Moss similarly believes that the IRA's economic benefits will make completely repealing it very unpalatable for Trump and the Republicans. I think when you look at it, what we've always maintained, I think most people do, is when you look at the benefit of the Inflation Reduction Act, follow the dollars, follow the jobs, and 85 or 90% of the economic benefit have gone to Republican states. When you look in the U.S. where a lot of the renewable resources and where there's been a lot of the build out and where a lot of the projects are, it's in a lot of the heartland of America, a lot of those states that on the map they mark as red, a lot of the manufacturing has gone to those types of states. So I think there's just a real political economic calculus that I think, in our view, makes wholesale repeal quite unlikely, and I've heard that same phrase of, let's take a scalpel to it, not a sledgehammer. A Republican-dominated Washington, D.C. is trying to extend corporate tax cuts. And so just from a budget scoring perspective, they're going to be looking for savings where they can. And I think that's where the scalpel comes out, to look for some things. But wholesale repeal, again, we think just given where the benefit is flowing today and for the foreseeable future, is quite unlikely. But it's something we're definitely watching. I think and I hope that also we will know soon, you know, markets, as I've said before, hate uncertainty. And I think there was some talk of, well, they're preparing a bunch of initiatives, bunch of executive orders for January 21st, you know, day one effectively. And I think we'll have a clearer picture by then, just from early moves in office, early appointments as to which direction this goes. So I'd agree. I don't think you're going to see a full repeal of the IRA. But I think the point, John, you just made in terms of an assessment, you can't just look at the Inflation Reduction Act onto itself. You have to consider it in the context of, you know, the tax cuts that the Trump administration implemented back in 2017 will lapse here in a year or so. And it's clear that a Trump administration is very supportive of implementing the corporate tax cuts and the other cuts that Trump has advocated for. And there are different assessments in terms of the total cost. I've heard numbers $4 trillion, $7 trillion to implement all of them. The reality is that's going to require savings in different areas. And we know we've got the Musk group that's going to focus on some of the cost cut initiatives, but they're going to look to the Inflation Reduction Act as a source of revenue to offset some of those cuts. I think it's clear that a Trump administration is also supportive of oil and gas production in the hydrocarbon economy. So I think as we look forward, there are areas that I think are probably more susceptible to cuts and, you know, some of the EV incentives may be at risk. I think more broadly speaking, as we think about energy and power, there's a question around the PTCs and the ITCs for renewables and energy storage. And frankly, I'm not sure where that ultimately comes out. If you look at history as a guide here, those have been approved by both Republican and Democrat administrations over the last two decades. There's obviously a huge amount of capital that's been invested in Republican states like Texas. They've been a huge beneficiary for both renewables and energy storage. So my suspicion is those will continue in some form, but I don't think it's absolutely clear. And the other areas where I think you'll see a Republican administration continue to be supportive is in some of the areas in terms of biofuels, where that's in jurisdictions that have been supportive. I think hydrogen in some areas where you've seen the chemicals industry support, support that may continue. But I think the one area that I do think will be at risk are the DOE loan programs, where if those dollars haven't been allocated, they're probably at risk. The DOE programs are from the Department of Energy, which offers loans to those who want to deploy, among other things, innovative clean energy and advanced transportation projects in the United States. Now, Ma circles back to a previous point to support the view that Trump's scalpel will likely only make superficial cuts to future infrastructure development. We've talked a bit about the Inflation Reduction Act. I also just want to provide as one example or anecdote to talk about the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act from 2021, which is also, that's probably more classic, you know, transportation, water and other sectors of the infrastructure economy. We've got an investment in a short line freight rail business in the U.S., was catching up with the management team recently. There was a big round of federal grants, these CRICI grants that go to the rail, the freight rail industry in the U.S. and Patriot, you know, was awarded one of those grants. For an important line, for an important project carrying especially chemicals and minerals in a region of the U.S., happens to be in the Speaker of the House's home district. You know, very deserving project. But just to give you a flavor of, you know, this is where the investment is going. And just to picture you've got Speaker Johnson's home district benefiting from that. And I think, again, to the extent if you see where the benefits are flowing, they're widespread around the U.S., which I think makes it harder for the legislative bodies to, on a wholesale basis, really try to cut back a lot. At greater risk are projects that have not yet reached the development stage and have no capital committed, Dmitrovich says. And this creates uncertainty for institutional investors and delays in allocating capital. I have a hard time seeing how projects and jobs that are being created from it, where the shovelers are already in the ground or the capital's already been allocated, that will somehow repeal that. And one of the benefits of some of the legislation was that certainty for a 10-year period. I think that obviously is in question now, and especially as they look for dollars to offset the tax cuts. I think it creates some uncertainty, and we're going to have to see how it unfolds. And clearly from a capital investment perspective, all of us are going to be focused on seeing how that plays out before we ultimately make the investment decision. So the immediate result is there may be delays in some of the capital investment decisions over the course of the next several months to a year until we see how it plays out. Moss says that clarity sooner rather than later from the new administration on its position regarding the IRA and other federal support for infrastructure is critical. Day one executive actions would be helpful, because ultimately over time as we started some of the discussion, the demand for capital into a lot of these sectors I think will continue. And markets, whether you see them reflected in PPA rates or something, they will adapt, I believe, over time. And so just kind of establishing certainty as soon as possible in the early days of 2025 will be the thing I would wish for the most. A lot of discussion in the industry recently has focused on if and how the incoming Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress might unwind existing infra-friendly policy instituted by Democrats. But what they could initiate on their own on the policy front may matter just as much. So what else is there that could put further impetus behind infrastructure development, attract more private investment, and provide much-needed economic stimulus in the future? In other words, what's on the policy wish list of our two guests? Here's Dmitrovich. I think having clarity around the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, and the manufacturing tax credits, areas that have an immediate impact on investments in renewables, investments in energy storage, investments in the infrastructure supply chain. Having clarity around what those credits look like is probably my single biggest wish. Because I think if you take a step back and listen to what Trump talked about during the election, it was affordability. I think his policy initiative is to try and reduce energy costs by 50% in a year. And I'm not going to comment on whether that's actually possible. But I think the notion of affordability, the notion of energy security, which is something he's talked about, we need to be able to make the investments in these areas to provide the energy and power that's needed to support the economy. Having clarity around those tax credits for an extended period where we can make an investment and see those projects come to fruition is critical. For Ma, his wish list includes initiatives that would streamline the U.S.'s complex and gridlocked energy transmission system. I think one of the things that has been talked about for years and I think we're hopeful about with a new administration in Washington, D.C., is some permitting reform, particularly for long-haul power transmission, electric transmission. The permitting environment, I think, in the U.S. is challenging. It's difficult. It's also one of these things where there's federal law and there's also state and local. It's just sort of a layer upon layer. It's one of the things that makes the market interesting here in the U.S., I think, because you do get a lot of fragmentation and variations from region to region. The permitting environment in California is quite different from a state like Texas, for example. But broadly, for interstate transmission, I think that's one where the federal government could streamline, try to streamline some things. It would really help the strength of the grid in the U.S. overall. It's not a wishlist item, but I do think that the U.S., given this multilayered federal, state, and local set of regulations, overall, it's frustrating, but it also makes it, in some ways, very resilient, the U.S. market overall. Because we're mid-market investors, but you just find all these variations. Certain things may not be so favorable in one region or one subsector or market in the U.S., but because of state-level incentives or state or regional dynamics, things are OK and they go on. He offers an example from Igneo's portfolio. One area that we've invested in, and I think will continue to be a theme, is more localized generation to get away from some of the constraints in the transmission system. So we've invested in a distributed generation company that provides additional generation kind of closer to demand, closer to the electrical load, and whether it's net metering or behind the meter type solutions, I think all of those will probably see a lot of continued growth and opportunity in those areas. Dimitrovich is in alignment on grid transmission in the United States, agreeing that it's a huge issue, but he's skeptical that a solution will be found anytime soon. The U.S. is, you know, just given the complexity of trying to expand the grid, because it is a federal, state, and local issue, it's made it particularly challenging. I think there's currently legislation that was proposed by Manchin and Barrasso, which was really a bipartisan initiative to try and address some of those issues. We'll see if it ultimately moves forward. I think a lot of the ideas there around trying to simplify some of the regulatory requirements to enable the expansion of the grid, I think it is obviously something that would be constructive, especially given, you know, what we just talked about, there's a need for incremental power and being able to generate the power and then let it get transported to the right regions would be additive. But I think there's just a lot of political inertia around this issue, and ultimately I'm skeptical that we're going to make as much progress as I think you and I would hope. For this reason, like Ma, he thinks more localized solutions are critical to look at. Expanding the meter solutions, distributed generation, is definitely one way we can offset some of the grid issues. So I think as an investment theme, that's an area that's of interest to us as well. I think other grid enabling technologies where we can improve the efficiency of the existing transmission lines is an area where it's actionable, it doesn't require building out new transmission lines, and so it's an area that we're also focused on. Dimitrovich highlights another issue, which is the length of time it takes for renewables projects to come into operation. We've talked a lot about the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act or using a scalpel to some of the programs that were part of that. I think the other side is the state environments and initiatives that states and potentially blue states may implement if the Inflation Reduction Act is repealed or certain parts are reduced or eliminated. You could certainly see states like California implement some other initiatives at the state level to support clean energy investments. I think the other point that you made about simplifying the regulatory process, giving clarity and timing certainty is obviously, from an investor perspective, desirable. We can speak to our direct experience having invested in the Synzia project, which is as a debt investment, we provided some loans to the project. It's a 3,500 megawatt wind project in New Mexico with a transmission line. It took 17 years for Pattern to ultimately get all the approvals for it, even though it was fast-tracked under the Obama administration back in 2008. That's a poster child of how challenging it is to ultimately get projects that have significant economic incentives to provide both clean energy, thousands of jobs in those regions, and yet it still took 17 years. So do our guests think now is the time for optimism or caution for institutional money looking for a home in American infrastructure? I would sum it up as a bit of uncertainty in the near term, hopeful for much more clarity really in just the next, call it 60 days or so, 60 to 90 days. Hopefully they'll shed much more light, maybe not fully on the direction of travel over the next four years. But today I'd like to try to be an optimist about it, which is why I come back to the strength of the US economy first and also the resilience. Look, the voters have spoken and we do have a complex system with a lot of checks and balances historically in the US, and it's a really diverse market when you get down to the local level around the US. I think if you're in the right pockets in the right areas in the US and all just that underlying secular growth and demand for improved infrastructure in many aspects of the economy overall, I remain optimistic that the outlook over the medium and long term should continue to be really strong. And John, I'll go one step further and say I'm incredibly optimistic, and here's the reason. When we look at the opportunity set, we know that a Trump administration will be supportive in areas of traditional energy. I would expect him to lift the ban on LNG exports. There'll be opportunities in conventional power. I think those areas will be interesting. He has spoken a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back to the US. I think that the Republicans will be constructive in those areas. We need all sources of energy to provide the supply to meet the growing power demands. So the fundamentals are incredibly constructive. I think the opportunity set is pretty significant, and to your point on having certainty, I'm hopeful like you that we'll start to have clarity through 2025. But the reality is, coming back to the themes he's talked about, energy affordability, energy security, that will create the right environment for investors such as you and ourselves to really help be part of the solution. With a Republican president, Senate, and House of Representatives ready to take over in January, 2025 looks to herald a more uncertain climate for the asset class. How that will impact capital flows to the US market in the near term remains to be seen. Infrastructure Investors Fundraising Report for the first nine months of 2024 indicates that Europe and Asia-Pacific are already closing the gap with North America in terms of regional fundraising volume. But regardless, the scale of the need and the opportunity that exists for private capital and infrastructure in the United States is undeniable. Couple that with the consensus that a Trump presidency is unlikely to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, and there's enough cause for investors to remain optimistic about the region's prospects.

### Macquarie: ‘Investors wonder whether there is truly an ability to achieve a higher risk premium in Asia’
**Publication Date:** 2024-12-05 08:00:00+00:00
**Episode ID:** 2605

**Full Transcript:**
According to a 2023 McKinsey report, Asia accounted for 57% of global GDP growth between 2015 and 2021, with over 50% of the world's trade involving Asia. Data from the United Nations shows that 65% of the world's middle class will be found in Asia by 2030. There's plenty to like for infrastructure investors, too. According to the Asian Development Bank, $1.7 trillion needs to be spent on Asian infrastructure annually until 2030, with up to $750 billion annually for digital infrastructure alone. Data from the International Energy Agency estimates that 46% of global renewables energy supply will be generated in Asia-Pacific by 2030. As an investment destination, you'd struggle to find a better set of fundamentals. Macquarie has been investing in Asia for 30 years, with a presence in 11 markets and over 4,000 employees. Joining me in today's episode is Verena Lim. Based in Singapore, Verena is the CEO of Macquarie Group Asia and the co-head of Asia-Pacific for Macquarie Asset Management Infrastructure. She is also the head of investments for the Macquarie Asia-Pacific Infrastructure Fund Series, one of the largest infrastructure platforms dedicated to investing in the Asia-Pacific. We talk about the need for diversity and discipline when investing in the region, Asia's growing popularity with LPs, increased competition from fund managers, and, of course, Macquarie's headline-grabbing Airtrunk exit. I'm Bruno Alves, Senior Editor of Infrastructure Investor, and this is the Infrastructure Investor Podcast. So we have a lot to talk about today, but I have to start with Airtrunk, which I think is surely the deal of the year, and also, I think, emblematic of Asia's infrastructure investment potential. So just to frame this for listeners who may not be familiar, Macquarie led the consortium that bought Airtrunk, which is a Pan-Asia data center business, for around $3 billion Australian dollars in 2020, and four years later, you've sold it to a Blackstone-led consortium for $24 billion Australian dollars. And during this ownership period, you helped increase Airtrunk's contracted capacity roughly eightfold, growing their data center portfolio from five to 11 assets. Was this the original growth plan? Was this what it looked like on day one, or did you find the growth accelerated because of AI coming onto the scene and some of the developments of recent years? Yeah, no, it's definitely been a great growth story for us. Thanks, Bruno, for mentioning it. And as you mentioned, our second Asia-PAC infrastructure fund, MAVE2, and some of our partners acquired 88% stake in early 2020. So at the time of acquisition, the portfolio was predominantly concentrated in Australia in terms of the data centers, and as you rightly point out, we've had at least close to 10 times growth in terms of contracted capacity. I think one of the key advantages or investment highlights for us at the time of entering the investment was we saw the potential for that data center portfolio to expand not only in Australia, but also into Asia. So since we own the asset, we've actually entered into four new markets, including six new sites in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, as well as Hong Kong. And again, a lot of that came much quicker in terms of growth than we had previously anticipated. And to your point about AI, I think that's certainly been one of the key factors for that amazing growth profile we've had in that period. And so it aligned well, I would say, with the fact that we could actually leverage Macquarie's broader network of regional and on the ground expertise to support Airtrunk's growth into these newer markets. Yeah, and I think that's a really good point that I wanted to explore with you, which is to really try and pinpoint what you, Macquarie, and the consortium you led, what you ended up doing for Airtrunk in that sense. And so was it what you've just described, i.e. you have this network and you sort of open doors for them? How did that work? Yeah, I mean, one of the things that we did as a team was, you know, just really leveraging what our US team had already done. We always thought that data centers from a digital infrastructure space was an area we really wanted to look into in Asia Pac. We spent quite a lot of time actually analyzing the spectrum of data center opportunities that an infrastructure investor could go into. Not everything in that spectrum we felt was infrastructure. So we spent, again, considerable amount of time where we wanted to play and the management teams that were forming in the market and to work out which management teams we really wanted to back in terms of that investment. And so, yeah, I mean, I think the one thing that Airtrunk had was obviously strong capabilities in Australia, but the founder and the existing management team really saw the benefit of partnering with someone like us because we've had history and years of footprint in the markets in Asia where they were most interested in expanding into. So our setup and team structure and network in markets like Singapore here, in Hong Kong, Japan, as well as now even in Malaysia with the new build into Johor, I think pretty much aligned well with the vision and strategy the Airtrunk management team had in terms of their next phase of growth in terms of data centers in this part of the world. So I think the ability for us to help them grow in these newer markets was something that we're continuing to be proud of and obviously very proud of the 10 times growth in contractor capacity we've had since that time. We talk a lot internally with the team when we're kind of looking at things like platform investing and growing platforms and valuing them, etc. So we talk a lot about that these days. And I wanted to ask you, when you bought Airtrunk in 2020, how much of the price tag or how much of what you were paying for was a recognition of the assets and contracts that Airtrunk had at the time versus this really strong growth potential that you saw? So I guess how much of it was for what was there versus what was coming, hopefully? Yeah, I think it's safe to say a lot of our medium term forecast that we had in our investment case was met very quickly into the ownership of Airtrunk. Certain markets, I would say, including Japan, the follow on growth that we saw in Southeast Asia, whether it be Singapore, as well as Johor, were opportunities that we had discussed briefly when we were doing due diligence. And it was something that the management team were reviewing at the time, but it was all quite preliminary. So it wasn't something that we had underwritten at the time of acquisition. But of course, when we looked at the investment thesis, there was quite a lot of potential to explore data centers into these new markets. It's just that something that we weren't actually valuing as part of the acquisition case when we went in early 2020. Sure. And just to pick up on an earlier point, which is, again, something that gets discussed a lot these days, you were just mentioning that you were looking at these data center assets and not everything made you comfortable from an infrastructure perspective. So I guess my question is kind of twofold. What made you comfortable from an infrastructure risk return perspective about Airtrunk? And conversely, what are the kind of no-goes when you look at these assets that you think, okay, this is an infrastructure, I'm not comfortable investing in this? Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. I think the one thing that we continue to do as a team is look at all of the fundamental characteristics that we would expect from an infrastructure investment, whether it be things that you would have heard of for many, many years now, you know, is it an essential service? Does it have high barriers to entry? How predictable and stable are your cash flows? Does it ultimately have that competitive moat if it's not a monopoly, for instance, and then really dissecting supply and demand market risk to come up with an answer? So it's not just data centers. We have done this work, obviously, we've done this work with other sectors or adjacent sectors that we've entered into, whether it's the industrial gas networks in Korea, or now even as we look into the healthcare space, we're doing the same type of work. I think it's really important to continue to do that as we think about adjacencies and adjacent growth to the core or traditional infrastructure opportunities that many of the infrastructure investors had been invested in many years back. But it's something that we have to look at, dissect in terms of the characteristics and convince ourselves, but also obviously our investors and co-investors who come along that journey to make sure that, you know, we don't have mandate creep. And I think that's a question that everybody needs to continue to ask themselves as they allocate capital. No, absolutely. So I have one last question about Airtrunk and then keen to move on to the wider discussion. But, you know, we've heard it from, I think it was a recent set of results that the exit ended up being, you know, so good and so profitable that you could realize a partial performance fee early on from Macquarie Asia Infrastructure Fund too, which held Airtrunk. So I don't know if you have like a Macquarie Hall of Fame for exits, but I just got curious, is this, you know, the best Macquarie asset management exits or how does it rank internally? Look, I think you've got a lot of media attention given the size of the transaction, but in terms of returns and whether you look at that from an IRR perspective or money multiples, it's not the only investment where we've had a similar success on exit. So if you look at, or I look at our entire Asia Pacific portfolio over the last three years, and we've had more than 10 divestments across the MAFE portfolio from an overall returns and, you know, both IRR and money multiple perspective. We've had obviously some in similar sort of camp as the money multiple that people are estimating on Airtrunk and others that are slightly below that. But overall, it's been obviously additive to the portfolio of exits that we've experienced in the last three years. So Macquarie, I think, and correct me here, but I think you have been investing in the region for more or less 30 years now. And certainly when I look at it from an infrastructure perspective and as a manager with dedicated infrastructure projects, it feels to me that for a good chunk of that time, Macquarie was sort of alone as a major fund manager with various products dedicated to Asia Pacific and its various countries. And so if I ask you to sort of cast your mind back to those earlier times, how easy was it to convince LPs to come along with you and invest in those early products? Yeah, I mean, look, our investors mainly comprise pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds. That's not just in relation to Asia Pacific, but across the globe. For Asia Pacific, the investor base, as an example for the MAFE series, is quite diverse. We've got investors located within Asia, in EMEA, as well as North America. And compared to about a decade ago, we are seeing more investors interested in learning more about the different markets in Asia and also seeing some of that interest convert into actual allocation, mainly for diversification reasons, but also to capture the higher risk premium in the more emerging markets within Asia. So I would say some of the investors who have a lot more experience, a little bit more sophisticated in terms of their dealings in this part of the world. It hasn't been too difficult for particularly when it comes to re-amps, but for the newer investors, some of them are still on that journey or education, I guess, to work out, you know, how much of a risk premium they should expect in this part of the world compared to, say, more developed markets in the U.S. or Europe. And you mentioned that maybe around a decade ago, if I ask you to think about when LP interest in the region started to accelerate, it certainly feels to us the last few years that that's been the case. In your experience, when did that acceleration begin? Yeah, I mean, look, I think it also ties with the maturity of the market. So when I first came to Singapore, and that was about 17 and a half years ago, I think it wasn't that obvious what infrastructure meant to a lot of our investors and what that asset class meant to some of these investors. And in particular, in this part of the world, you know, I think people were quite happy and busy allocating budgets to the more developed markets, whether it be Europe or U.S. or even Australia. And there wasn't specifically a need for people to look outside of their own backyards. But as, you know, we started to see a lot of the markets, including the emerging markets, become a lot more transparent, more favorable government and political regimes, more foreign investor friendly in some of the sectors that we're looking at. I think that provided a bit more conviction and confidence for that investor base to learn a little bit more about this part of the world and really allocate specific budgets into Asia Pac. And they are eager to engage in discussions about the market today a lot more than what they may have been about a decade ago. And so in that sense, if I'm an LP and I'm thinking about committing to Asia, why do you think I should be committing to Asia versus Europe or the U.S., for example? Yeah. And Bruno, that's a good question because I often get that from investors when they're first looking at allocating to Asia. I think investors are looking at risk adjusted returns and wondering whether there is truly an ability to achieve that higher risk premium in Asia compared to U.S. or Europe. So look, in terms of the macro dynamics, I think most people would understand the growth potential in Asia is driven by the strong macro tailwinds, including things like increased urbanization, population growth, middle income growth. But as a result of it being a less established market, there are clearly higher risks compared with investing in more developed market infrastructure strategies, which means unless these risks can be proactively managed and mitigated, you could end up with just more risk and not enough returns to compensate for that. So with the benefit of having been first movers in our case in many of these target markets, whether it be Korea, the Philippines, or even Indonesia, and having that long history of investing and operating in Asia overall, we believe that to really understand and manage those risks, there are a few things you really need. So the first I would say, you need to have people on the grounds who understand the cultural nuances, can speak the language, navigate the complexity and the relevant stakeholders when issues arise. But to be honest, building in that local presence where talent is also developing and potentially not yet at a mature stage relative to these other markets that you refer to, is also something you can't do overnight or within a short period of time here. So you do need to have patience and it takes time. If I can keep going, secondly, you need to have a tailored investment strategy per market given it's quite diverse. And I think you've heard this before, Asia is not homogenous. For us in our sort of our journey here, our investment strategy has continued to evolve. And although I think we still continue to learn and adapt to each market, we now believe we have a better idea of what works and what doesn't. And that allows us to be more agile and source proprietary transactions and have the execution capability to pursue larger and more complex transactions that some people may shy away from when they first see them. Thirdly, I would say diversification in the portfolio is critical. So not everything will go linear in Asia, so you need offsets. And based on our experience, and this may sound obvious, but not many people do it and we haven't always done it well. Having that geographical sector and time diversification has been hugely beneficial. And then finally, the last thing I would say, and we've been sort of reflecting as a team on how do we actually bridge the micro and macro dynamics so that you are delivering that higher risk premium or higher risk premium. As a team, I think you really need to be a lot more disciplined. So when you're investing in emerging markets, you need to make sure you're not solving to perfection in your business plans. Something that you may think may not happen actually could happen. And that's why, you know, my life is never dull here because something always happens. And so you need to have some buffer to solve for those issues. So if you take all those things into account, I think that really allows the macro positivity as well as the micro to align, in which case investors should see a higher risk premium compared to the other more developed markets. One thing, and you've just hit upon a key point, which is obviously we're talking about Asia. Asia is not a monolith. There are different markets, different speeds, different characteristics. And I want to explore some of that. But one thing you said that got me thinking was about risk management. And it got me thinking, do you feel there is a little bit of a gap between so-called perceived risks, which a lot of LPs may associate with some of these markets, and do they match the actual risks that you then end up having to manage? Or do you think the two aren't quite aligned, that sometimes what LPs think is going to be a problem actually isn't what turns out to be a problem and it's something else? I'm just curious because there's a lot of perceptions about these markets and the risks attached to them. Yeah, look, I think there is a huge benefit having been operating in these target markets for a long time. So when we look at risk, there is certainly risks in each of these target markets. And they may be actually transactional risk, but they can also be operational risk. But they may not necessarily be heightened as much as potentially some of the LPs may think there are, just purely by hearing from the media or from headline news. I think it's a little bit more nuanced than actually saying, you know, what's your view on X, Y, Z in this market, just because someone's read it in the headline news one day. But there are certain things per market where I think the benefit of that two decades of experience have shown us that there are certain things like regulatory risks in certain markets we feel is probably a little bit unquantifiable, and we probably wouldn't touch going forward. And I didn't really want to touch on China, but I think that's probably a good example where, you know, we went into China in 2009, obviously being first movers there, the strategy was to go into core infrastructure, and that would include roads or toll roads, ports, as well as water businesses, where you're facing off regulated entities or the government and state owned enterprises. And typically, some of this risk was something that we couldn't really sort of measure in terms of China, where the government, you know, at one point basically came out standardizing all of the toll rates across the nation, and then didn't pay compensation, for instance, as per the concession agreement, and that would not happen in other parts of the world, and including in other markets like India, where we've had really good successes in terms of that investment class. So these are the things that I think we have, you know, quite a lot of practical experience that, you know, we can sort of work through in some cases, but in some cases, we've already made the decision not to actually touch, but they may not be the same risk that you know, you're necessarily reading off a newspaper or seeing in the news. So real-life practical experience obviously helps us in measuring and mitigating risk, as mentioned. And one thing I was wanting to explore a bit more, you mentioned the need for diversity, and discipline also when investing in the region. And I would just like to hear a bit more about that, and how you think about it when you operate in the region, but also construct portfolios, because you have a mixture of country funds, and then more recently, I would say that the Pan-Asian series. So how do you think about that? And how do you select markets? How have you been building your business across the region? Yes, so you're right. We did have country-specific strategies when we first started here. We started off after Australia, we went into Korea in the early 2000, and we decided to go deep per market because we understood that Asia is not homogenous, and there was quite a lot of benefit at that time to go in deep, create that knowledge base, have the experience, also create that local talent in each of these markets. So the idea was to go deep per market. And then it was really in 2014, when these country-specific funds were fully deployed or end of investment period, we decided that it was the right time at that point in time to set up a regional platform through the MACE series, as mentioned. And a lot of it was also investor-led. A lot of the investors basically said, look, Asia's really hard, hard to really optimally allocate capital unless you've got boots on the ground. Macquarie having now been in the region for more than a decade or so, doesn't it make sense to create that regional diversified portfolio? And that began the establishment of the MACE. And I do think now with the markets maturing, with the fact that we've got the experience and the capability set per market, and again, that's with the benefit of having done the country-specific strategies, we're now in a really good position to create that more diversified portfolio. And in this part of the world, every single market within Asia are on a sort of different time horizon, that they're at a different maturity level when it comes to investment lifecycle and it's emerging. So it evolves and you need to rapidly sort of adapt to any pivots or changes in terms of the environment. So really the country-specific strategies obviously helped us do that, created the strategy or the right strategy as well as the capabilities on the ground. But I think, you know, at this point in time and where each of these markets are heading, having that more diversified portfolio with the MACE series allows us to do big deals like Airtrunk, as you've mentioned, but also allows us to scale across the portfolio, which is obviously beneficial. Are there any countries that you are awaiting to enter, but for whatever reason, you haven't been able to? And is it because of the pipeline isn't there or maybe the regulation, the regulatory environment isn't quite there? I guess I'm kind of asking what may be next on your list of countries to enter. Yes. So look, our geographical target or footprint is quite broad. And so I still think there's quite a lot of opportunities that need to be unlocked in the existing markets that we're exploring, whether within Southeast Asia, that's Philippines or Indonesia. If you may recall, we only recently went into Indonesia only a couple of years ago. So we feel like there's probably a lot more to do there than necessarily going into other more frontier markets within Southeast Asia. We continue to see really good opportunities in markets like Australia, as well as Korea. The one market that has been a target market that has been relatively difficult to unlock has been Japan. But recently we did the deal with Rakuten Group, which was a sale and lease back of their tower business. And that combined with the fact that I think there is quite a lot of pressure from the government in Japan for a lot of the Japanese corporates to act more efficiently, think about governance in a different way, but also ultimately maximize shareholder value, I think could potentially unlock opportunities from either both a corporate carve out situation or take private situation in Japan that may not necessarily have been available to us several years back. So I think there's more to be done in the existing markets that we're looking at. But we wouldn't be looking at new markets for the purpose of just broadening. We would need confidence. Again, the only reason why we went into these markets in the first place was because we felt convicted by their regulatory framework, their political stability, their foreign investment policies that allows us to not just have flow in each of these markets from a macro perspective, but we can convert this flow into something more executable. That makes sense. And I wanted to ask you, as of the last few years, there are now more and more managers with APAC dedicated funds operating in the region. And I'm thinking of your Stone Peaks and your KKRs, etc. And I'm curious how you see that increased competition and what it means for the region, whether it makes it a little bit harder maybe to get the deals or the risk premium that you want. How do you see that increased competition? Yes. So, look, I think having more managers here investing in infrastructure is net positive. Firstly, it credentializes what Macquarie has been doing for a very long time. But it also means to stay at the top, you can't be complacent. You need to continue to be on your feet. Think about how you can differentiate yourselves from others. And I think that's great for the industry and the markets we're trying to support in terms of providing quality and sustainable infrastructure. When we look at divesting our investments, it's been actually good to see the mix and depth of universal buyers increase. So unlike five years ago, we now have actually a really good balance of both strategic and financial investors. And that just allows us to maximize value for our funds and investors. In terms of investing, so capital deployment, I think if the strategy really is to just compete on cost of capital, then increased competition isn't great. But if you have a strategy of finding investment opportunities where you have a clear value add plan, and know you have the capabilities and the experience to execute on that value add plan, as well as have the ability to access the deep networks that have been established over a period of time, then the ability to source proprietary opportunities still remains strong. So for example, we've actually managed to do that in Korea with the consolidation of the waste to energy businesses a couple of years ago. We've also consolidated the petrochemical storage terminals in Japan, but also more recently in digital investments in Indonesia through Basama Digital. And for May 3, despite the increased competition and capital flow into this part of the world, all of the investments we've made to date have been done on a proprietary basis, which has been really great to see. And I think further, given our history, track record, and the teams we've built during this period, we have the ability to navigate complexity, which I mentioned before. So whether that's in terms of the transaction itself, or any operational complexity we see, we can definitely leverage the teams we've got to capitalize on the opportunities that presents. Does it make it harder from a competitive point of view when it comes to team building and team retention? Because you now have other people competing for talent, and poaching, or hiring people that you would have wanted to hire. How is that dynamic changing? I think just overall, if you look at the retention levels across our business, it's pretty good. We haven't really had any real regrettable turnover. Obviously, we can't prevent people from thinking about alternative options as we've got more of these fund managers setting up, but to date, the team has stayed pretty close together and intact for most part of it. The other thing we are proactively doing is given we are also looking at adjacent infrastructure businesses that we may not always have had the ability to prosecute on, we're also looking at strengthening our existing teams and trying to fill any capability gaps we've got by looking at the market more broadly, and finding people and hiring people to supplement the team. So I think it works both ways, actually. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And I guess my final question, you've been three decades in the region. So I'm wondering, first, what are the top lessons that you've learned from your time deploying capital there? And also, what's next for Macquarie in Asia Pacific? Yeah, so I think we've learned quite a lot of lessons learned and probably don't have enough time to go through all of those case studies. But I think the key thing for us is making sure you're true to your strategy. So we're not just looking at deals just because they're in play or in the market. The deal needs to fit the strategy, not the other way around. And then a bit more sort of nuance per market, but I guess more generally speaking, we need to make sure we have the right and appropriate governance to be able to really execute on the underwrite case and the business plan. There've been far too many examples where if that was a little bit misaligned, or we didn't have the appropriate governance to go in and do what we need to do, particularly when an issue arises, that's when things went sort of pear-shaped. So I think that's probably a big lesson that we've learned per market over the three decades that you mentioned. And also alignment. If there is a partnership, someone else where we are not necessarily the only shareholder, making sure that there is alignment, not just on the operations, but also when we're thinking about how do we exit this investment opportunity down the track, probably the things we would make sure that we get that right going forward. What's next? The continuation of what's in place, or do you have other plans perhaps that haven't surfaced yet? No, I think we're pretty pleased with what we've got in place. And we want to continue to make sure we're driving the performance of our existing funds and strategies, but also really think about growing our footprint here and doing the interesting investments that we've recently done and really unlocking opportunities, but also trying to look at the boundaries and see whether there's anything innovative and more interesting that we haven't done before, but still keep within what we believe is within mandate. So that's the current focus. That, again, was Verena Lim, Macquarie Group's Asia CEO.
