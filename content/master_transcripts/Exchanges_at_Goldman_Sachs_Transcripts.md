Some heavily shorted stocks connected to well-known consumer brands or heavily debated themes have been surging. Why? And what does that tell us about this equity market as a whole? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by John Marshall, head of derivatives research in Goldman Sachs Research. John, welcome back to Exchanges. Thanks for having me. So, John, we are suddenly seeing some very big moves in some unexpected stocks. So give us the update. What is going on? Yes, we're seeing broadly volumes pick up, particularly in the options market. And we can trace that back to small traders or retail traders that are increasing activity. This has been happening over the last few weeks, but has really only come to light in the past few days, really, with the big up moves in select stocks. And so when we talk about these stocks that are moving sharply, they're often called meme stocks. But give us a definition of what that actually means. How do you define a meme stock? Well, meme stock, I think of literally as stocks that the internet is focused on and therefore retail traders become focused on. Now, surfing the internet and trying to nail down which stocks those are, even by quantitative measures, usually fails. What we've found works is really monitoring volumes, small trades in specific stocks, tracking that in shares and in options, and that can enable people to get ahead of these trends. All right. Interesting. So you are bringing back a lot of memories of 2021 when we had, I think in my recollection, like really the first meme craze. So ultimately, when you think about how does this compare to that period, which was during the pandemic, so that felt like a strange time. Yeah. When we measure it quantitatively based on volumes, it looks like this is about half as big. And frankly, this type of wave happens about every six months. We saw one back in January. We saw one in July of last year. And so these waves come and go. And I think one of the things that's interesting about them is it starts out as a retail wave and then short covering among institutional investors tends to drive it even higher. Right. So that drives the volatility and some of these really big moves we're seeing. But I guess my question is, yes, you say we see them every six months, but this does feel bigger at least to me than what we have seen more recently. So why now for this renewed focus on these types of trades? Yeah. It's a great question. It is coincident with the passing of a couple of bills in Congress, the tax bill and crypto related bills. And so I think we're seeing some of the names or some of the themes that show up in the meme stock rally be in areas that are exposed there. In particular, a lot of them are crypto or blockchain related. Some of them are AI related. And there are certainly some retail related names, but it's more of these new technologies, new areas that are growth engines for the future. And so again, when we put this all together, ultimately what is driving this? Is it investor behavior? Is it market conditions? Both? Yeah. I think it's optimism about the future, optimism about the medium term growth potential for some of these areas. And that gets retail investors excited. It leads people to think about upside asymmetry through buying call options, which is a big part of this. And it is really tough to refute in the near term. And so I think they feel emboldened. And I want to dig into what you just said a little bit in terms of how retail investors are getting exposure. You just mentioned options. Are they mostly using options? Is anyone buying the underlying stocks? Yes. So it's both and it's different for each underlying name. Some of them are being bought in shares. Some of them are being bought in options. But what's really interesting about the option buying, it tends to be the bigger effect. Because when you buy an out of the money option, it has small exposure to a stock. But if that stock rallies, and then that call is worth more and has more stock exposure, it becomes a bigger position. So it's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy that you get more upside exposure through options as the stock rallies. Right. So retail investors are savvy about this, are trying to get the biggest bang for their buck. Yes. Assuming a lot of upside, that's where they want to be. Let me ask you the question I think you're getting most asked, which is how long will this last? Some of these rallies have actually fizzled even over the course of a day. So are we in for any sustained move here or is this all going to be very fleeting? We find that generally this type of activity is measured in weeks. Our particular quantitative metrics use a two-week average to predict the activity over the next one week. So one could think about that kind of meaning if we see waning activity for two weeks in a row, then the next week is likely to be down. So from a activity perspective. And so what that tells us is we have not yet reached a peak, or as of yesterday, we were continuing to move higher in activity. And so this likely has some legs. Some legs. But over weeks, we're not talking months. Correct. Or beyond. Got it. Okay. So you mentioned in one episode, you had a lot of long, short hedge funds that kind of got caught wrong-footed in that environment. Are they better prepared in this type of environment to deal with these types of moves? Yes, I believe so. Most of them are better prepared. The ones that respect the activity that's happening in the volumes in the market by retail and options and monitor it and look for these two-week increases in order to get out of the way ahead of that and not get too rooted in their fundamental view, which fundamentals change as well. So I think that our hedge fund clients have been more adaptive, and that's why it hasn't been quite as painful as the 2021 episode. It's really just striking how much things change. And five years ago or 10 years ago, this wasn't a thing at all, but now it's something that hedge funds really have to be focused on. Absolutely. So when you think about what the smart long, short managers are doing right now, what is it? Well, I think that there's really two things. One, they're monitoring the situations, understanding at the single stock level, because this is really, while we're talking about it as a broader theme, this is really stock by stock. There are about 30 to 50 names on any given day that retail may be paying attention to. The list may be 60 at this point, and so it might be a little bit bigger than normal, but that type of focus is not on the whole market. It's on these 30 to 50 names typically. And so by becoming aware of the movements in those, they can focus on what's really impacting the stocks rather than throwing their hands up and hedging with some broad instrument. And so are these hedge funds really just monitoring the internet at this point to kind of anticipate? I mean, how do you go about tracking what could move next? Yeah, it's a great question. There are certainly people who are monitoring the internet and have developed ways of scraping the internet and coming up with lists, and there are several other smaller services out there that do that. But the quantitative investors that I talk to have been wholly disappointed with that method. And the one that we've found when we quantitatively look at what predicts the future stock prices or option prices, it's really the volumes tell you where retail investors are acting, not just what they're talking about. And I think that that is the most important thing for predicting the future. Well, you got to get in on that quick though, because when you see the volumes going up, these things don't last that long as we just discussed. And another interesting point you just made, these are a small set of particular stocks. Can it move the broader index or is this too small of a phenomenon? This phenomenon in particular is unlikely to move the broad index, as we've seen relatively small moves in the index over the last couple of weeks as this has been happening. However, it is absolutely a positive sign. I would not read this as a negative sign for the broad market, people taking risks on stocks that are levered to the future and levered to, frankly, broader corporate growth. And I think that that's a positive sign for the S&P in general. Right. So this is a sign of risk on sentiment, as we call it in the markets. But ultimately, at what point does it go too far? I mean, can that be also a warning signal in some sense? Yes, it could. In this particular situation, we've seen a period of about three months prior to this where retail investors had slowed their buying. They bought significantly in January through April, all through the tariff turmoil in early April. They were buyers in ETFs and in shares across tech stocks, across the broad market. Then they paused for about three months. The buying kind of went flat. It wasn't as if retail investors were selling and that buying appears to come back. That bodes well for the amount of money because the job market has been good. And so they've been continuing to accumulate dollars and it bodes well for the ability to continue to deploy that for some time. And that leads us to believe this could last longer than just a few more weeks. Right. So some dry powder from the retail investor base coupled with this positive sentiment means that this is probably not going to be a lasting phenomenon, but has some legs. Absolutely. Last year, we saw in the July period, we saw a similar rally. It wasn't quite as big as this one in retail sentiment. And then news from abroad in early August caused a drawdown in the market. There's always the potential for external activity like that to affect the market, but it's looking like there's a lot of firepower. And when I think about the timing of all this, we are at the end of July now, August is historically not a very high liquidity month. So could that amp up the volatility related to this over the course of the next several weeks? I believe it could, but retail investors also go on vacation. So there's the possibility that volume will come down as normal, but that doesn't necessarily mean the market has to. So should we just assume that meme stock episodes are a permanent feature of the market at this point? Absolutely. I think what the meme stock craze in 2021 told us, it brought to light how big a part of markets retail investors really are. There's 60% of single stock options trading is retail investors, something like 25% of shares trading. And in short dated index options, they may be 80 or 90% of the customer volume. So retail investors are a hugely important part of the markets. And I think we've gained an appreciation as a market community that they're a big factor in how stocks behave. And that's a big shift, by the way, from 10 years ago. Absolutely. Thanks, John. Always so insightful. Thank you for having me, Alison.

So why is that? And is there a risk that investors have become too complacent? I'm Alisa Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by Jan Hatzias, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, and Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in the Global Markets Research Group. Jan, Dom, it's great to have you back on Exchanges again. Thank you. A pleasure. Jan, as I just said, the markets seem very complacent about tariff risk at this point, but a lot is still happening around them. So first, just catch us up, what's been implemented so far on the tariff front, and what do you expect to be implemented ahead? So far, we've seen about a 9 percentage point increase in the average effective tariff rate on all U.S. imports, which is composed of 30% China tariffs, 25% Canada, Mexico, ex-U.S. MCA, 10% on a broad range of countries, and then some sector-specific tariffs, especially on autos and on steel and aluminum. We're expecting that 9 percentage point increase to go to something like 14 by the end of the year, and we've been in that general vicinity for several months at this point. It really hasn't changed very much, although the details keep changing and are probably going to continue to change. Our current expectation is that the 5 percentage point increment from here is going to be an increase in the sort of general baseline rate of from 10 to 15, and then we'll also get some additional sector-specific tariffs on things like semiconductors. However, in our baseline, we pushed back our expectation of pharma tariffs into late next year or early the year after the midterm elections. So the latest changes have been sort of a wash. So it is a very sizable increase in tariffs, much bigger than what we expected coming into the year, but somewhat below where we were expecting it in early April and very stable, actually, in terms of the average rate over the last several months. So the key question remains, what will this all mean for inflation? We got another round of U.S. inflation data this week, and it was yet again somewhat cooler than expected, and that's been the case for several months now. So will we see a tariff impact on inflation? And if so, when will we see it? Yeah. So I'd say on the latest inflation data, on balance, I think they were in line, where if I look at where our estimate is for core PCE in June, which is what all of these CPI, PPI import price numbers feed into, we're at 25 basis points. That's basically what we had coming into this set of reports. I do think that there's actually more evidence of pass-through into consumer prices in specific categories that you could reasonably expect to already have been affected by tariff increases on China, the first rounds of China tariffs that have been in place for a while now, the steel and aluminum tariffs. So I actually think that is happening, but it's happening gradually, partly because there was a lot of inventory building ahead of the tariffs, and it's also offset in part by still ongoing improvement outside the tariff effective categories, in particular in services and rents. So our expectation is still that we will see increases in year-over-year core PCE inflation from the sort of mid-to-high twos, where we've been for quite a while now, to the low threes. That's still our view. However, I also think that most likely this is a price level effect, a little bit like a value-added tax increase that we've seen in Europe many times that boosts inflation meaningfully for a period of time, 12 months, and then it drops out. And I think what we've seen on inflation expectations, especially longer-term inflation expectations, supports that over the past several months. And there's also some impact on growth from these tariffs. What are your expectations at this point? Some of the ways in which tariffs affect growth have proven to be, I think, definitely less dramatic. We're seeing less of an uncertainty impact that's clearly visible in the data. And in fact, some of the uncertainty measures have come down. Of course, so far, we haven't seen a huge real income hit either because we're still in the early stages of the pass-through. So you could say that what we're learning here is that this is not such a big deal. On the other hand, actual growth in the first half of 2025 actually has been pretty soft. Right now, we're estimating first half GDP growth only 1.2% on average. You have to take Q1 and Q2 together because of the massive front-loading distortions in the quarterly numbers. But I think the half-year as a whole is a more reasonable perspective. So it does seem that growth actually has slowed a substantial amount, in part because of tariffs, maybe in part because of other things that are harder to identify. We've also seen a slowdown in employment growth. Private sector employment growth has come down meaningfully. It was well below 100,000 in the June numbers. In fact, the ADP numbers, which I think deserve some weight as a private payroll processor figure, was even weaker than that. So it does seem that we're on a slower growth pace. We're still expecting 1% to 1.5% growth in 2025 as a whole. I would say that some of the forward-looking soft indicators, survey indicators have looked a little bit better. So consistent with maybe some stabilization. But it's a slower growth year without much doubt. Dominic, let me turn to you. Jan just said, we have seen some meaningful slowing in growth. And of course, tariff risks are still very much with us. Yet the markets are at very strong levels, especially equity market in particular. Has that been surprising at all? The market reaction in general to these recent developments? It's pretty striking. I think it's getting less surprising over time. I feel like really this is a theme. We're reinforcing it. But it's a theme that's been going on since mid-April, which is that the markets essentially moved to a position where they feel like they know some weaknesses coming in the economy. I think people expect the tariffs to have impact. But as Jan said, as the kind of parameters have become clearer, we've had this sort of high but fairly stable expected tariff outcome for a while. I think people have just got more comfortable that this is going to be a meaningful one-off adjustment, but that you're not going to have a kind of extended period of weakness. And then people essentially, particularly I think in the equity market, feel comfortable extending their horizon, looking through that weakness and anchoring more on the medium-term growth picture. I think it is striking again, this latest sort of escalation and the renewed kind of tariff letters coming around definitely haven't shaken that confidence at all on the growth side. It is striking if you look across different markets, and you mentioned that equities in particular have been relaxed. If you look at inflation markets, we have priced over the last few weeks, I think, a recognition that tariffs are going to go up. The market's pricing more near-term inflation. So it's not that the market is discounting that completely. But I think it is much less worried about the kind of growth and risk consequences of that. And I think, again, there are sort of three basic assumptions that the market's making around that. The first is there's this sort of modest expectation that things will get dialed back and resolved. I think the fact that you're seeing inflation pricing rise suggests it's not mostly about that. The market does think more tariffs are probably coming. But I do think there's been the greater sense that adjustments will be made if problems arise. The second, which is what Jan referenced, is that I do think the worst of the economic impacts just look less visible. We're clearly seeing weakness, but we're not seeing all of the weakness that perhaps people worried we might see initially. Financial conditions tightening has reversed. The uncertainty impacts, as Jan said, are smaller. So I think there's just a general sense that the kind of deeper tail risks and economic tail risks are not as troubling. And I would say the third is just this general notion that the market doesn't really need to believe that there won't be an impact from tariffs. They just need to believe that it's not going to be a sustained impact. If we have some quarters of weakness as we adjust to this new regime, but life goes on on the other side of that and growth returns, which is more or less the flavor of our forecast, that's something I think where the market can get broadly comfortable. It does point, you know, you asked about complacency. I think that's probably too strong, but it points to where the vulnerability lies in that in terms of those assumptions. Those assumptions are not that different from our central case. But anything that shakes that idea that you can plausibly look through the weakness, anything that raises the fear again that something recessionary is on the horizon or that we might have to worry about a kind of more dramatic shift in the economic outlook, you know, cracks in the labor market, things we haven't really seen yet, but are still an ongoing risk. That's where I think the market will find itself from this current position vulnerable. But if we don't touch that, then I think we're going to continue to look forward to the medium term picture and anchor on that. We could probably come back to that in this conversation. But let me hit on some of the other big developments that have happened since we last spoke, one of which, Jan, of course, is Trump's fiscal package. The big, beautiful act has passed, and there was so much buildup to that passage. What will be the implications? Will it move the needle at all on growth? It's going to have a positive impact on near term growth taken by itself because it is fiscally expansionary. The tax cuts are bigger than the spending cuts, and the tax cuts also arrive more quickly than the spending cuts. And so that's fiscally stimulative in early 2026, probably to the tune of a few tenths of a percentage point, maybe as much as half a percentage point. But it doesn't include the tariff impact. And if you look at it from a revenue perspective, it is actually a bit more neutral once the tariff impact is included. And I think the growth effects ultimately are going to be offset by the tariff effect. So we haven't really made major changes on the back of this. We also haven't made major changes to our deficit projections. We still think that we're on track for 6% of GDP federal deficits, pretty much as far as the eye can see, or at least until there's a more sustained effort to consolidate the budget outlook. 6% of GDP, that's a big number. It means a large primary deficit, X interest deficit of maybe 3% of GDP. And that probably means ongoing increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio, again, pretty much as far as the eye can see. And that's a reason, and we may come back to this, also for longer-term premia, the amount of compensation that investors demand for holding long-term treasuries for those term premia to probably add up over time. So the fiscal outlook remains concerning. We're certainly not in the camp that there's a fiscal crisis coming anytime in the near term. But over time, I do think the risk that you have these sort of mini crises, and we've seen some of this again and again over the last several years, I think that risk does go up. So if I listen to what you're saying about these recent developments, basically growth is continuing, but at a relatively slower pace. Inflation is set to rise a bit from here, but really we're looking at a one-off effect. What is the implication of all this for the Fed? You just started to mention term premium. What are your Fed expectations at this point? Yeah, look, we're at a level of short-term interest rates that is above basically anybody's estimate of where the funds rate will be in the long term, the natural rate of interest or however you want to call it. Most people have that somewhere in the low threes, maybe low to mid threes. We're now in the low to mid fours. So it's a question of when that adjustment comes in a broadly neutral economic environment. Our expectation is that they're going to start moving down in September. We have a 25 basis point cut in September. We've got two more cuts at the subsequent two meetings and then another 50 basis points in total in 2026 to get you down to the low threes. And the timing of this is driven by really news on when they're going to be sufficiently confident that this really is a one-off inflation effect. And I think sometime September is a reasonable time frame. I think there's very little chance that anything happens in July. So almost by definition, that means the risks to September are on the later side. It could be a little bit later, but this is our current baseline. Dom, let me ask you what the rates markets are making of all of this. We have discussed inflation risk, fiscal risk. There is another risk that's been very much in focus this week, the change in Fed leadership that is upcoming and the potential to potentially have a new Fed chair that is dovish leaning. So how is the rates market digesting all of this? As I said, we've seen some swinging backwards and forwards coming off the tariff fears. Initially, April into May, we had one of those rounds of worries that Jan mentioned about bond markets and yields went up a lot at the back end of the yield curve. Then we got some meaningful relaxation after that, helped by some of the better inflation news. We had FOMC members starting to talk about maybe cutting rates more quickly and some sort of excitement about the possibility of an earlier easing. I think the resilience of the job market in particular and just general data since then has blunted those hopes a bit. So now we're shifting back towards dialing back some of that optimism. As Jan said, we're pricing September a little bit over a 50% chance. As Jan said, there's still lots of ways. I think it's easy to see how the case for cuts opens up and opens up more quickly again. In particular, as I said, the market is pricing a higher inflation track now than the forecast that we have. So if you combine that with relatively good growth pricing, it's easy to see how there's a little bit more softness in the data on the growth of labor market side. Certainly, if the inflation news continues to track well, the Fed's going to, as they've been signaling, step off from talking about easing to actually doing it. So our general view has been, as the market winds back its sort of expectations of easing with a view like, Jan and the teams, you should start to push back against that at the front end of the yield curve. I think the story for the longer end of the yield curve is, in some ways, a little bit the other way around. Jan mentioned as well, the fiscal position is, we're not worried about imminent crisis, but you have a lot of supply to be digested still. You have an economy that is functioning with reasonable growth. And what we're seeing is the sort of periodic upward pressure, this periodic upward pressure on longer dated yields. And I think without meaningful economic weakness, it's going to be hard to pull back a lot away from those levels. And on that side of things, I think our view is that it's the opposite way around. That if there's meaningful relief in yields, then you should probably get ready for things to drift back up. Implicit in that is a view that the yield curve will steepen, that the front's more likely to go down relative to the back. And that's been what's happening. And I think that's an ongoing trend. You mentioned the Fed chair, that is coming, I would say, at least in the market discussions, people have moved on from the fiscal debate. Now the bill has become an act and the Fed chair discussion is more prominently in focus. And we've seen obviously sort of market movement around some of the kind of rumours and announcements around that. I do think that's something where the risk of someone who might push more actively for easier monetary policy is something that would probably reinforce that steepening dynamic in yield curves and probably also contribute to some further pressure on the dollar, which is the pattern that we've seen when those issues have temporarily entered the market. Jan, how real do you think that risk is, that we are looking at a Fed leadership that might lean dovish because that is clearly what the administration wants? I think over time, I do think that the administration is going to be able to make, of course, several Fed appointments. And my expectation is that there will be an orderly transition. And that's the latest, I think, turn that the president has, what he's said. But yeah, my expectation is there will be a new Fed chair. I don't know who it's going to be, but I think it's going to be in May 2026. There are three appointments to the board of governors that President Trump is probably going to make. There are 19 people around the table. There are 12 voters at any one time. So there's a lot of institutional stability. And the Fed chair, of course, has a very important role in shaping the discussion and setting the agenda and working with the staff. But there's still a broader structure and a broader set of people. So I don't think it's going to be a dramatic shift in terms of actual policy setting that we're going to see over the next year. I think it's still going to be driven by the economic data and the Fed, the collective wisdom that Fed officials bring or collective views and analysis of the data. I don't think it's going to be a massive shift. And independence of monetary policy is very important. We've written some things about it this year. And I would say there was more concern around the possibility that the president gets the ability to remove Fed officials without cause before the Supreme Court decision that basically carved out the Fed from the president's ability to make those kinds of changes. But I think I do take the Supreme Court decision as an affirmation of the importance of independent monetary policy. Interesting. Let's turn to the dollar, because while U.S. equities have more than recovered from the April Liberation Day drop, the dollar has not. Jan, you recently said that the dollar is the dog that didn't bark. What did you mean by that? I meant that concerns about the U.S. economy have receded. Expectations of relative U.S. economic performance are not as negative as they were in April, when we thought that it was basically a knife edge case whether we were going to have a recession. And in fact, for a very brief period of two hours on April 9th, we had a recession forecast, but it seemed very touch and go. Things have stabilized for a variety of reasons that we've discussed. But nevertheless, on net, the dollar has continued to depreciate. And I think that drives home that the dollar depreciation is driven not just by the cyclical ups and downs of the near-term growth outlook, but really also driven by several longer-term factors, some of which we've discussed. But the dollar is still very highly valued on a broad trade-weight basis. And that historically sets up for depreciation in coming years. The U.S. still runs a very large current account deficit that needs to be financed by equal-sized capital inflows. And then I think there are some of these more tail-risk concerns around things like Fed independence that probably also have an impact on how foreign investors perceive the investments in the U.S. All of these things are happening at the margin. This is something that our team, Dom, Kamaksha Trivedi, and team have really emphasized that this is not about a fire sale. It's about making it a little bit more difficult to obtain the capital inflows that are needed to cover the current account deficit. And all of these prices are ultimately set at the margin. And I think what we're seeing in price action is that these effects are coming through. So, Dom, do you think that dollar weakness has much further to run at this point? Yeah, the general view is that it does. And for exactly the reasons that Jan mentioned, that structurally, there are a lot of these forces in place that traditionally have led to fairly extended periods of dollar realignment. And if you look at where we started from in terms of valuation, if you look at where people are in that reallocation and those hedging decisions, we think we're probably in the middle of that process rather than at the end. You know, it gets more complicated as time goes on. I think partly because dollar weakness is now a pretty well-accepted story. It's always better when you feel like something that other or believe something that other people don't yet believe. I think the nature of the dollar weakening trend has changed. We're deeper into that cycle. We've talked in other contexts across markets about keeping the faith. And I think the story now more is that confidence that this is a process that still has room to go and that when it gets challenged temporarily for some of the kind of cyclical reasons that come up from time to time, that you should not give up your confidence that the story is going to extend. And I think we're having a little bit of that at the moment. As Jan said, the big picture story is that despite a lot of relief about the U.S. economy in the second quarter, the dollar continued depreciating even after the reversal in a lot of other asset markets. But just over the last couple of weeks, as we've got better growth news in the U.S., as we've dialed back some of that kind of Fed expectation with people already fairly heavily positioned, we're getting a little bit more dollar support again. And you can see people's confidence in the theme, even though it's something people are quite heavily subscribed to. You can see that confidence waning. We're getting a lot more kind of incoming questions about whether the shifts are done. And I think that it is one of those moments where, in some sense, what's distinctive about the view now is that belief that we're probably midway through a more extended adjustment to deal with some of those kind of flow imbalances that Jan talked about, and that that doesn't stop some ebb and flow through the course of these things. We had a very long dollar depreciation, 2002 to 2005, and then beyond that. And there were definitely periods where the dollar strengthened. But when you step back and look at the broader trend, what is a kind of sustained depreciation story? And I think unless something changes very dramatically to reinforce the U.S. sort of exceptionalism theme again, I think that's the environment we're in. I did want to ask you about that, because I struggled to find a view that is more of a consensus view than the soft dollar view at this moment. So I was going to ask you if that gave you pause. Yeah, the answer is, I think it makes it more complicated. It means you're more likely to have these sort of moments of challenge. And as I said, then what becomes distinctive is continuing to hold your view or add to your view or retain that commitment as other people become more nervous about it. But it definitely increases the chance that there's a bit more back and forth. Right. So, Jan, when you think about the second half of the year, recap your expectations for the U.S., but really globally, what are your expectations for growth? Not too much change. So a reasonably fairly subdued growth pace. For example, in Europe, we don't expect a lot of growth sequentially in the second half of the year. Although I would say that in general, European growth has come in a little bit ahead of expectations for several quarters now. And there are some reasons to think that some of this borrowed growth, there was a front loading boost. I mean, I think a real front loading boost in some U.S. partner economies because there was a desire to import and that benefited the European industrial sector. But so the second half of the year, I think, could be pretty soft in terms of sequential GDP growth. But we still think we're in a kind of 1% environment for the euro area. We're probably seeing a pretty sizable fiscal boost in Germany over the next couple of years. So we think one and a half, maybe close to 2% growth for a period of time. The challenges for the German economy from industrial structure competition with China, energy costs, all of those structural challenges are definitely still there. But with the much more expansionary fiscal policy that's providing a lift, and that's also visible to a lesser degree in the euro area as a whole. Similarly, I'd say China, China continues to be an economy with a very strong industrial sector that continues to upgrade and a still challenged domestic sector. Demographics are bad. The hope that housing would end its long slide that I heard quite a lot about a couple of months ago, those have again given way to disappointment. The latest house price numbers have been quite weak. So it's a very bimodal economy. Our overall forecast for GDP growth in China continues to be basically four and a half or a little bit more than four and a half percent, which is effectively where we've been all year with a short period where we thought it was going to be four or less when you had the sky high U.S. tariffs. But what we found is that the Chinese industrial sector has been remarkably able to deal with the ups and downs of U.S. tariffs, even during the highest U.S. tariff levels, the overall exports from China didn't really decline. Exports to the U.S. declined. Exports to the U.S. are still down somewhere in the mid 20 percent range. But nevertheless, overall exports in the goods producing sector in general continues to be pretty resilient. Interesting. So if you think about the second half of the year, what risks are you most focused on that could derail some of your views? There is, of course, a big tariff deadline. There potentially are going to be more tariff deadlines. We're focused on August 1st. There is the 30 percent Europe threat. There is a 30, 35 percent Canada, Mexico, ex-USMCA threat. There is a number of other threats out there. We're building that into our forecast to a much more limited extent. We have a 15 percent baseline tariff up from 10. But of course, it's possible that these things actually take effect the way that the reciprocal tariffs and full reciprocal tariffs took effect, albeit only for a few hours, on April 9th. So that's risk number one. The Fed chair discussion is going to continue. We're going to learn more in the next several months. Probably there's going to be a candidate that will have been identified. Even if the removing Chair Powell concerns come and go, even if that isn't where we go, we will learn more about who the next Fed chair is. And I think that's going to have a significant impact. Those would be, from a US perspective, probably the top two things on my agenda. And, Dom, I think the question we all get is, what could shake these equity markets from these highs? So what are your biggest worries there? Yeah, look, I think there are a lot of things that could provide local challenges. We're pricing inflation growth in a pretty friendly way, as we discussed before. We're looking through the tariff threats and treating those as manageable. Lots of things that could cause some local wobbles. I think in terms of more serious challenges, the primary one, and not to be too reductive, I think the list narrows. If you look back over the last 12 months, and you think we've had two big equity drawdowns and sort of volatility events, one in August 2024 and one in April 2025. And what they both have in common is that they were heavily focused around, like, real fear that a recession was coming. And I think what we're learning is that's the biggest source of risk for deeper vulnerability in equities. If the market thinks the unemployment rate is set to rise properly in a way that we really haven't seen for a while, that is the sort of thing I think we've seen visibly creates a lot of risk aversion and creates a lot of worry, particularly from this sort of very benign level of pricing. Right. And, of course, we are not expecting a recession. So we're not expecting. So I would say it's a tail risk. It's an important tail risk, but that is obviously not the baseline view. So given that baseline view, what are your key messages for investors right now? So I would say, echoing the things that we've said, there are probably four things. The first is there are some structural things that we think are trends that are going on now that we think are going to continue. Dollar weakness being one of the key ones, that pressure towards a sort of steepening of the yield curve, perhaps somewhat lower yields at the front end of the yield curve, and this periodic testing of yields higher at the back end. And one of the things which we haven't talked about here, but our commodities team has been very consistent about is over the medium term, move lower in oil prices over time and the skew of risks lying in that direction. So those are longer term structural stories that we think are going to be ups and downs, but we have reasonably high confidence will continue to be things that play out over the coming months. The second thing I would say is that broad macro backdrop on our baseline forecast is still fairly friendly for risk markets. We're pricing things well. There's less room than there was, but it's still a reasonably benign story, given that you're not going to trigger that recession fear along that track. We've said, and we think there's still value in diversifying U.S. equity holdings, probably more value than there has been at some point in the past. They underperformed in the first quarter, they outperformed in the second quarter. And we've said that non-U.S. investors should think about hedging their currency exposure on their U.S. equities, but there are still unique exposures in the U.S. market, particularly around AI, that people are going to be enthusiastic to have. And so it's not a case of backing away from U.S. equities at all. And I think it's just that broad equity story still looks like it has some support from the macro. The third, which we just talked about, is that big tail risk is around recession for me. So I think if the unemployment rate ticks up, that's the thing you need to worry about. It's a tail, but that's the tail that you need to worry about. I think to extent, shorter dated bonds, but bonds in general should be somewhat protective of that risk. But that's an area where people need to feel like they're at least aware of the risk they're taking and the portfolio is structured in a way that makes them comfortable with that. And I think the final one, which is a sort of newer thing, is that we have seen more of these episodes of sort of less common institutional concerns around fiscal sustainability, around monetary independence, things like that, where we've seen dollar weakness, bond weakness, equity weakness together. That hasn't been a long lasting theme, but I do think, again, those are deeper tail risks, but having some awareness of the possibility, that possibility is a higher possibility than you would normally say. And so when you look at the book that you have, the portfolio that you have, just to be comfortable that you're not taking too much cumulative exposure to something jointly like that happening, which is not something we've seen as much of over the prior years. So a lot to focus on. There's always a lot to focus on. I always enjoy these conversations. Thank you so much, Jan and Dom, and I would say good luck to investors out there. Thank you again, Jan and Dom, for joining us. Thanks for having me. Yeah, thank you. This episode was recorded on Thursday, July 17th. I'm Alison Nathan, thanks for listening.

I'm Alison Nathan and I'm here with George Lee, the co-head of our Goldman Sachs Global Institute. Together, we're co-hosting a series of episodes exploring the rise of AI and everything it could mean for companies, investors, and economies. George, good to see you again. Great to be here, Alison. George, I'm very excited for this conversation because today we're going to discuss one of the biggest questions about the rise of AI. Where will the power come from? We know that it consumes enormous amounts of power. That's come up in a lot of our conversations. And in the first episode of the series, I think you said it may be one of the biggest constraints to the growth and development of AI. So let's dig deeper into that. Tell us why that is. There's a temptation to think about AI as this sort of ephemeral phenomenon, the great chatbot in the sky. The reality is this is one of the most physical technology infrastructures ever built. Vast data centers filled with racks of servers and GPUs and other gear. All of that gear requires enormous amount of power and at a scale and density that probably has never been seen in the history of computation before. That coming at the same time of a bunch of other emergent power needs in the world has really made power kind of perhaps the most binding constraint or bottleneck on the delivery of the promises of AI. And probably more interesting, it brings together two very orthogonal populations in our commercial ecosystem, hyperscalers and the fastest moving, most innovative technology companies in the world and highly regulated utilities. And our guest, Rebecca Kruger, stands at the very nexus of those two populations. So it'll be fascinating to have this discussion with her. So let's bring Rebecca into the conversation. Rebecca is a partner in our natural resources group within our investment banking division, which just published a report entitled Powering the AI Era. Rebecca, welcome. Thank you. Thrilled to be here. So Rebecca, in your job, you are talking to leaders in this space, corporate leaders in the space all the time. How is AI dominating those conversations at this point? It's been top of the list to say that AI and the associated power demand has been a focus for our clients is a true understatement. And by the way, the CEOs and the boards of our biggest power companies, they will tell you both privately and publicly, the power demand that they're seeing is unprecedented. And there's no playbook for this. But to understand why that is, because it seems pretty simple, right? AI data centers are getting built, let's just build some power plants. It's actually not that simple. There's a lot that's going into it. So just to set the table for a second, how did we get here? So the last 20 years in the U.S., power demand has been flat. And that's despite a growing economy, despite growing population. We all have more devices that we're plugging in. But offsetting all of that has been offshoring. So we've been shutting down a lot of manufacturing plants in the U.S. That's obviously changing as we try and reshore a lot of manufacturing capacity. And then number two, appliances just got a lot more efficient. And so during those 20 years of when electricity demand was totally flat, a lot of things calcified on that assumption. It was taken for granted that would always be the case. And so energy policy, for example, started to prioritize low emission sources of generation. That's a really good thing. Decarbonizing our economy is a great thing to do. However, intermittent emission-free generation sources like wind and solar are not available all the time. And we're not quite there yet on technology of long duration storage. And so as a result of energy policy, which has really been prioritizing decarbonization, our grid has been getting less reliable. Fewer power plants that can operate 24-7, which is what data centers obviously need. And more power sources that are what we call intermittent. Even before the AI demand story started taking off, participants in the industry were already getting nervous about reliability of the grid. And EV charging was viewed as the straw that was going to break the camel's back because of all the electricity demands that was going to bring. And the grid just wasn't ready. The AI demand story is just a step change in the amount of demand. And so we can get into it in more detail. But the process of getting more megawatts or more power plants online and serving this load is a really complicated issue. And the infrastructure, by the way, is quite old at this point as well. Yeah, that's right. Not only are our power plants in the U.S. quite old, the grid, the actual wires that get electrons from where they're produced to where they're consumed, is on average 40 plus years old and not getting any younger. And the permitting to build new transmission lines is quite time consuming. So how are companies going to meet this increased demand? What is the plan? So like everything in energy land, there is no one size fits all solution. And so we've seen some really interesting partnerships pop up between tech companies and power companies to get more megawatts or more power plants online. So let me give you some examples of that. There are nuclear plants, which amazingly enough, were totally uneconomic and out of the money just a few years ago. They were highly subsidized a couple of years ago. Nuclear plants are exactly what data centers need. It's clean, firm power, 24-7 power. And so we're seeing the hyperscalers partner with some of the owners of these nuclear plants to bring some of them back online. Three Mile Island was a recent headline there. Another option at nuclear sites is there's usually excess land there. And so there's something called up rates. So building more megawatts at an existing nuclear site. So those are some of the low hanging fruit in the sector. You can probably count on one or two hands the number of opportunities that I just described that are out there. There's a lot happening on new construction, but there is a timing mismatch. It takes one to two years to get one of these data centers online. It can take, and I hate to say it, five, ten years plus to get some of this power generation online. The current administration's doing a lot to try and speed that up, the permitting and the siting and all of that. And they're having some success in that, which is great. But it's not just that. It's the supply chain to build out some of these assets is quite backed up. A gas combustion turbine to build a new gas fire power plant, they're sold out until 2030. And so that is what's driving the bottleneck when we say that power is the biggest constraint on data center build out. Fascinating. Let's double click on that, that sort of cadence mismatch between the fast moving hyperscalers, people who want to produce this AI computation, and the way that utilities are run, governed, and are subject to the gravity of those very real supply chain constraints. How do you see them navigating that mismatch culturally and temporally? It's been so interesting. So George, you hit this in the intro, which is these two industries, which historically have not had to really interact or work together in a major way. They have two completely different approaches to how they attack their problems. One is move fast and break things. The other is do no harm. And I operate under a 30 year planning cycle. And my only job is to deliver safe and affordable power. But it's been really fascinating watching these two industries come together to solve each other's problems. And so we can talk more about some of the partnerships that we're seeing there. But the other really exciting thing that's happening is during those 20 years of flat power demand, there wasn't a lot of price signals or incentives for anyone really to invest in R&D, to develop new technologies, or to rethink how we produce and consume energy in this country. That's changing really rapidly. And some of the biggest proponents and funders of it are the hyperscalers. And so one of the examples that I think is most exciting is this concept called peak shaving or making load more flexible. And the grid in the U.S. is built for peak demand. So that one hour in August in Texas when everyone's got their AC on, that peak demand is what the grid is built for because the ACs need to go on, the lights need to go on when people flip the switch. But for so much of the year, there's a lot of unused capacity. And so on the one hand, there's headlines out there saying like, all the lights are going to go out because AI is going to gobble up all the power. It's much more nuanced because there are all these unused megawatts that don't get used for most of the year. And so some of these new technologies or innovations are going to help data centers become flexible demand centers. Yeah. And we've done a lot of work together on this topic. And it implies not only changes in demand management on your side of the equation, but for the hyperscalers and producers of AI computation, re-instrumenting their algorithms to be able to deal with that intermittency. And we think there's a lot we I think mutually believe there's a lot of headroom there for sure. Yeah. The other thing that's very differentiated between the two populations of companies is the quantum of capital available and the way they think about it. These are expensive projects. Talk about how the two populations are coming together to find joint solutions to capital numbers that would have seemed unimaginable years ago to your clients. Well, and these capital projects a few years ago, these numbers would have been unimaginable, but we're talking overall projects, the data center plus the power into the tens of billions of dollars. And what's so fascinating about it is power is just a small fraction of the overall cost of the data center build out talking maybe 10% of the total cost. But as people who follow the power sector know, the average size of a power company is a small fraction of the size of hyperscalers. And so there's definitely a difference in terms of size and amount of resources. But in some ways, it's a great fit. It's like these two puzzle pieces coming together where they both want the infrastructure built. The power companies ultimately want to own it and operate it. It's what they're great at. It's what they're here to do. They have stretch balance sheets, right? These projects and the amount of power they're being asked to build, in some cases doubling what they currently have operating. That's mind blowing, right? When you think about the fact that it took each of these power companies or utilities, 50, 100 years to build up what they have today, they're being asked to double that in the next 10 years. So it's stunning when you think about it. On the other hand, the hyperscalers, they have vast financial resources. And so there's a lot of interesting negotiations and partnerships being discussed and negotiated real time on how can the hyperscalers use their balance sheets and their financial resources to help get some of these assets built. Do we have a generation problem or a transmission problem or both? Yes. Right. I thought that might be the answer. Yeah. I mean, power is a very local or regional industry. It's largely consumed close to where it's produced because there's a lot of what we call line loss as you transmit electrons from where it's generated to where it's ultimately used. And so, number one, the concept of siting the user of electricity close to the power plant, it's just more efficient. And in fact, you're seeing what we call more behind the meter generation solutions. So data centers literally siting behind the fence, their data centers right next door to the power plant, right? So we're seeing some of that. That said, we also have some generation assets in pockets of the country that are underutilized today. And so to the extent we can build some new lines to get those electrons from where they're currently underutilized to some load center, that can also help in a really big way. Because again, I said it earlier, there's no one size fits all solution here. It's going to be both more megawatts and more transmission. So you talked about behind the meter, inside the fence scenarios. You also illustrated the challenge of asking companies that have been around for 100 years to double their capacity in a matter of years. To what extent do the big tech companies and hyperscalers take matters into their own hands and vertically integrate and build capacity themselves co-located with big facilities, particularly in an era where we may see, hopefully see things like small modular nuclear or nuclear fusion. Do you think that'll ensue? So it's possible. It's been interesting watching the journey on the tech side as they started getting very smart. And this is not recent, this has been a journey they've been on for many years. But they've reached a point where they are so sophisticated on energy and they are very effective advocates in D.C. on energy policy because, you know, as mentioned, it's their biggest bottleneck. And so they care about the policy that's coming out in D.C. To date, we have not seen the hyperscalers leaning in to own outright the generation assets that I think they would tell you it's just not their core business. The power companies, that is their core business. And so why mix that up? That said, this is all moving so quickly. And so if they form the point of view, that would be a more efficient, faster path to getting the power. Maybe. Right. I think a lot of things are on the table. I think longer term, you mentioned SMRs, so small modular reactors, which is an emerging technology of nuclear plants. There is a vision. And so SMRs are around 350 megawatts, which is a good size, you know, an appropriate size for medium, small sized data centers. But they certainly can be stacked for larger data centers. There's a vision in the technology sector that maybe just maybe as the SMR technology advances, it can be part of the modular construction design for a data center. So a data center has the shell, the SMR, the chips, and you're good to go. Right. So that's some vision for the future. Whether we get there or whether the power companies continue to own the assets, time will tell. Is there any concern that we are going to be so focused on build that we're eventually going to overbuild in a sense? I mean, when we think about, there's some concern that data centers might get overbuilt. So it's a great question. And what I'll, you know, the history of the power sector, there have been many booms and busts, and there's been a lot of capital and money lost on overbuild cycles, companies have gone bankrupt. And so what was so interesting about the last call it 18 months, I actually think the power sector was the last group of folks to believe in this demand story, because I think they had PTSD from the last boom and bust cycles. And so that's shaping the power companies approach to this build out in some really important ways. Data centers and the life cycle of a chip is four years, would you say, George? That's a matter of debate. And it's somewhere between three to six years. Yeah. Okay. Probably on the shorter end, in my view. Right. And so therein lies the challenge, right, which is these, the power plants and transmission lines, these are 30 year assets. And so the last thing a power company wants to do is build this capacity solely for this customer, and then be left holding the bag when four years from now, the data center is obsolete, right, or not in use anymore. And so it's leading to contracts that we're seeing being struck between the power companies and the hyperscalers on certainly minimum tenors and return on and of capital during the contract tenor. And so the power companies feel good that their investments are being protected. And the hyperscalers are getting what they need in terms of the power. And as you turn up the dial on the power price, what does that do to the overall hyperscalers return on the data center complex? It's not much of a needle mover, because it's such a small input on the overall cost. And so I mentioned before that it's like these two puzzle pieces that fit really well together. Power companies are very price sensitive. I think a hyperscaler would never tell you they're price insensitive, but they have a little bit more flexibility in terms of what they're able to pay and the terms that they're able to agree to. So interesting. So we've talked about the supply chain constraints to building out this infrastructure. Are there other constraints that we should be focused on, regulatory constraints or something else that we're missing here that's going to make this even more challenging? So there's a couple, all solvable ultimately, but craft labor is one. And so there's a lot of talk of new nuclear getting built. The last nuclear plant that got built in the U.S. at its peak had north of 10,000 workers on site. There's talk of, you know, we are entering the next nuclear renaissance. You can only imagine how many workers just to build out those nuclear plants are going to be required. But even putting nuclear to the side, building out transmission lines, building out gas fire generation, we expect a real effort and advocacy effort from D.C. on pointing people, workers back towards these trades because it's critically important. We are short on labor. And then policy, to your point, and we've seen President Trump his first day in office declared a national energy emergency. And so there's been a flurry of executive orders and pushes on policy to streamline permitting, to try and clear the way for new nuclear to get built. And there's many others that have been happening as this administration tries to get more firm baseload power built onto the grid. So what does this all add up to in terms of deal flow in the sector? Yeah, so it's been very, very active, both in terms of M&A and strategic financing. And so on the M&A side, because megawatts and the overall power infrastructure complex is becoming such a more valuable and scarce asset, we're seeing a lot of consolidation. This year alone, we've seen $30 billion acquisition of a large gas fire power portfolio. We've seen a $12 billion acquisition of something similar. So a lot of consolidation happening there. And then in terms of strategic financing, there's a lot of pockets of private capital that are trying to invest to help fund the build out of all of this infrastructure. So we're sitting right in the middle of all of that, trying to match the capital with where it's needed so that this power can get built as efficiently as possible. Interesting. I mean, as I'm listening to all of this, I think there's just a bigger question here, which is AI going to really drive a transformational shift in the U.S. power grid and landscape, even the global power grid and landscape. Do you see a reshaping of the power landscape off the back of all this? I think a couple comments there. Number one, the U.S. power sector was already under investing, and there were some reliability concerns that were coming. And so this huge demand story is putting everything front and center all at once. And it's forcing policymakers and every other stakeholder in this big puzzle to focus on these problems and solve them. So that's a good thing. That's a really good thing. And you've got stakeholders across the board on both sides of the table who have deep pockets and deep financial resources throwing their resources at this problem. So that's a good thing for the country, because at the end of the day, reliable, affordable power is a good thing for us as a country. I do expect more innovation. Carbon capture, for example, is getting a lot more focus and investment than it was previously. And so that's basically take your gas-fired power plants, put carbon capture and sequestration equipment on it, and it lowers the overall emissions of that power plant. That's a great thing, right? And it's a win-win because the hyperscalers ultimately who will be offtakers there, they do care about the emission content of their power. Maybe the last thing I'd say on this is I think fundamentally how we can produce and consume energy in this country is going to be changing. Over the last 20 years, when we had flat demand growth, there wasn't the price signals that really triggered and motivated innovation. We are seeing that in spades today, and it's a really exciting time as a result. So interesting. Thanks again for joining us, Rebecca. Thanks for having me. This was terrific. Great discussion as anticipated. And I want to feature the thing that Rebecca ended with, which I think there is an optimistic frame. There are real challenges here. You have regulated utilities who own fealty and obligation to rate payers. There's a lot of concern about continuity and price of electrons for them. This is clearly a generational challenge to meet this need. And yet you are interposing a set of entities that are the most innovative, tech-forward entities in the world. They now can turn their attention to bringing more efficiency, more change, more new ideas to this older ecosystem. And I think it promises the potential, as your question signaled, for a very high rate of change in this kind of slow-moving ecosystem in the next five to 10 years. Frankly, we'll need it. Absolutely. Couldn't agree more. I mean, bringing innovation to this sector, you know, it's got to be a win-win. But to their credit, and as Rebecca mentioned, really responding, partnering well with these companies, this is not a population of companies who are burying their head in the sand. Like, they recognize the opportunity, the need, and I think they're really rising to meet the challenge. Pretty inspiring, actually. Absolutely. Well, thanks again, George.

Across all countries and particularly developed markets, populations are getting old. So what will global aging mean for our economic future? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I'm sitting down with my colleague, Kevin Daly, co-head of the economics team covering Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa within global macro research. Kevin, welcome back to Exchanges. Thank you very much, Alison. Good to see you. Kevin, you've done a lot of work around your Path to 2075 series, looking at what the global economy could look like in 50 years from now. And you recently released a report about global aging. It's no secret that the global population is aging. But first, give us the facts behind that. What measure do you look at to determine this? And what does it show? I mean, Alison, however you measure it, the global population is aging. So if you look at median ages in developed economies, 50 years ago, the median age was 30. Now it's 43. Over the next 50 years, that's expected to rise to 47. For emerging economies, they're significantly younger. But the median age there has also risen from 19 to 30 currently and is projected to rise to 40 over the next 50 years. The other way that economists like to look at it is to look at developments in the working age ratio. So what is the share of the population that is between the ages of 15 to 64? For developed economies, that peaked just before the turn of the century around 67 percent. It's currently at 63 percent and is projected over the next 50 years to fall to 57 percent. So however you cut it, the global population is aging. So what's driving that process of population aging? So I mean, there's two developments is increased longevity and declining fertility. I mean, on increased longevity, life expectancy has risen in what demographers call the longevity frontier. So this is the country with the highest longevity in the world. And it's in 100 years ago, that was Australia. And the life expectancy was 63 in 50 years ago that that country was Iceland with a life expectancy of 75. Currently, the country with the highest life expectancy in the world is Hong Kong with 86 years. If you look at that trend over time, that's, you know, rising very steadily and for 150 years has been rising steadily at a rate of about a quarter of a year every year. If you look at the global economy as a whole, actually, it's been rising even faster than that because there's been some convergence to the frontier. So countries with the lowest life expectancies have seen the biggest increases. So on average, it's risen by about a third of a year every year. Now that's so that's longevity is is is helping is contributing population aging. The other factor, as I said, is is fertility. So fertility has fallen pretty significantly globally. It peaked at five point four in in 1963. So that's total factor total fertility per per woman and has now fallen to two point one with in developed economies. It's actually significantly lower than that at one point five and emerging economies. It's at two point two. So let's take those in turn. I mean, first of all, longevity isn't a good thing that we are living longer. I mean, we're all striving to live longer. I mean, in some ways, that is, you know, the product of innovation and technological advancement and everything else is is to be able to live longer. No, I mean, it is. I mean, it's a very basic point, but it's a very good one. And it's one that I think a lot of economists often miss is that the fact that we're living longer and not only longer, but also healthier lives is is a fantastic testament to the the scientific progress that we have made over the last couple of centuries. And as I say, it's not just that we're living longer, we're also living healthier lives as well. There was a very comprehensive study done by the IMF recently published, which looked at 50 year olds over the last quarter of a century. And it found that on average, somebody who's 70 today has the same cognitive abilities as somebody who was 53 in the year 2000, 25 years ago. When you look at physical abilities, somebody who is 70 today has the same physical abilities as somebody who was 56 in the year 2000. In a very real and tangible sense, 70 is the new 53. So this is, you know, a fantastic benefit for us. That's really striking, actually, even in the year 2000, which is, you know, very fresh in our memories that we have had such a big improvement. Very interesting. It's, I mean, it's remarkable. I mean, if you look at, you know, people are sometimes surprised that but if you look at, you know, TV shows from the 1980s, from the 1990s, you look at some of these actors, or even sports stars from that period, and you take pictures of these people and go, you know, that actor was in his 30s when he was doing that role as an, and often these people are people who today would pass for somebody, you know, in their 40s or their 50s. So it is, you know, however you measure it, both physically, both mentally, how people look, there has been a, you know, we are living significantly longer and healthier lives. And so we are seeing a big rise in life expectancy. We are, and actually the official data, I think, are understating the true increase in life expectancy, because the life expectancy data that are commonly quoted, are actually not really a measure of life expectancy in a true sense, they're a measure of what are the age of people dying at today. So when we say in an average developed economy, life expectancy is 82 years old, what we're saying, in effect, is that somebody born 82 years, years ago in the 1940s would live to 82. Now, the measure, the official life expectancy in the 1940s was actually in the, you know, 61, 62. So if somebody born today, their true life expectancy is only 82, if we assume that there isn't some improvement in mortality rates and longevity rates over the coming 82 years. And in that context, Kevin, when you say mortality rates, how do you define that? So, I mean, mortality rates can be defined many different ways, but it is the average number of people in a population, and often that's defined on a specific age category. So how many 20-year-olds are dying, how many 30-year-olds are dying in any specific year. And what we're seeing, what is driving the increases in life expectancy is that there's been reduced numbers of deaths or mortalities for every age group going up until now into the 80s and 90s. And so the assumption that mortality rates will remain constant is not bearing out. You're actually seeing mortality rates less death. Not only is it not bearing out now, but I mean, it hasn't borne out for the past 150 years. Let's talk about the other factor you mentioned, declining fertility. How worried should we be about that? No, I mean, it's clear that, you know, this isn't an unambiguous positive in the way that, you know, increased longevity will be. But, you know, I'm long enough in this business to remember, you know, until a few years ago is that people were really worried about exploding population growth and, you know, very excessively rapid population growth. You know, and we have to remind ourselves that even with the falls in fertility, we have had is that the global population is still projected to continue to rise. So the UN on its latest projections expect global populations rise from 8 billion currently to 10 billion in 50 years. So to peak around 2075 and to gradually decline thereafter. They previously projected it would rise to 11 billion by the end of the century and be continuing to rise. So the projected peak in population has declined, but we're still seeing, you know, quite significant population growth over time. I think one of the other factors that gives rise to some confusion over this is that the magic number of 2.1 of the replacement rate. So this is the rate that demographers typically think of, you know, if fertility falls below 2.1, the global, you know, the population in a country or the globally will fall. And importantly, we're at that 2.1 percent threshold globally. But actually, that 2.1 percent figure isn't set in stone. It's only that is only the replacement rate that stabilizes the population. If you have mortality fixed at current levels, if you have life expectancy increasing over time, that replacement rate is significantly lower around 1.5, 1.6. So actually, we're still at a global, at a global level, at a level of fertility that implies increased population growth over time. So if I'm putting this all together, population aging is a consequence, as you said, of increased longevity and declining fertility. Those are the two major factors. But if we think about population aging itself, how big of a problem is that really? I mean, it is a problem. And the reason why economists fret about it so much is because if you have a fall in the share of the population that is of working age, and if that follows, you know, one for one to a decline in employment rates, and that will reduce employment in populations, will reduce GDP, and will increase dependency ratios, so that the number of dependents in the population dependent on those who are in employment. So if we go back to those figures that we quoted at the start of the podcast, the working age ratio in developed economies falling from 67 at a peak and just before 2000 to 57, that's a 15% decline. You know, if it is matched one for one for a fall in employment, that will reduce employment and GDP by a similar amount. The only solution really in the long term to that increased longevity, increased aging is for us also to work longer. I mean, other factors may provide temporary fixes, but the only long term solution is that if we're living longer, we also have to extend our working lives as well. So do we see any evidence of that's actually happening at this point? Are we working longer as we're getting healthier and staying healthier for longer? We are. That's a good news story to this as well is that, you know, this is a problem if we weren't also working longer. But the good news is that we are also working longer. So, you know, from 2000 in developed economies, longevity is increased on average from 78 years to 82 years. That's a 5% increase in longevity, whereas effective working lives. So the amount that, you know, that we're using data that we ourselves have calculated have actually increased by 12% of that period from 34 to 38. So much as economists treat the working age ratio as being from 15 to 64, the reality is that people typically don't enter the workplace at 15 because they're in education and they, in many cases, don't leave at the age of 64. And what we're seeing is in their effective work lives, the number of years they actually work, they have increased significantly since 2000. By the way, I'm not sure everyone would agree that's good news, Kevin. I think we do aspire to not be working for a very lengthy amount of time in our lives and have some enjoyment at the end there. But if you think about, you know, why people are working longer, have you done any work in terms of why that is? Yeah, well, I mean, it's good news in the sense that in the sense that it's an adjustment we have already made. We're already well in the process to making. So it's not an adjustment we have yet to make. And if you look at the factors that have caused the increase in effective working lives, I think they are predominantly good factors or positive factors. So one has been an increase in female participation after childbirth. So there's been a significant increase in women extending their working lives, particularly through improvements in childcare provision and so forth, being able to continue in the workforce after they have started having children. And then the second key factor has been the reduced importance of manual labor. So manual labor is, you know, we think of things like construction, but also manufacturing jobs, a lot of, you know, a lot of manufacturing jobs in particular. These are tough jobs that people typically retire from relatively early, as you've seen a reduced share of the workforce in manual jobs. You're seeing an increase in the effective working hours as a result of that, as more and more people are doing office type jobs. And so, Kevin, we began talking about this, you know, the underlying concern is that we're in this so-called demographic time bomb, and that's going to ultimately have negative consequences for economic growth. But what I'm hearing from you is perhaps you don't need to be as concerned about the implications on growth from all of this. I agree. I think one of the factors that contributes to these concerns is that people find it difficult to separate the process of getting older, which we all face, which is inherently worrying, with the process of economic aging, which is actually less of a concern for society as a whole. Economic transitions are always difficult, but this is one that we're managing relatively well. Are there specific investment implications of the work you've done? I think there are. I mean, so a lot of the analysis on aging and the implications of aging makes the, in my mind, mistaken assumption that, you know, as our lives increase, we can hold everything else fixed. And so what that implies in practice is that, you know, we're, you know, extending the amount of our lives that we are in quote-unquote old age. I don't think that's an accurate description. As the IMF worked, I mentioned earlier on highlights. Actually, a more accurate description is that we're extending each of the parts of our lives. So we're younger for longer, we're middle-aged for longer, we're older for longer. And so one implication of that is that there's not naturally going to be a shift from aging necessarily into increased demand for goods and services that quote-unquote old people desire, because we're extending all stages of our lives in proportion. Interesting. I think there's a lot of food for thought there, Kevin. Thank you for joining us and sharing your insights. Really interesting work you're doing. Thank you, Alison.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-07-01 20:27:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Commodities Outlook: What’s Driving Oil, Gold, and Base Metals\n**Episode ID:** 4484\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nGeopolitical tensions, trade policies, and a slowing economy are driving significant volatility across gold, oil, and other commodities. So what's the outlook from here? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. For today's episode, I'm speaking with my colleague in Goldman Sachs research, Dan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research and head of oil research, to talk about how recent events, notably the Middle East conflict and evolving tariff policies, are affecting the broader commodity and economic landscape. Dan, welcome back to the program. Thanks, Alison. So let's start with oil. I think the obvious place to start, oil prices have been very volatile amid these recent developments in the Middle East, but I think what's most striking to me is how quickly they actually retreated from the recent highs, and they're still at lower levels than I think many people would have expected given the recent developments. So why is this? Yeah, absolutely. So we estimate that the geopolitical risk premium in oil spiked to over $15 per barrel on Sunday night, just a week ago, and then 24 hours later, it was just worth only a couple of dollars per barrel, based on the fact that oil prices were nearly back to pre-escalation levels. And also, if you look at options markets, if you look at options markets and look at the probability of large supply disruptions, it's pretty low, as estimated by options markets, below 4% or so. And the question is, why is that? The first reason is that oil traders have now experienced several episodes with major geopolitical shocks, but actually no disruptions to oil flows, with barrels still flowing. I think the second reason is that Iran's response was quite muted. Both the U.S. and Qatar got a heads up, and there were no damages. Third, I think both the U.S. and China have very big incentives to make sure that oil flows continue, in particular to the Strait of Hormuz. And President Trump, with his great focus on energy affordability, in particular, is super focused on preventing those disruptions. And then last but not least, I think a lot of traders are reluctant to position for sharp price upside, as they share a view that the markets will start to see large inventory builds from the fall onwards. Right. So, a lot of forces working in the opposite direction. But just to be clear, if we were to see an escalation of tensions, what would the upside look like? Yeah. So, I mean, the last few weeks are a reminder that geopolitics can cause potentially very significant price upside if we were to see actual disruptions. To be clear, our base case assumes no disruptions. But we estimate that crude could spike above $90 per barrel if Iran's supply were to drop sharply. And in an extreme tail scenario where the Strait of Hormuz were to be disrupted on a sustained basis, oil prices could spike above $110 per barrel. To be clear, we think these are tail scenarios. But yeah, the geopolitical situation is currently not necessarily, you know, in a stable equilibrium, so we'll keep watching the geopolitical risks. Right. So, that is the upside tail, upside in terms of prices, maybe downside in terms of the global economy. So, beyond that really extreme scenario, do you see any lasting consequences from what has ultimately been this 12-day war in terms of the commodity markets? I think it was definitely scary for investors and policymakers going through it. At some point, if you looked at the polymarket prediction market, the probability of a disruption of the Strait of Hormuz spiked to 60% at some point. And I do think that policymakers, especially in China, will likely double down on diversifying their supply of energy. In practice, that means continue to invest in power, electrifying the economy, coal as well. Basically, boost the supply of everything that you have at home. China continues to import about two-thirds of its oil consumption from the rest of the world, and about 50% of its imports are coming from the Strait. So, I think this is going to strengthen this key trend of diversifying away from foreign oil and gas imports for the Chinese economy, which is bearish oil and gas, but bullish for copper and some of the other green metals. And in general, if you think about the prospect of a big disruption, are you seeing oil producers broadly looking to increase supply so we're not as vulnerable? We've already seen that trend, have we not? What are you observing in terms of the oil supply trends amid these types of developments? Yeah, so the main reason we look for oil prices to drop by another $10 per barrel over the next year is that we expect strong supply growth. In fact, we expect global supply this year to grow four times more quickly than demand, assuming no disruptions, with strong supply growth basically from two buckets of countries, the OPEC Plus producers that are unwinding their voluntary production cuts, and then what we call non-OPEC ex-US shale countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Kazakhstan, that are actually raising production by a million barrels per day between August and last month. So, very rapid supply increases there. And then there's actually, I think, upside risk to our forecast that US shale supply will decline modestly, or basically looks for declines because we look for lower prices. But the recent spike, I think, has allowed many producers to sell forward their production at a higher price to hedge price risk. And when we speak to some of the producers, they are a little bit less pessimistic about the oil price outlook from their perspective than, for instance, in early April. And in fact, we got an all-time high for US crude supply released earlier today for the month of April. So, I think this reinforces our view that supply growth will be strong and will push down oil prices, assuming you get no geopolitical supply disruption. I was just going to ask you about that, because relative to the last decade, oil prices aren't particularly high right now. But producers, you're saying, are somewhat optimistic. They've hedged at slightly higher prices. And so, ultimately, this price is economic to motivate the supply growth you're seeing. Yes. So, we expect supply growth globally this year to be driven by so-called long-cycle producers that have very low variable costs, in contrast to US shale, where the variable costs are quite high and where we look for modest declines, perhaps with the risk of flat production, based on the recently stronger numbers. But big picture, the last 10 years have been an era where US shale has driven 100% of global supply growth. And I think our forecast is that 2025 and 2026 are going to be a partial, but only very partial, reversal of that trend, with US shale supply declining modestly because we expect lower prices, and with countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE regaining market share. So, supply substantially outpacing demand. But let's talk a little bit more about demand, because one of the other striking aspects of the last few weeks has been the incredible heat wave that we've been experiencing here in the US, as well as in Europe. What are the implications of that on demand? Yes. So, the heat waves we are experiencing in the US, in Europe, and now in China are bullish for energy prices, both because it means higher cooling demand via AC, and because you could also potentially disrupt supply of some of the oil refined products, for instance. It can be tough for refineries to run well with those very hot temperatures. We think that the most significant upside is in power prices, including summer peak power prices in the US, and to a lesser extent, it could also be positive for natural gas prices or coal prices, and to a lesser extent, fuel oil, which is the part of the oil barrel that is used for cooling. We do think that US summer power markets are getting very tight, and following the blackout we saw in late April in Spain, we do think that some of the tighter US power markets, for instance, the mid-Atlantic PGM market, is at a significant risk of power price spikes and perhaps even outages. The reason is that power demand is now growing quickly, more quickly than GDP, in sharp contrast with the last two decades. Data centers are part of that, and on the supply side, most of the supply growth is really coming from weather-dependent supply, such as solar and wind, and we're also having a lot of coal retirements being scheduled. So, in other words, the summer power market is getting critically tight, and we do think that outages are a significant risk. Interesting. I mean, and we think about beyond these weather-related risks, I mean, we're entering the summer travel season here in the US in particular. How does that impact demand? I mean, again, it's interesting to me that demand is, you know, falling so far behind supply. Yeah. So, seasonally, oil demand is going to be strong in July and August. Those tend to be the strongest months, both because of cooling demands and because of travel demands. But taking, you know, taking a step back from the seasonals, I would characterize oil demand growth as pretty modest, modest compared to history, and modest compared to strong demand growth foreseeing some of the other commodities like copper. So, specifically, we expect global oil demand to grow by 600 kbd this year, you know, that is 0.6% of the overall market. Contrast that with the 4 to 5% demand growth foreseeing global power markets. Compare it with copper demand in China, that's up 25% year-to-date, with surges in solar installations and electrification supporting demand. So, I think divergence is kind of the key theme that we're seeing, especially within China commodity markets, but more broadly, you know, on the demand side across commodities. But economic growth, it's slowing, as I said at the beginning, but it's still holding up relatively well. So, why are we seeing such subdued growth for oil? Is it just becoming less energy-intensive growth? Yes. Traditionally, you know, GDP growth was maybe, you know, 1.5 percentage points faster than oil demand growth as, for instance, vehicles became more fuel-efficient. But we do think that oil demand in China has peaked. China oil demand used to grow by 500, 600 kbd in the five years before the pandemic, but the very rapid shifting out of gasoline and diesel into electric-powered cars, into LNG-powered trucks, and now even into electric trucks, you know, is causing China oil demand to stagnate and is now causing a wider gap between GDP growth and global oil demand growth. Perhaps the new normal for that gap is around 2.5 percentage points or so. Interesting. Let's pivot a little bit and talk about the other commodity that's gotten a lot of attention, been a big outperformer this year, gold. Transactions have recently consolidated, but gold prices are still up 25% year-to-date. Are you still bullish gold? And if so, why? Is this a cyclical story? It's a structural story. What's driving the bullishness? Yeah, we're still bullish. We still expect the gold price to rise to $4,000 per troy ounce. So that's another 20% of upside for here. The main reason is really structurally higher demand from central banks. Central bank buying of gold has increased fivefold since 22, when Russia's central bank's reserves got frozen. And we just got the survey a couple of months ago, surveying more than 70 central banks across the world. And the survey showed record high purchase intentions with no central bank that was surveyed indicating that, you know, that they would reduce their gold holdings over the next 12 months. So interesting. So it's central banks diversifying, and they're diversifying out of the dollar, right? Or where are they diversifying from? Dollar-based assets? Yes, primarily. Yeah. I mean, and that's interesting because, you know, if we think about a structurally weaker dollar and lower interest rates ahead, which I think is the consensus expectations and certainly our expectations, particularly on the dollar side, you know, what does that mean for commodities demand for gold, but even beyond? Yes, I think the big potential winner from further dollar diversification is gold. More broadly, I think the industrial metals could benefit from lower rates and a weaker dollar. On gold specifically, the almost doubling in prices since 22 has really been driven by central banks diversifying out of the dollar. But the next giant leap for gold markets could be if private investors, who often feel like that they're overallocated to the dollar, may reallocate, you know, to some extent out of dollar holdings into gold. And that could be the next giant leap for gold markets because the gold market is 200 times smaller than the US S&P 500, is 100 times smaller than the US treasury market. So you only need like a very small shift of flows into the much smaller gold market to cause very significant gold price upsides. More broadly, I think to know which commodity would benefit from lower rates and a weaker dollar, I think you have to think about the drivers. Are you in a risk-off environment where the dollar and rates are weakening because market participants are worried about US recession or about US fiscal sustainability? Then I think gold is your winner. If you're more in a risk-on environment where the dollar is perhaps weakening because of European stimulus or perhaps because you see a dovish pivot in the Fed reaction function, then we find typically that industrial metals such as copper and ally are the biggest winners. Interesting. Okay. Lots to think about there. The other big wild cards, of course, out there right now are trade uncertainty and fiscal uncertainty. We are still facing this looming July 9th tariff deadline. There's been a lot of back and forth about what will happen before or even after that date. So how are tariffs reshaping the commodities landscape? Where do you stand now in terms of their impact on prices ahead? Yes. I think I want to distinguish between the macro impact from higher tariffs on other things than commodities, for instance, the reciprocal tariffs, on GDP, commodity demand and commodity prices, and then the impact of tariffs on metals specifically. So far, I think the macro impact via weaker GDP of tariffs is still not very large based on what we can see, still manageable, perhaps because financial conditions have weathered the tariff imposition well, perhaps because trade policy uncertainty measures are normalizing, but perhaps because it's still too early to see the full effect. I think there has been a lot of front-loading that may have postponed the hit from tariffs to GDP growth and therefore commodity demand. What is already very clear, though, is the impact of the tariffs on metals, on metals markets. In particular, we have a 50% tariff on steel, a 50% tariff on aluminum imports, and we expect a 25% tariff on copper markets. So far, we are seeing pretty significant price increases for U.S. Steel and U.S. Alley. So these tariffs are leading to significantly higher prices. And we do think that the possibility of a 25% tariff, perhaps a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports is providing opportunities for investors, because what traders are now trying to do is they're trying to get the metal shipped into the U.S. before the potential deadline, and that's leading to very significant tightness in the rest of the world. Inventory levels in places like China and the world, excluding the U.S., have fallen to only 10 days' worth of consumption. So that's putting a lot of upward pressure on prices outside of the U.S. And so we do think that the threat of tariffs on copper is causing price upside both in the U.S. mechanically, because people will have to pay for the tariff, but also outside of the U.S. Right. But that's a pretty temporary phenomenon. You'd expect that eventually to play out. That's right. That's right. And if we think about the other major development that I mentioned, the fiscal deficits, both in the U.S. and then in Europe, as we see this increase in defense spending, maybe a welcome increase, what are the implications of that for commodities? Yeah, it may sound like a broken record, but again, metals feel like the winners of these meta trends as opposed to energy. On fiscal specifically, if markets were to become more concerned again about U.S. fiscal sustainability, perhaps if the big beautiful bill gets approved, we think gold would be the winner. What we have seen over the last few months is a very positive correlation between a long day that U.S. yields, the 30-year treasury yield on the one hand, and the gold price. So periods when the market gets worried about U.S. sustainability are periods where rates go up and the gold price rises. On defense specifically, the industrial metals should benefit. The data are a little hard to get, but a report from the Defense Department showed that about 5% of U.S. copper demand is driven by the defense industry, so a sizable share, and 13% of nickel demand. So we do think that the industrial metals, especially nickel, are well positioned to benefit from a structurally higher level of defense spending. How much of that, though, is already priced in? I mean, we've been talking about this for a while, so you'd imagine that traders are in a good position for this to some extent already. Yes, although commodities tend to be more spot assets and less forward-looking than equities and also second, these are pretty long-lasting trends. I think the main takeaway from the NATO summit in The Hague last week was that, yes, Europe plans to go to 3.5%, perhaps even 5% of defense spending as a share of GDP, but it will take a while. So, Dan, putting this all together, how would you think about the relative upside of various commodities heading into the second half of the year? We see the most upside for gold and for U.S. copper, and see the most downside for oil. We see the most upside for gold because of structurally higher central bank demand for gold, and it's also a great hedge against several of the key risks, including tariff escalation or concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability. We also see significant upside to U.S. copper prices because the copper market is currently pricing only a 15% tariff on U.S. copper imports, and our base case is 25%, with risk skewed towards a 50% tariff on copper. Finally, we see the most downside to oil prices, base case another $10 per barrel lower over the next 12 months because of very strong supply growth, and it could go even lower if OPEC were to raise production more than our base case. I have to say it again, it is so striking to me that given everything that has evolved with the Middle East, that oil has the least upside here, but you make a very convincing case.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-06-23 21:59:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Mid-year outlook: diversify and hedge\n**Episode ID:** 4485\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWhat will the second half of the year bring for markets, and how should investors position now? I'm Alyssa Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. I'm joined once again by Christian Mueller-Glissman, who heads asset allocation research in Goldman Sachs Research, and by Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-chief investment officer of the multi-asset solutions business in Goldman Sachs asset management. For a change, I am in London this week, and Christian and I are both in the London office, and Alexandra is joining from our New York studio. This has become a biannual event, and I'm looking forward to our conversation. Yeah, great to have you in London. Thanks so much for having us. So let's get started. Christian and Alexandra, when we last spoke in January, you both emphasized that investors should really be thinking about diversifying away from the mega-cap U.S. tech companies that everyone was so focused on into different stocks, different assets, even different geographies, and that's turned out to be a pretty good strategy if you look back to the first half of the year, but there's been a lot of unexpected shifts in terms of U.S. policy, in terms of the economy, and given those unexpected shifts, what has surprised you most about the market reaction to them? Christian, maybe you can kick us off. Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right. There's two value adds that we can bring as asset allocators to the portfolio, either market timing or diversification, and I think diversification has worked really, really well, as you said, but market timing was very tough, and what really surprised me is the speed of some of those moves. I think we clearly have seen surprising policy shifts. There's no doubt about that. We even have geopolitical risks that have entered the picture in the last few days and weeks, but I think really the speed of some of the moves we've seen have been absolutely mind-boggling in terms of like the VIX kind of spiking, equities correcting very sharply, and it's just a reflection of this very unprecedented type tariff shock that we saw. So that surprised a bit. I think the direction, I think we don't disagree, I think was very clear that it's negative, but then you could also argue, wait a second, we still have the tariff uncertainty shock, and markets are back to the all-time high. So there's a surprise in terms of both how far we and how fast we've come down, but also how fast we've recovered. Alexandra, do you agree? Yeah, I think to your earlier point, both Christian and I were not surprised by the volatility, just given that there was such a high level of execution risk around the economic policy by the administration, but what's really surprised us has been this rare convergence of structural, geopolitical, and macro tailwinds that have driven ultimately some of the market behavior that one wouldn't expect in a drawdown. So the two places I would draw attention to are the safe haven status of the US dollar, in particular how it's not performed with its rate beta or the level of rate divergence across the globe, and the second was how boon market actually performed as a safe haven status. And just given the level of yields and lack of liquidity, the fact that it trades 10% of what the US treasury market does, we would say that that's unsustainable, but nevertheless quite noteworthy and interesting. I mean, in general, we have had a year where equities, dollar, and bonds sold off together, which as you just noted, Alexandra, that's very unusual. I mean, Christian, do you have thoughts about that convergence as well in terms of these moves? Yeah, I think certainly we've seen periods where equities and bonds have sold off together, like 2022, and coming into the year, we did highlight that equity bond correlations are not back to the negative levels that we have been accustomed to pre-COVID, and we did highlight, you want to think about broader safe haven diversifications. We had obviously some early fiscal concerns. We had periods of bear steepening in the yield curve, so we knew that we are not completely at equilibrium with regards to longer-dated bond yields. But what is a new factor, as Alexandra mentioned, is of course the way the dollar is behaving. And I think it puts into focus really a major portfolio construction problem that I think we've already had on the table before Liberation Day, which is US asset dominance in portfolios. I mean, this whole idea of diversification coming into the year was not necessarily motivated by the dollar, but the dollar puts even more pressure with regards to rethinking US asset dominance in investors' minds. So the way I think about it is the following. If you think about the portfolio risk contribution of FX in a global multi-asset portfolio, which essentially is for a European investor, for example, like in the last few years, that would have been pretty small. You would look at single-digit-type contributions to portfolio risk coming from FX, and that's gone up to 20%, 25%. So nearly a quarter of European investors' risk is driven by FX right now in a multi-asset portfolio. And I think that the reasons for that are exactly what you mentioned, two things. The dollar has obviously been more volatile and has shifted quite sharply, but in particular in risk-off, so it has become more correlated with equities. And that needs to be hedged and be thought about because you could argue a lot of investors are not being paid to take that FX risk and are not feeling comfortable with that. They're trying to harvest risk premia in the traditional asset classes. And to your question on what has driven that, it's very much related to a combination of policies that make people rethink their allocations to the U.S. So there's a capital flow dynamic. There is a lot of, how to say, uncertainty with regards to stagflation risk coming from the tariffs. And there's an element of the fiscal risk, where I think we have the big, beautiful bill that's looking to kind of pass through the House and Senate. And the market is quite worried about what that actually means for stagflation risk, for the supply of bonds, et cetera. So Alexander, if you think about these different factors that Christian just laid out, we are in tariff limbo. We have fiscal legislation running through Congress now that investors are generally concerned about. Ultimately, how is that impacting how you're viewing the macro backdrop at this point? So our expectation is that the economy is going to cool without contracting. And in fact, we've seen actually somewhat of a Goldilocks scenario recently, where you have GDP forecasts moving upwards and inflation data coming through much cooler than anyone had anticipated. And, you know, against that backdrop, we do expect the Fed to stay on hold and to really adopt a wait and see approach, which is appropriate in our minds, just given that we're operating in these 90-day increments with very fluid policy. You know, but it's actually been quite resilient. And one of the great debates in the market has been, you know, who's going to win between, you know, soft data and hard data. And in fact, with the marginal piece of information, you're starting to see sentiment and soft data come and hard data actually, you know, pretty much proving resilient. Yes, there's some cracks under the hood, but, you know, pretty robust still considering all of the different factors that you mentioned. So, you know, a cooler economy, but one that that's still chugging along. And so, Christian, if you think about the forward from here, we've talked about the fact that U.S. stocks, you know, tremendous volatility to the downside, tremendous volatility to the upside. So what does the opportunity set look like if we have a cooling economy? You know, what does that opportunity set look like at this point? Because, by the way, also valuations are still quite elevated, you know, in, you know, in the aftermath of all of this volatility. Yeah, no, I think exactly right. It's a tougher climb from here because on the recovery from the liberation kind of drawdown, you had sentiment and positioning being very low. Our risk appetite indicator fell to the minus two level, the very famous level, which gives you a signal that you might be oversold. And you had a bit of relief on the valuation question. Exactly right. I mean, coming into the year, we were kind of as in recent years, we were a bit worried about valuations and market concentration on the most highly valued stocks, the Magnificent Seven. We discussed that last time. And you had a bit of relief there. You remember, like you had the deep seek related drawdown, which led to a bit of valuation relief and then obviously the liberation day. But all of those issues are a bit back on the table. I mean, in May, the Magnificent Seven have led the market higher. And to be fair, driven by fundamentals, I think that good earnings and I think they still keep delivering. So in summary, to answer your question, the business cycle is getting a bit more challenging. I think we're dealing with slowing growth with possibly a bit of upward pressure of inflation. I wouldn't call it stagflation. It's more stagflationary momentum, as Alexander said, from a relatively good level of growth relative to inflation. I think we had a bit of this inverse Goldilocks scenario. I agree on that. So you're moderating that. And and I think so the opportunities will be linked to exposure in areas that are not exposed to that. And sadly, you could argue the Magnificent Seven are kind of one of those areas. So it's not completely irrational that the market maybe goes a bit towards those areas. They have structural growth. They have delivered good momentum on their corporate fundamentals. And you might remember we discussed this before, but ROE, return on equity, is one of the most important variables we're watching for the S&P 500. And and most of the ROE is driven by the Magnificent Seven, especially the high levels. And every month this year, the ROE has actually ticked up on the S&P 500. And that supports, especially for these highly valued, highly profitable companies, the current valuations. And as long as they keep that momentum, I think that that can be parts of the opportunity. But obviously everything in the ecosystem that is more structural growth that's not exposed to the business cycle, I think that will definitely be one part of the opportunity in the second half. And the second part is probably to be a bit more defensive. So we've been quite focused at low volatility, like low volatility stocks, which is like a defensive strategy, can be a very good way to moderate risk while staying invested and essentially also free up risk budget to maybe own some of these more convex but more volatile parts of the market, like tech and the Magnificent Seven. So to some extent, the opportunity, if you want to sum it up in one word, is again diversification in the second half, maybe other places, maybe more opportunities, trying to reduce the cyclical beta and trying to kind of find opportunities that are a bit more structural and possibly a bit more carry as well. Like if you don't expect a recession, if you don't expect a severe slowdown, which I think the market certainly is moving towards, and I think our economic view is also not expecting a recession as a baseline. We've reduced our recession probability to 30 percent at this point, so marginally above the unconditional probability. With all of that in mind, there is also the potential to look for selective carry strategies. So Mag Seven, defensive. Alexandra, where do you stand on that question? Yeah, I think that we would characterize the opportunity as being more selective optimism rather than broad bullishness, very similar to what Christian is speaking to. And the recovery, it's getting mature. So a lot of the different variables that one would look at in terms of positioning and technicals, et cetera, the stars have already aligned there. I think in line with guidance, we're going to continue to see more divergence and dispersion across names and sectors. And so it's an opportunity very ripe for active management. And we think that you can stay invested with prudent defense, similar to what Christian highlighted there, but that it is really important to keep an eye on long-term innovation trends and places where you truly believe that the growth trajectory will materialize. And so Christian mentioned that given the policy uncertainty in the U.S., investors are reassessing their global allocations, potentially away from the U.S. What are you observing, Alexandra, in terms of thinking about other developed markets versus the U.S. at this point? What are you seeing? I think against the backdrop of divergence and desynchronization and more just broader tensions in the geopolitical landscape, diversification is really important. And that's one of the things that we highlighted at the beginning of the year, and that the opportunity set is really different based on where central banks are, levels of interest rates, but equally some regionalized, localized things that are happening. And so when we're thinking about, we've talked a lot about public markets in this dialogue, but when we're looking at some of the private spaces where there's less competition, smaller pools of capital in places outside of the U.S., we're seeing that as a potential alpha driver. There's different dynamics, whether it's relating to urbanization and real estate and all of these different places where you can have really good underwriting. And ultimately, despite what's happening in the bigger macro picture, you can really find some opportunities to put some profits in P&L on single names and then broader sectors. So we're very focused on, yes, diversification is really important regionally, but equally across both the public and the private spectrum. And Christian, would you agree with that? I mean, what are you observing? And there's been a lot of focus on Europe and some of the positive themes that are running through the European economy at this point on the fiscal side, on the remilitarization side. Should we buy into that theme? Yeah, I think the way I think about it is a bit like what Alexandra said. You have to work a bit harder now. And we're seeing certain constraints coming from our cycle position, which is somewhat late cycle. Unemployment rates are low. Profit margins are high. Risk premia are compressed. Alpha gets more important. You look at all kinds of opportunities that become a bit more specific. And I think we've looked at Europe. Definitely the European fiscal infrastructure spend is a very interesting anchor. And that anchor is, in my opinion, as of now, in a lot of conversations, much more about lowering left hand risk than generating right hand risk. So people are not necessarily buying yet into this opportunity that Europe might outgrow or outperform kind of U.S. equities or U.S. assets. But there is an openness to say that the downside tales are different compared to the last cycle, where you went into negative rates, where we were fighting deflation. And I think that is worth something. That is worth something with regards to valuations and risk premium and might justify a bit of narrowing of risk premium. So we have these discussions that feeds into opportunities like European banks. European banks have been very badly hit by negative rates. They've been very badly hit by the last cycle of deleveraging and relatively poor growth in Europe. But they are now actually looking better. They have been increasing profitability. There is restructuring. There is consolidation. There's possibly a bit of deregulation. And obviously, there's a positive linkage to higher rates. And if you get steeper yield curves globally, like banks are a bit like a hedge. And there's liquidity. And I think the big challenge when we speak to investors about international diversification is to some extent the size and the liquidity of the U.S. in the benchmarks, in the global opportunity set. And European banks are one of the more liquid parts of the European equity index. You've got some companies that are above 100 billion market cap. So I think we definitely see people being selective, opportunities related to fiscal infrastructure, related to banks, possibly still defense in Europe. And I think we have also more focus on emerging markets and I think the opportunities that you might get over there. I mean, my key takeaway so far from this conversation is diversification still a key theme for the remainder of the year. But has anything shifted, Alexandra, about how you will think investors should be approaching long term asset allocation given all of this policy uncertainty right now? I think one of the core tenants of a successful investment process is one that is not constantly changing, but one that is constantly being re-underwritten and evolving with real structural changes. And we have long believed in alternative risk premia. We think it provides uncorrelated returns to portfolio. It gives you, on the defensive side, proper tail risk hedging. But there is no silver bullet as it relates to the tail risk hedging. And we saw rates didn't provide that ballast, as we mentioned, nor did the dollar. It's more of a constellation of strategies coming together. And so we're actively in the lab really thinking through what is that proper constellation. And we mentioned the divergence or dispersion amongst single names in this kind of backdrop. And so we think adding something like that to portfolios, these left tail strategies, you have a cost to them, but you can structure them appropriately so that you can still stay invested. In fact, you can collect more risk premia or invest more in risk assets while having some of these tail risk hedging strategies in the portfolio. So yes, it's diversification, but it's also acknowledging some of the changes in the backdrop and making sure that you have the right construct of things coming together for your total portfolio. When we think about everything that's going on right now with the bond market, how does that influence how you're thinking about the role of bonds within a portfolio at this point? I mean, it's definitely a rethink where in the last 20 years or 35 years, if you like, bonds were a positive carry instrument that was risk reducing. And now we have to rethink that. There might be a period where bonds are actually repricing to an equilibrium of higher bond yields, which means that their returns might be actually lower compared to the yields that are currently standing on the tin as such. And the equity bond correlation is more positive. So there's an evolution that needs to happen in multi-asset portfolios because of that. And you look at alternative diversifiers both across and within asset classes. So that means that you need to find alternative safety, which might include assets like gold that have been negatively correlated with the dollar, but also in risk off have been uncorrelated. They actually haven't gone up all the time in risk off in a big way. So they didn't give you the convexity that bonds sometimes gave you. But certainly they haven't gone down. And that helps. And they've been trending up. And you need to look at styles and factors that have the ability to be uncorrelated to both equities, bonds and the dollar. And I think I agree with Alexandra, like the tail risk hedging styles, the tail risk hedging factors, they obviously cost. You always need to balance the cost versus risk reduction trade off. And how much risk budget are you freeing up to actually earn back the carry that you might have to pay for some of those risk reduction strategies? That's not an easy one. But if you can find positive carry type diversifiers that might not be negatively correlated, that might not give you the upside convexity in risk off, but diversify, that can be very attractive. We've seen a lot of focus on commodity carry is a good example that has actually performed reasonably well this year, depending on the construction. But it has been interesting as a diversifier. So I think it all comes back to the evolution stepping a bit away from the benchmarks, I'm kind of not just saying you have a 60-40 portfolio and let's try to make it a bit better, but think very holistically about the dimensions of risk. So you have traditional asset class dimension, you have the macro risk dimension, you have the factor risk dimension, take a total portfolio approach and try to understand how each of those are interacting. And it's more like a mosaic. It's not like one solution, as Alexandra said, it's multiple things. And that's the beauty about multi-asset portfolio management. But also the sad thing, it used to be very easy to do well with a 60-40 portfolio. But now like multi-asset portfolio management needs to work harder, but it has all the tools and all the ability to actually do better than 60-40. So Alexandra, if you think about the opportunities and risks, what is your best advice for investing clients at this point? It would be embrace the positive and hedge the risks. We think that this summer there is a high probability that you're going to see more volatility just given liquidity dries up a bit. And so every marginal headline that we see is going to be exacerbated in terms of price action. But that being said, we're looking through to what the forward growth trajectory looks like, and we see many positive things in the horizon as it relates to 2026 and the high velocity nature of some of the tax policy changes and fiscal stimulus within Europe. And I think that investors should already start looking forward into what some of those positive catalysts will ultimately be for the next year, including the change in the Fed chair. And so along the lines with the market, it's time to continue to look forward to what the next six months will have. Christian, advice? Yeah, I mean, listen, we are relatively close to home in terms of our asset allocation. So we're relatively neutral on risk going into the summer. I agree there's a few catalysts we're worried about. There's the tariff deadline. There is French elections. There's obviously the Middle East conflict. I think the best approach is, as I mentioned, build a well-diversified portfolio that can deal with certain amounts of shocks and kind of stay invested, stay close to home, somewhat neutral. And one thing I would highlight is hedging. I think in line with the significant pickup in risk appetite and valuations, you've seen a significant decline in volatility. And that means that hedges are relatively cheap again. And I think especially for investors that are sensitive to volatility, because our baseline is probably not consistent with severe kind of bear market risk into the second half. But you could definitely see a difficult summer. Liquidity might exacerbate it, like the deadlines, the communication around policies might exacerbate it, considering where sentiment and valuations are. I think there's a really good case to think about hedging the summer kind of risks that you might have. So a lot to watch in the second half of this year and into 2026.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-06-18 22:56:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Is a US fiscal crisis ahead?\n**Episode ID:** 4486\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nIs America in fiscal trouble? Concerns about the U.S. deficit have surged, but worries about the fiscal situation of the United States are nothing new. So is this time really different? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month, I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top-of-mind report from Goldman Sachs Research. This month, I spoke with two people who have long worried about the U.S. fiscal trajectory economist Ken Rogoff, a professor at Harvard University, and historian Neil Ferguson of Stanford's Hoover Institution and Harvard's Belfer Center. Both agreed this time is different and are worried about the U.S. fiscal situation today. So I started by asking them why that is. Here's what Ken Rogoff had to say. I think the big change is that global long-term real interest rates have risen. In my opinion, they've normalized. The whole stuff about lower forever secular stagnation was always wildly overblown. And I've been debating this for over a decade, saying that if you look at the longer-term behavior of real interest rates, they go in cycles, but there's a lot of regression to mean and no one should have ever planned on there being low forever. So a lot of what you're calling fiscal concerns is a much broader movement towards higher interest rates that has to do with, well, certainly higher global debt is a piece of it, but I would also say global fragmentation, geopolitical uncertainty, the need to build energy to accommodate AI, re-militarization of the world and the costs of that. So I think long-term bond rates will continue to creep up, not go down. The whole idea that many people still have, that they're going to go back to the pre-pandemic levels, I think is dreaming. That's just not going to happen. And the rise in interest rates is affecting everything. It's not just public debt. It's affecting all markets, but particularly for countries that have gotten used to not just not paying down their debt, but running it up and up and up, particularly the United States, but pretty much everyone. But is this all about the rise in real interest rates or do we have deeper issues? We'd feel a lot better if rates were just lower. That's the biggest piece of it. But of course, in the United States, our debt is much higher now. There may be people who say it's irrelevant, but actually when you're a large debtor and interest rates go up a lot, it affects you a lot. So we're much more vulnerable to higher interest rates. And here's Neil Ferguson on why this time is different. I've been warning for 20 years that the United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path. And there are times when people like me have felt like the boy who cried wolf. But one of the lessons of history is that great power like the United States, which is the number one military power in the world, which has the privilege of issuing the reserve currency, which is issuing securities that are seen as risk-free, it can light a lot of matches in the dynamite room and get away with it. But at some point, the sentiment shifts, and I think we've seen a shift in sentiment this year, and it's been quite a dramatic one in the sense that investors, really since it was clear that President Trump was going to wage a much more aggressive trade war than in his first term, began not only to reduce their holdings of US treasuries, but also to move away from the dollar. So we had the very unusual shift of yield somewhat upwards on bonds and the dollar down. And you can see that although the debt relative to GDP, depending how you measure it, is roughly where it was after World War II, the really concerning thing is that we're spending more on interest payments on the debt than we're spending on defense. And if you spend more on interest payments than on defense, you probably won't be super and powerful for much longer. And that I called Ferguson's Law earlier this year. That's a kind of simple heuristic, but it seems to me is better than looking at debt to GDP. So that's the issue that I think we should focus on. The United States has, throughout its time as the dominant global superpower or empire or hegemon, you can call it what you like, had this ability to spend really quite large shares of gross domestic product on its military. But now the fiscal constraints are becoming meaningful. And here's the key point. If you just look out 10 or 20 years and make reasonable assumptions about growth and interest rates the way the Congressional Budget Office does, you've got to assume that with every passing year, the US is spending a little bit more on interest payments relative to defense until by about 2040 or maybe a little later than that. The interest burden is 2x the defense budget. That's the trajectory that we are on right now. So when and how would a crisis manifest? Here's Ken Rogoff's take. I would point to the old saying, Rudy Dornbusch said it very eloquently, but I think it goes back to Herbert Simon, which is financial crises take longer to happen than you think they should. And when they do, they unfold faster and harder than you think they could. And I think we're looking at some sort of endgame to this over the next few years. And so when you say we're nearing an end, are you basically saying that you think we're on the verge of a crisis, a debt crisis? How would you define that? Well, there are different kinds of crisis. I think in advanced countries, actually defaulting on debt is extremely unlikely. When it hits here, it can unfold in the form of inflation. It will happen in conjunction with a shock. I don't know where it'll come from, but there are certainly many kinds of shocks that would both hurt growth and raise inflation. And it's going to be more painful than the post-pandemic inflation because although everyone complained and it caused a lot of political problems, there was relatively minor adjustment in bond markets in terms of inflation expectations. Certainly the Michigan expectations adjusted a lot. Business inflation expectations adjusted less than consumer. But if you look at the bond markets and look at inflation premium, they're pretty small. When it happens again, there'll be a much bigger adjustment. I mean, I think the bond markets underrate the possibility of inflation at this point. Inflation repression is another mechanism for containing the interest rate rise by basically forcing people to hold more debt, which creates a larger part of demand. Japan has done that big time. Europe has done it a lot. You know, I don't know what form it will take. It will depend on the shock. It will depend on how the government reacts. But regardless, I don't think the current fiscal dynamics are sustainable. Neil Ferguson is focused on the geopolitical ramifications. Any power that pursues a fiscal policy that allows the cost of its debt to become double the cost of its armed services is clearly open to challenge. And it's time we face that and stop telling ourselves stories about the U.S. being number one and always being number one. I have looked at this as an historian, taking the story back really to the very origins of public debt itself. The Romans didn't have public debt. Public debt came around in the modern form in the Italian Renaissance and was first really a crucial part of a global power when 16th and 17th century Spain was running quite a complex system of long-term and short-term debt. And it crosses the Ferguson's law line, starts to spend more on interest payments than on defense in the 17th century. And pretty quickly, Spain finds itself facing multiple challenges to its empire, including from the Dutch Republic. The story repeats itself with the Dutch Republic in the 18th century. It also repeats itself with France, Ancien Régime France in the 18th century, which finds the cost of its debt is substantially more than it can spend on its navy, and therefore it suffers defeats at the hands of Britain. I could go on. It's the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. It's the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Finally in the late 20th century, it comes around and Britain succumbs to Ferguson's law and the United States is just the latest great power or empire to find itself in this fiscal jam. It can get out of it. There's no inexorable force that obliges us to keep increasing the debt and reducing the resources available for national security. We can fix this, but it calls for leadership and it calls for sacrifice. There are gonna have to be some things that we cannot do if we are to maintain our capacity to deter our enemies. And deterrence is really crucial here. The lesson of the 20th century is that deterrence is much, much more economically preferable to actually fighting a major war. If Britain had been able to deter Germany in 1914 and again in 1939, then Britain would not have ended up exhausted and declining in the later part of the 20th century. In the same way, if the U.S. fails to deter China, then it has a choice between a very big war or folding. That's not a great choice for the president of the United States to face. But the dollar's dominant global role has long underpinned arguments that the U.S. is less vulnerable to debt crises. So I asked both Rogoff and Ferguson if that provides any comfort today. Here's Ken's view. It gives us extra cushion, but we've used a lot of the cushion. Let's say foreigners hold maybe 25% to 30% of our debt. OK, so we can have 25% to 30% of GDP more debt, maybe even 50% more debt, but not 100% more, not something that goes on forever. And dollar dominance is going to be diminished. We lost a huge amount of market share in the global currency world during the 1970s. Don't think it can't happen. Since 2015, but really over the last few years, China's been moving pretty aggressively to move away from the dollar. I mean, it's really happened a lot the last few years. Asia is half the dollar block. And so it's part of our market. ICS is headed, at least in a decade or two, towards a world which is more tripolar with the dollar on top, but not colonizing as much of the world. The dollar never took back Europe. We had Europe after World War II. We never took it back after the fall of the Bretton Woods system. Europe went its own way. But while that was going on, India globalized, Latin America globalized, Africa sort of globalized, and the dollar was dominant in all those places. That's the market, and that market is going to shrink. The euro is going to take some of it, but much more the renminbi, because, I mean, African and Latin American countries don't trust the United States any more than they trust China. So I think we'll see moves in that direction. And it's not just about reserve holdings. It's not just about the denomination of trade. It's also about the global financial flows. So I don't see the dollar as being suddenly replaced by the renminbi. In fact, I don't know what world yet that's going to happen. But we are diminished, and it's not just the renminbi and the euro. It's also crypto. They're all causing the dollar to fray at the edges. And in addition to these external factors, there are these internal factors. And I think the debt problem, which I think will ultimately end up in another burst of inflation also will serve to undermine the dollar, lower confidence. That's what happened in the 70s. I also think Federal Reserve independence, which many people take a sacrosanct, is not. It's not in the Constitution. It could disappear in a week if Congress were supportive of it. We use sanctions a lot. That's absolutely incentivizing the Chinese. It's incentivizing the Europeans to break free. Neil Ferguson generally agrees. I think we shouldn't tell ourselves just so stories about the reserve currency status. The idea of exorbitant privilege, that was a French term used to characterize the dollar status in the 1960s, is a bit misleading. Because if there really was a tremendous privilege to being the issuer of the reserve currency, wouldn't US borrowing costs be really low? I mean, wouldn't the US have some kind of premium relative to less powerful countries that didn't have that privilege? But when you look at it, actually, US borrowing costs are above those of the European Union countries. And that's a little strange. So I think if one is really looking at this the right way, then the privilege of issuing the reserve currency has been somewhat eroded over time. Because frankly, the United States has exploited it to excess. We can't be complacent about dollar dominance when the only thing that's really stopping the Chinese currency being a proper challenger to the dollar is that the Chinese have capital controls. And as long as that's the case, people will prefer dollars to RMB on the whole. But the world today has other contenders besides the dollar. The euro, which some American economists thought would fail, didn't fail. And a lot of transactions and a lot of instruments are now in euros. So I think this story about the exorbitant privilege of the dollar has somewhat been overdone. And on close inspection, it's not as compelling as it might have been 50 years ago. So then what will it take to avoid a fiscal crisis? Rogoff believes voters hold the key. What we need to have is voters think that it's acceptable to bring down deficits. That's what we need. Right now, neither party can stay in power by trying to bring down deficits. And Ferguson sees a few ways out of the U.S. fiscal problem. There are potential ways out of these problems. If it's true that artificial intelligence is going to create a productivity boom by allowing all of us to do what we do much better and perhaps with fewer people, then the United States, which is certainly one of the leaders in AI, might get the kind of productivity benefit that Britain got from the Industrial Revolution. Another interesting argument is that the cost of defense may go down. The really super expensive hardware of the late 20th century, these precision missiles and the first generation of drones, that's all giving way to much cheaper stuff. Drone swarms are just cheap compared with aircraft carriers. And so one other solution to the problem is that we may be on the brink of a new revolution in military affairs that brings the cost of national security down. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that things can only get worse. And indeed, one of the lessons of history is you've got to be ready for discontinuities. The trend is often a delusion. We love drawing straight lines into the future. It's what economists excel at. We drew all kinds of lines prior to 2020 that got a huge kink in them when a huge pandemic swept the world. So I think we should always remember how nonlinear and surprising history is. And if any country is positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence and translate AI into greater efficiency, it ought to be the United States. I have been saying for years that the inefficiencies and excessive costs of the federal government mainly reflect the failure to implement technological solutions to problems like health care or collecting taxes. At some point, you might have thought we'd be incentivized to fix that. So I think there are ways out of this. The obstacles are not technological. The obstacles are political. It's a political economy problem that the two-party system produces budgets that never balance. That is bizarre when you consider the United States has been so successful economically in the last 20 years. It has clearly exceeded expectations in terms of growth. It's left the Europeans in the dust and the Chinese can't catch up. Why then are we running these deficits? That's the question future historians will ask. So Rogoff and Ferguson are worried about US fiscal sustainability and think the US may be headed for a crisis ahead. And my main takeaway, a crisis is not inevitable, but finding the political will to address the US fiscal problem may be difficult. So even if some people have long been warning about a crisis that is yet to come, this time really may be different. Let's leave it there. My thanks to Neil Ferguson and Ken Rogoff.

I'm Tony Pascarello, Global Head of Hedge Fund Coverage in Goldman Sachs' global banking and markets business. I recently had the great pleasure of sitting down with Steve Cohen, founder, CEO, and president of Point72. Steve is one of the world's greatest hedge fund managers, and he'd be on anyone's list of the most formidable traders of all time. We sat down in early June at Goldman Sachs' Apex Symposium, where Steve discussed his path to investing, the traits that led to his investing success, and his broader views on the markets and the hedge fund landscape. He also shared some insight on what it's been like since he became the majority owner of the New York Mets and his approach to leading the iconic franchise over the past five years. We hope you enjoy this conversation. Steve, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today. Happy to be here. Let's go back to the very beginning. I don't even remember it. So what was it that led you to a career in the markets? Yeah, I mean, my interest in the market started really young. Had a grandparents that used to talk about stocks they owned. And when I was 12, 13, I'd read the sports page, and then right the next page was the stock exchange listings. And so I was sort of math-oriented and just started looking at the prices. And then I started hanging out in a brokerage firm in my hometown. I actually found a job right next to the brokerage firm. So I can go in there. And I used to sit there with the old traders, and we just... I was 14 years old. Where was this? This was in my hometown, Great Neck. And it used to be like a show that, you know, before CNBC, and so I used to want to stay home from school and watch the tape. And so this was when I was 14, 15, 16. You know, maybe the grades suffered a little bit, but I learned to watch the tape. Now the world's different today, and you can't do that type of stuff. And essentially what it really was was pattern recognition. And I noticed things that I could actually start predicting what prices would be 10 minutes, an hour, two hours ahead of time based on the patterns on the tape. And at least, you know, a higher probability of getting it right. And so I was lucky enough to be hired by a local brokerage firm when I was 21 years old to do option arbitrage. But then I decided, why hedge if you're getting the pricing right? I was able to buy stocks, and I said, why am I hedging? Because I could sell it higher the next day. So at 21, 22, actually the firm allowed me to take risk without hedging. I would never, ever allow anybody in my firm at that age to do that. I mean, it's almost remarkable they allowed me to do this, but it gave me a great opportunity to demonstrate and develop my style. And it was new and different in the markets. And no one was really doing it that way. When I entered the hedge fund industry, it was more of a macro world with Soros and Steinhardt and Julian Robertson and all these great names. And I was doing it different. And after a while, people go, what is that guy doing? So kind of developed a new way of making money that maybe Wall Street hadn't seen before or hadn't seen much of. It just went from there. And in the time since then, you've seen a lot of traders come and go. You've seen a lot of money managers come and go. I've seen a lot of traders come. So what do you think are the traits that kind of correlate with those who have been successful? Well, first, you got to love it. I used to say I couldn't wait. I hated my weekends. I couldn't wait to get into work Monday because I just found the markets so dynamic and so exciting. And you got to listen. You got to have a process that you believe in, whatever it is, you got to have a core competency. And as long as you have that, a core competency, something you do well, keep doing it. And then you have to be adaptable. The markets change. I mean, most of the people I was either hired or competing against in the 90s are not in business today because they didn't adapt. They had one way of doing things. And so you got to be in a constant state of learning, evolving. You have to be highly adaptable. And if I wasn't flexible and adaptable, I'd be out of business today. So let's jump off that point. The hedge fund industry has evolved hugely since 1992 when you founded your firm. What's different about your approach today versus the early years? Well, I mean, the early years, there was so much more alpha 30 years ago. And I actually started the hedge fund right at the beginning of a big bull market. So it literally was an eight-year bull market, which was phenomenal. And so you had the wins behind you and there was just tons of alpha available. Now it's much more competitive. And we used to take so much risk, okay? I mean, almost remarkable when I look back at how much risk we took. But there was so much alpha out there. Even if you were wrong, you were able to make it up in other ways. And today we run completely differently. We're much more conservative. We run long, short, very tight. And the business is much more scalable for us. So I want to stick with the hedge fund industry for a moment. The multi-strat model has achieved a huge amount of prominence today. Why do you think that is? Well, I mean, God, we have scale. We can provide credible resources to our people. I mean, if you're a single manager, you got to market, you got to hire people. You're the one interviewing all these people. You probably have a very narrow specialty that if it's for some reason, not a moment where that strategy is working, what do you have to fall back on? We're very well diversified. We're diversified sector-wise, geographically-wise, strategy-wise. It's just, yeah, ultimately just a much better model as far as... So my people, my investing side can just focus on what they do best, which is on finding great ideas. They don't have to focus. And I do the marketing or obviously managing the firm, right? So 100% of their time is focused on creating alpha. Within your space, within the multi-manager neighborhood, it's super competitive. What does it take to win? Yeah, listen, I mean, my competitors are fierce and in a constant state of wanting to grow. And so the acquisition of talent has gotten really expensive, which means, you know, you got to find other ways to develop talent. We have many significant developmental programs, starting at the beginning when we hire people right out of school for what we call our academy. We get like 30, 40,000 applicants for 40 jobs. It's remarkable. So we're able to hire the best and brightest. And then once you're in the firm, education continues and evolves. You know, we're always trying to teach our people new things. We have PM and analyst programs, developmental programs. So basically an analyst can become a PM one day. I equate it to sports. I have a farm system versus you can go out and get free agents. Well, listen, I got one free agent last year, it wasn't cheap. And okay. And so it's, you know, if I could have developed that guy, it would have been a lot cheaper. So our goal is that, you know, and I think we do a lot better at developing talent. We have a higher hit rate as far as, because we know the people coming through our system, we know who they are, we know what they're capable of. When you're hiring somebody on the outside and it's usually competitive and it happens pretty quickly, you can make a mistake. Let's talk about market dynamics today. What do you make of the cycle and how do you feel about the opportunity set? Yeah. Listen, we're in those, we're all somewhat headline driven right now, which is a hard way to run money, but actually I think, you know, I'm talking about tariffs right now. I actually think it's kind of consolidating around a number. Most people think, and I agree with this, the average tariff will be in the 13, 15, 16% range. And what we do then is take those numbers and roll it into our economic forecast. And we expect slowing growth. And my economist thinks 45% chance of recession. I'm not sure if it's that high, but to me, recession, not recession, not really relevant. We're talking about decelerating growth over the next year. And even in 26, we only expect growth in say the 1.5% range. So in a world where multiples are high, I'm somewhat concerned on a short-term basis. That doesn't mean we have to go down a lot. I mean, we could be in a trading range. And when I look at a little bit, I think the offset is what's happening in AI and you can already start hearing about the margin benefits that companies are going to accrue from implementing these tools. And so I think that's what holds the markets together is the thought that margins will improve down the road for companies. Now, what it does for employment, what it does for white-collar employment will be interesting. And that may be a topic for another day as this develops. But from a company specific, if you're not implementing these tools now, you're falling behind. So my guess is that there's real benefits. This is a technology cycle that's probably going to be long-lasting, have duration and going to have a massive effect on how we live our lives today. Let's stick with AI for a moment. I'd be curious, how do you think about AI in the context of we're going to deploy capital? And then how do you think about it in terms of evolving your business? I mean, obviously there's lots of private companies that are being developed today. I mean, it's amazing. You hear about these companies that are ramping up revenues incredibly quick. Maybe a company would start and have 5, 10 million revenues in a year or two. Now you're talking about hundreds of millions. So clearly these companies are attacking problems that companies want to be involved with them as far as creating solutions to their problems. But you know, listen, you can express these bets in all the big name, right? All the obvious name. They're not expensive. They're going to be really major beneficiaries of their investments that they're making now and probably the winners, which if you play it out, is probably why the indexes are going to hold together. And have you seen any productivity enhancement within the operation of the farm in terms of the operating? I mean, you know, we're, I would call still nascent as far as in our investment side, we're embedding AI people within our units to watch, see how our people work and then try to develop tools that can help them become more efficient. That should be like the base case. Can we make our people more efficient? Can they do more higher valued judgment type thinking as opposed to manual work? And so lots of projects going on now and real participation from all our investment professionals. They understand this is going to really help them. So I think that's the base case. And then all the data that we produce in the firm, what can we do with it? And how do we use these tools to enhance our ability to create alpha? I mean, that's really the gravy, the Holy Grail, and that's sort of where we're highly focused also. So given everything we've discussed so far, you have a bunch of businesses within the firm. You have a fundamental long short business, a quant business, you have a macro business. How much does the calibration of your risk kind of change over time? And given what you just said about pushing chips firmly and kind of one of those businesses versus the other, not necessarily. Yeah, I think it's really hard to predict the future. So if you have three good businesses and call them three pillars of the firm, you kind of want to support them all. And they tend to kick in at different times. When macro is kicking in, maybe equities is having a tougher time. So there's a real nice balance there. And now I'm thinking about private credit as maybe a fourth pillar. I think there's a real opportunity there, a huge TAM and opportunities to track great talent that do a strategy that I think we can embed in the firm. I'm really excited about that possibility too. So let's spend a minute on that. It's a pretty different business in a way than a public business. Yes. So what drew you to it and how do you think about the risk management of it as distinct from your other businesses? Yeah, listen, I think the way you got to manage risk is you got to diversify over many types of strategies within the space. No different than what we do in our traditional fund. And everyone's talking about data center investing. Okay, well, if you put all your chips into that, and for some reason there's overbuilding, you're in trouble, right? But if you can spread bets over whether it's the consumer, corporate sector, maybe real estate, so you get the diversification. And then what I'm looking for are strategies that create extra alpha. So about a year ago, I sat next to you at Citi Field, and I'll tell a quick story. And you said, you know, I'm thinking about not trading a buck. And I said, I bet you a beer, you'll keep trading a buck. And you said, you're going to lose that beer. And about a week later, I lost that beer. You haven't paid the beer. I have. I owe you a beer. You owe me a beer. So you're no longer trading that buck. I'm not trading. What are you doing with the time that you got back? Well, actually, I mean, it's actually remarkable. I mean, my life is so much better. I mean, I basically had three jobs. I was trading, I was running Point72, and obviously heavily involved with the Mets. And so now freed up, obviously still the CEO of Point72, and obviously we're trying to grow the firm, and that takes up a lot of time. Then the Mets take up more time than I would have thought. But it's interesting, being involved with baseball actually makes me think about things that then I bring back into Point72. And so it's a great example of spreading your wings a little bit, getting involved in other things and realizing the skills that you developed in one place, you can bring other places. And that's very empowering. It's fun. So I'm kind of enjoying this whole new life, so new life. And as it relates to markets, I presume you still keep one eye on them? Yeah, I'm always looking at the markets. And I'm not as involved on the individual name level that I used to be, but I'm doing a lot more macro meetings and looking at things from top down. And so, you know, listen, I'm going to be 69 next week. And I started when I was 21. I mean, that's 47, 48, those are dog years, all right? And I actually think the firms benefited from now being freed up so I can get much deeper into firm issues and mentoring our PMs and helping them think about their businesses. So I always have a saying, nature pours a vacuum. You close one door, other doors open. So I'm having a blast doing it. And in your mind, do you think, probably go back at some point to trading? There's no shot. No shot. Okay. There is absolutely no shot. Okay. That's not going to happen. Okay. Okay. I mean... Double or nothing. No, no. Listen, I've been there, done that. And I'll say it again. The firm benefits so much more by me being free to have these conversations with our people and have impact on them. And I think that really matters. And so that's not going to happen. And in that context, do you find you have more, clearly more time to mentor and train and share your wisdom with your risk takers? A hundred percent. Okay. And help them think about their businesses. I mean, these are still young people and they really haven't managed people and really haven't built any. And just helping them think about why are they doing what they're doing? How are they making a decision? They're young. They haven't managed anybody before and they need help. And so I'm happy to provide it. I mean, everyone has constraints on how they think and, you know, what's possible. And if you can get them thinking in a sort of a more proactive, not aggressive, but because everyone around you is always going to hold you back and say, you know, you're doing great. You don't need to run more money. You're making a really good living. The reality is, if you're constrained by that, you don't know what's possible. I've seen people develop my firm and done some amazing things. If they, you know, had a mindset of being conservative and holding back on what they're capable of doing and they never would accomplish what they accomplished. And people get excited by that and they want to start thinking about what's possible. Let's go back to the mess for a minute. You mentioned in a way baseball has led you to certain thoughts or conclusions on the markets, on the hedge fund. How about kind of the opposite? In other words, when you first stepped in in 2020, what did you bring with you from the business world? Yeah. I mean, I took over an asset, you know, New York Mets that was under-invested in sort of old school and how they did things. And so I described my first year at the Mets as like, it's like a hazing. That was a hell of a first year and the team didn't play well too. Playing much, much better. We're playing much better. It's like trading. I presume owning a team has its kind of own unique sets of ups and downs at the long season. So what's been your favorite part and what's been the toughest part? Listen, without question, going through a pennant race last year was just incredible and how we were doing it was just remarkable. We were winning in the ninth inning. We were winning in incredible, extraordinary ways. I mean, we'll be in the playoffs a lot, I hope, but it will never, I don't think ever be quite like that month. And that month was remarkable. So I have never felt so alive in that month. I mean, the emotions that I was going through on a daily basis in those games were just something I probably never experienced. And then my daughter got married. She decides to set her wedding and it turned out that was the week of the World Series. And we were in the championship series. I'm like, gotta go to the wedding. So how am I going to do this? So we lost. I never had to deal with it, but I mean, it was pretty remarkable. I think the odds of us being in the World Series was like 2-3% at that point when we were losing earlier in the season. So that's the week she wanted it and thank God I didn't have to make that decision. Obviously, I would have been at the wedding. Let's stick with one more off the field question. You want to bring a casino to Queens? Yes, we do. Yes. Well, I call it the integrated resort. It's more than a casino. It's a 5,000-seat amphitheater bringing the best music acts. We're going to build a 25-acre park. We're going to build an area for Mets fans if they want to go to the hotel to eat and drink and enjoy themselves. And I mean, the biggest complaint from my fans is that they come to a game and there's nothing to do at the stadium. And I always kid because there's lots of chop shops around. I don't know if you've been to Citi Field. There's nothing around the stadium other than chop shops. So I always joke there's plenty to do. You can get your hubcap fixed. Maybe get your catalytic converter back that someone stole from you. So there's plenty to do there. But this is a real opportunity to transform the neighborhood and do something for Queens in a city that I think is nothing that anybody's done before. I'm pretty excited about the opportunity. We just got our land rezoned in the state legislature, so now it's just about winning the license. And we'll know probably by the end of the year, so I'm pretty hopeful. Point 72, the Mets, Metropolitan Park. When are you going to sleep? How's that going to work? Yeah, listen, I've got good people around me. I've actually had not had to spend a lot of time on the integrated resort. I've got a great staff around me led by Mike Sullivan, and they've handled a lot of this. So it's a perfect example when you have the right people around you. You can do a lot. You can scale a lot. And I'm lucky enough to have great people. Another good business lesson. Yeah, 100%. One last question. You've managed a lot of businesses, a lot of people. Yes. What's the one lesson that you've learned over the kind of arc of your career about managing all of that? Trying to figure out what's going on in people's minds is really tough. And what you think is going on is probably not what's going on. So I think you've got to ask and get them to talk. And you get them to talk, then you can help solve their problem. So I tend to think about running business and creating solutions. And if I can create solutions to their problems or their issues, I'm way ahead of the game. Thank you, Steve. That was masterful. Thank you.

A new government is in place, and Germany plans to dramatically increase its spending on defense. Meanwhile, U.S. tariffs could have a significant impact on the world's third-largest exporter. So what's ahead for Germany, and how are investors and business leaders making sense of this historic moment? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm sitting down with Wolfgang Fink, the head of Goldman Sachs' Germany and Austria businesses. Wolfgang, thanks for joining us today. Great to see you again, Alison. It's very nice to have you, actually, in New York the last time we did this. I think you were in Europe and I was here, so it's great to have you in person. So, Wolfgang, as I just said, our listeners may be aware that there is a new German government. It's been in place for a month or so. What has that meant for the business environment? Well, I think the government that is now in place and actively working is quite a change. They call themselves a working coalition, and they want to tackle many of the problems, some more structural long-term, some more short-term, that the country faces. Among them, importantly, the infrastructure of the country, and lots has been written about that. The defense, in light of the war we have in Europe, strengthen the defense capabilities of the country, and also Europe and NATO in particular, as to the European part. The other parts are clearly for a country to regain its competitiveness on the economic side, with many of the issues there, and European alignment. A big part is European alignment, making Germany strong again in Europe and a force for good in some country you can count on. And lastly, tackling some of the migration issues that have, as in so many countries in Europe, been on the forefront of many electoral campaigns. And that's another priority that they want to tackle swiftly. So then, in a nutshell, is the program. It's a massive program ahead of them, and they just started. Yes, I mean, we recently spoke with John Waldron, our president and COO, and he was pretty optimistic that we could be at a turning point when it comes to some of that spending. He made the point that there's a lot of fiscal room in Germany. It's been, you know, a standout in that sense, but there has been historically not that much willingness to use it. And if that's now changing, that could be quite important. So where does that really stand at this point? And, you know, is it something that could have really wide-ranging implications, as John thinks it might? Yeah, indeed, it will, because if you think about Germany, the GDP, the debt to GDP was still in a range that was quite, that offered the government quite a lot of flexibility compared to other industrialized countries. And so far, there has been a hesitation to use that headroom, if I may call it this way. Now they do that. They have changed legislation in order to be able to spend up to 500 billion in infrastructure, and also amended legislation in a way that they can go and do defense spending outside the constraints of the regular budget, which would hopefully allow them to get up to 3.5% of GDP in defense spending only by the end of the decade, so ramp it up slowly. But clearly, that will have an impact. In essence, it's a huge fiscal impulse that will come over the coming years. And we obviously have to see how that permeates into the economy and what kind of shape and concrete measures that will take. Clearly, the idea of a public-private partnership and sort of leveraging that amount with private capital is something we are closely watching and expecting to come as part of these measures as well. So that's that part. But then it also changes to increase the competitiveness on the company side, including taxes, including digital reform, i.e. to make the country more digital and allow that to happen. Germany has been a laggard in that regard. And tackling the key topic of bureaucracy that has been plaguing the country for many years now, in addition to the energy policy, which clearly is a big disadvantage in Europe, cost-wide, and in Germany in particular, for companies. And then lastly, but not least, obviously, the trade policy, which is front and center. So if you take all these measures, that's coming, and that will have a massive impact on the economy and hopefully also on the European economy as such. Right. So these are the positive developments in policy, tailwinds potentially for growth. But as you just mentioned, I mentioned, there is the tariff headwind that could potentially be coming. So how are leaders thinking about U.S. trade policy at this point and the uncertainty around it? Yeah, I think it has, as you say, it has a massive impact. So we shouldn't kid ourselves. The tariffs in the current form our economists think about hit the eurozone with between 0.5% and 1% of GDP. Germany clearly has been hit more than the average of the EU, given its propensity to export and to trade deficits, especially with the U.S. So it has a massive impact and it will be a drag to growth on the eurozone. Now, how is this happening? There's obviously discussions both on a supranational level with the EU, there are discussions on a national level, as we see every day. And then there is a discussion on a company level with the trading partner in the U.S. So you have various conversations going on at the same time. Clearly, the idea being finding a realignment. It's just too important as a matter and as business for both sides to not arrive at a conclusion there, we would hope. And it triggers lots of countermeasures from companies to deal with this situation. Most importantly, however, it triggers uncertainty and that uncertainty permeates through the economy and in particular affects the consumer. And that's what companies and the business in general are most worried about. How will the uncertainty play out in terms of demand and what does that do, apart from all the other issues? So we're in the middle of that discussion. It's fascinating to see it happening, but we would hope that we come to an alignment rather sooner than later. And if you think about how companies are actually responding to this on the ground, are you seeing shifts in supply chain? Are companies looking for new suppliers given this uncertainty you just mentioned? Definitely. So you see a lot of activity there, both on the supply chains. How do I adjust my supply chain and localize more? Is that even available? Do I have skill sets, capacities, logistics in place to do that? So that's a very active process. It goes further to factories. What's my planned layout worldwide? How do I optimize that? How do we create more local content, in particular in the U.S.? Obviously, negotiations are ongoing about quite substantial packages being sort of realignment of product and production. Obviously, also internal measures as to restructuring. You have to counter the current negative impulse. Think about all these cars sitting in some ports not being imported. Think about the question, how does the consumer get the product? How does the consumer react? And then the question of what do I offer in a particular geography? So which kind of product is still doable as opposed to not? If my engine comes out of the NAFTA, maybe I have still an advantage. If the engine is produced outside the NAFTA, the car is probably not saleable anymore from a price point. How do I adjust pricing models? So all these kind of adjustment processes are ongoing as we speak. And we hope, these companies hope to arrive at some equilibrium where actually an economic deal still can be made again. Otherwise, you'll face some short-term but hopefully not long-term disruptions and profit warnings and so on and so forth. And the disruptions might not just be on the manufacturing or production side. I mean, are companies looking for new customers, new markets in the face of this? Yeah, we've seen that as well. This process also started in China, by the way, as sort of governments and companies became aware of quite substantial dependence in many instances on the Chinese markets. Those efforts to diversify China plus one, finding additional kind of markets is underway. Now, it's not that easy because these markets aren't that sizeable compared to, let's say, for German companies in particular, China on the one hand and U.S. on the other hand. So India, for example, has been talked about a lot. It's not that easy, but it's happening. South America, the whole Southeast Asian markets. But clearly, it'll take a long time until you shift from what currently is China as a market and the U.S. in particular to diversify. We've seen it starting, but we haven't seen massive numbers yet. And you mentioned cars a couple of times. Obviously, Germany is well known for cars. But are there other sectors that are really in the crosshairs of these changes? Yeah, I think we have to say in particular machinery and equipment, industrial equipment, electricals on the one hand, chemicals, pharma in particular. If there were pharma specific tariffs, that would be a massive impact. Base materials like steel and aluminum and also, obviously, luxury goods and consumer goods out of Europe that are affected. But I'd say that part of what we are talking about are global shifts in traditional supply and demand patterns. When you look at some of the chemical inputs, there has been a constant shift to China as being the largest producer and market for those. When you look at some of the famous rare earth and these dependencies. So these discussions about how do we realign supply chains in a more fractured world and create more local for local have been ongoing for quite some time. I think the tariffs now highlight these tensions that have been existing in our global sort of distributed world that's now going more local, more local content again. Despite this trade uncertainty that we have been discussing will certainly impact Germany as well as other European economies, European equities and German equities in particular are up quite a bit, really benefiting from this theme of fading US exceptionalism. Europe and Germany in particular, again, seems pretty well placed to be a beneficiary of that. But from your seat, do you think that momentum is set to continue or is it a bit overdone at this point? I mean, at some point things get fully priced. Yes, I think that's a fair point. I think at the moment you see this shift, investors readjusting partly because of the returns in the US and in the US dollar haven't been as good or not set to be as good going forward as they have been in the past. So you saw some of that realignment clearly. And I think the US dollar plays a role there as well. Number one. Number two, it is to be seen whether that can be sustained. If you think about the German DAX, 20% of its sales are done in Germany. So in essence, you're buying a global index. And so you have probably a slight shift in the composition, but you're still depending a lot on the global economy and how it's doing. And depending on that, you'll see that whether this momentum sustains. European valuations have been more favorable or less pricey than the US one. So that gives you some headroom. I think we see that kind of slowly correcting and that would obviously then stop the movement at one point. And then you have to look at sectors. Clearly, defense, infrastructure, financials to some extent, tech have been sectors that have been somewhat insulated from what we just talked about and therefore have been sought after. Also there, we are arriving at pretty pricey valuations. Let's look at defense, for example. And I think something has to give. So we wouldn't see this a sustained momentum. It's something which has started. But then obviously, the company earnings and performance has to catch up with it. And that's what we are looking for when we look at the next quarters that the companies will publish. Right. So almost fully priced, we should say, in some of these sectors. Interesting. Let's talk about dealmaking activity. When you think about this trade uncertainty, bond yields are much higher in the US and beyond. You know, what has the impact been so far and what do you expect for the pipeline ahead? Yeah, it's actually very interesting. So you would think that this environment lends itself to a kind of no deal environment, given all the uncertainty. And you would ask which corporate leader would now take decisions, given that so many things are still up in the air and not nailed down. Having said that, we're actually seeing a quite good dealmaking environment. And we're seeing a lot of deals happening, though I would say in the category more mid-sized transactions rather than large-sized transactions, given some of what we just talked. And you have to look at the sectors again. I'd say that sectors are the ones we talked about are more sought after than the classic cyclicals and some of the ones heavily affected. That to me doesn't mean that companies aren't addressing issues and therefore going to market and trying to sell. But clearly, buyers look careful in terms of valuations. We talked about the price evaluation. So still not easy to get these deals done or make this math happen. But there's a good undercurrent of those type of deals in the sectors we talked about. So we're quite optimistic for the rest of the year. And clearly also the private equity business is going quite well. Companies have to come to market. Portfolios have to be sold. And that basically gives us a good underpinning for our general M&A activity. So I'd say we are cautiously optimistic with what we are seeing. And as the macro picture settles a bit more, we would expect this activity to pick up even more. When you think about the underlying catalyst for the pickup and activity, because as we just said, there's a lot of uncertainty, but I mean, why are companies re-engaging at this point? Is there just pent-up demand because there was a lull? How would you explain why now? I would think that there's a bit of pent-up demand also because we saw a slower environment last year. But then in general, very often the macro uncertainty we talked about is a catalyst for more fundamental change. Business and operating models have to be adapted. Restructuring finally have to be done. You basically try to pull the levers that you control in this environment because you know that what you can't control can have a massive impact. So you get prepared. I would say it's sometimes getting ahead of the curve of macro uncertainty by doing your homework. And then things have to happen. Now that means obviously that sellers have to accept sometimes prices they are not absolutely content with. But compared to what they are facing, that's probably the option they have. There are areas like technology where you would say they are somewhat insulated from what we talked about. The digitalization, implementation of AI, changing the go-to-market or the internal operations without an alternative. So they have to happen. So if you need a business or you need M&A to fulfill that objective, you got to do it, regardless of the macro uncertainty. So these sectors or we talked about defense or infrastructure, those things you can if you have an opportunity and you need to go for it. There aren't endless opportunities. So if one is presenting itself, you better be ready to take it. So what's your advice to companies and investors that are navigating this really uncertain moment? I would say the general economic underpinning is still strong. So stay close to your customers, make sure you're still in front of them with the best offering and ahead of your competition. The business is there, is out there. We talk about the probability of recession, but we don't see it yet materializing. So there's still good underpinning on the business side, number one. Number two, be prepared for a quiet, volatile, geo-economic environment. So stay nimble and flexible. I talked about ability to switch between plants, adjust supply chains. That's what you have to have in the scope of your daily judgments and decisions. And then lastly, pull the levers you haven't pulled before. Try to restructure where you can, look again at your operating and go-to-market models. Make sure digitalization is front of mind. Pull those levers that you haven't pulled so far in order to gain flexibility on the way. Thanks so much for joining us here in New York, Wolfgang, and sharing your insights. Thank you. My pleasure. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Tuesday, June 3rd. I'm Alison Nathan. Thanks for listening.
\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-06-05 13:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How Goldman Sachs’ John Waldron is navigating “a more uncertain time”\n**Episode ID:** 4489\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nThis may be one of the most difficult environments for corporate decision makers ever. So how are leaders navigating this uncertainty and are opportunities arising out of the volatility? I'm Allison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm sitting down with John Waldron, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs. He'll share how the firm's clients and Goldman Sachs are charting the path forward. John, welcome back to the program. Thank you, Allison, good to be here. So John, to say this year has been marked by uncertainty would be a huge understatement. So as we sit here today, what's your sense on where the economy is headed? So I think that we are seeing tremendous resilience in the U.S. economy, to start in the U.S. Lots of predictions about recession and negative economic scenarios right on the back of the liberation day in early April. And actually the data thus far has been pretty okay. So we've seen the economy kind of hang in there. The U.S. consumer is still essentially healthy and spending, employment is strong. There's a lot of fiscal impulse. So the government continues to spend, even though we talk a lot about doge and other elements of reduction and spend, the reality is the hard data shows you that the government continues to spend. So all those factors in the U.S. to me lead to still, I think, a likely scenario where we don't have a recession. The big question mark would be, to me, two pieces. One is tariffs. Where do tariffs ultimately end up? We've seen a journey from liberation day, a more maximalist approach to something now that at least looks more targeted. It's still a lot higher. If tariff rates end up at an effective rate of 13, 14, 15%, that's a lot higher than the 2% where we started. But nonetheless, I think it feels to me that we're heading towards something that's more manageable, that can be adjusted, you know, that companies can adjust to. And then the second big question mark in my mind, maybe the biggest question mark, at least in my view, is interest rates, particularly longer end interest rates. So we're seeing a lot of increase in duration in the rate curves in the United States, in Japan, and many other countries. And I think that could be a break on economic growth. So those, to me, are the two big unknowns. And I think we're going to learn a lot in the next few months in terms of how the data comes in as we see the factors of interest rates and tariffs become a little bit more pronounced. Let's dig into both of those a little bit. So if we start with tariffs and trade, obviously, as you just said, very much in focus. There's been another round of headlines about U.S.-China tensions. There's other developments even over this past weekend. You spent a lot of time meeting with clients around the world. How are CEOs thinking about global trade and all of this ever-changing tariff policy? And how is that really impacting how they're thinking about strategic investments? So the best way I can characterize this is I think about how we at Goldman Sachs have been spending our time advising our corporate clients, CEOs, CFOs, boards, you know, et cetera. And I think Liberation Day was a big shock to the system. It was very, very disruptive. I don't think anybody really in any board meeting ahead of Liberation Day thought it would go to that extreme. And from that point forward, for the next several weeks, there were many board meetings, many management meetings, of which we were fortunate to be a part of, that were reevaluating business plans. So you think about if you're running a company, you come into the year, like at Goldman Sachs, in my COO job, we have a business plan. We have a forecast. We are running towards a set of outcomes that we expect to deliver for the year. We don't have manufacturing facilities. We don't have a big supply chain. If you're running a company that has a big supply chain, you've made a certain set of assumptions about what your cost of goods sold are gonna be, how you're gonna run your operation that year to deliver those financial results. And on Liberation Day, everything changed. And so I would characterize a significant pause where most companies said, let's just take a step back. Let's first watch how this plays out. And then secondarily, let's start making contingency plans because if we see tariffs of that level in our supply chain, we will have to make some significant adjustments. The second thing is, to your question, no new capital investment plans of any consequence, particularly if they have any duration to them, which most do, because we don't yet know what the state of play is gonna be. And so let's kind of step back and not make any big strategic investments, capital, M&A, anything of consequence that would be a longer term oriented investment spend, we're gonna just take a step back. I think we're now coming a little bit out of the pause period where people think, okay, effective tariff rates somewhere between 10, 15%, maybe not much more than that. We can navigate around that if that's gonna be the new normal. And so I think we're seeing companies start to step out a little bit more and be willing to do some more things. We've seen actually some M&A over the last handful of weeks, not large industry defining M&A, but M&A nonetheless. And so I think the pause is ending and we're moving into now an adjustment phase. And you'll see, I think, some more decision making on capital spend, M&A transactions, capital return, stock buyback, et cetera, et cetera. So I think we're getting to a second order in the process of kind of redefining and re-underwriting what your business plan is gonna be for 2025 and beyond now that we have a little bit more of a sense for the direction of travel. If you think about this globally, are managements in different countries responding differently to some of these factors? I think the more U.S. dependent you are, the more pronounced your pause and your reevaluation becomes. And likewise, the more you're dependent on China for your sourcing and your supply chain, the more you're likely to be in a mode of pause. If you've already moved your supply chain to some of the countries that were less affected, you can be a little bit more forward. But one of the things I think is interesting is we've talked to a number of companies who had heretofore been much more China-sourced and over the first Trump administration moved their supply chain into places like Vietnam, Mexico, and otherwise because they were essentially following the direction of the U.S. policy, which was move away from China. They did so and then they look at the Liberation Day tariffs and they realize the tariffs are high in those countries, too. So I think that there's so much uncertainty in terms of the direction of the forward tariff rate and also what the supply chain is supposed to look like that I still think it's very unsettled in the context of making long-term decisions around supply chains. So I still think there's a lot more to come in that area. And as you said, the second major factor here weighing on the outlook is where bond yields go. A lot of fiscal concerns in the U.S. and in some other parts of the world as well. So talk to us a little bit more about that. How concerned are you? I'm concerned. I've said this publicly. I think a number of us at Goldman Sachs have said this publicly. Others have said it publicly. I think you run six-plus-percent deficits in relatively good economic times when you don't really need to stimulate to the same level. We're not leaving ourselves a lot of room if we, in fact, have a tougher economic backdrop. It seems unsustainable. There doesn't seem to be particular will in either political party to reduce the spending and narrow those deficits. We commend Secretary Besant and others in the Trump administration for speaking about getting the deficits down. I guess the question is, will we be successful in getting the deficits down? It seems to us an imperative to get the deficits down. I think the United States has benefited from an exorbitant privilege of borrowing and being able to access capital and still run deficits in this country. But the deficits are getting pretty large and, I would say, unsustainable if you're gonna try to run at this pace for the foreseeable future. So I think we have to be concerned about it. I do think the bond market is concerned about it. I don't think these rates are rising because people aren't concerned about it. So I think the bond market is starting to be heard. And I hope that that gets some attention in the halls of Congress, because I think it needs to be a major focus for people in terms of looking at what's the sustainable level of spending in the country going forward. Yes, the bond vigilantes are beginning to rear their head again. At the start of the year, John, you know this better than anyone, the market consensus was that US exceptionalism was set to continue. Everyone was very bullish on the US economy, on US assets. Obviously, that enthusiasm has faded dramatically in amid all of this policy uncertainty. Are you observing clients increasingly looking outside of the US for opportunities? So I may have a different take on this than some. I read all the press, and I understand this US exceptionalism argument or lack thereof, or decline in the US exceptionalism. And I think about it the following way. I think there were excess dollar holdings for almost everybody, because people were really plowing into US assets, and therefore the dollar based on the fact that the US was meant to outperform. But it was pretty over allocated all over the world. And it was well beyond normalcy for the reasons we talked about. I think when Liberation Day happened, and people kind of looked at that and said, whoa, that's not what we thought we were signing up for. We're really a little bit about the disruption in US policy, but a lot about a question about the forward growth curve in the United States, and the veracity of holding that amount of excess dollar holdings. I think we've seen that excess start to come out. Probably not completely out, but start to come out. And I think that's a big part of what we've seen, that global asset allocators are reevaluating. A, do I want to be that excessively oriented towards dollars, and B, do I want to be unhedged? And so I would characterize what we see from clients, global asset allocators, that are looking at currency and global investment dollars, or other currencies, would be, let's think about a little less over allocation, and let's start to think about whether we want to hedge ourselves. And so we're seeing that, but I would still characterize it more at the margin. I mean, if you look at the fundamental asset allocation, I think it's a marginal change in behavior. I don't think it's more than that. I do think the more disruptive the policy is for longer, the more likely you're going to see a more pronounced move, but thus far, I still think it's at the margin. Well, one of the major beneficiaries of that has been Europe. It does seem like interest is picking up in Europe. I mean, what are the implications of that for companies and investors? I agree with you. I think Europe is the prime beneficiary of that incremental amount of hedging over allocation. But remember, Europe as a region, and we can debate whether Europe is actually operating as Europe, still grows less fast than the United States. So if you're thinking about where am I really going to allocate a lot of incremental capital, you're making a bet that Europe is going to start to grow faster, and you're going to get higher returns on your investment in the European economy, which I still think is a bet. I don't think there's any evidence that that's going to happen. Now, what everybody will point to, and I certainly would agree with, is Germany is on the precipice of potentially having a very interesting run in terms of its fiscal span. Germany has always been the country that has the least, the most fiscal headroom and the least willingness to use it, and now that's starting to change. This could be quite important in the context of Germany, obviously, but also broadly the impact it can have around the European economic theater. So I think that there's reasons for optimism, but I'd prefer to see some hard data coming out of Europe that gives you more reason to over-allocate into Europe than where people, I think, sit today. Let's dig into a little bit more on capital markets activity, as well as IPOs. You started talking about this, that there's some signs of a pickup, but as we said, uncertainty in terms of trade policy and other policies is far from resolved, and you've clearly mentioned this bond yield increase. They are moving in the wrong direction as of now. So what do you really think about in terms of the pipeline? Give us a little bit more detail on where you see activity coming from. So we had a really good start to the year. First quarter, capital market volumes were up considerably, 30, 40, 50%, depending on what area you want to point to. And then obviously we had, in the beginning of the second quarter, we had this tariff announcement, which has really chilled the volumes quite a bit. So the second quarter versus the first quarter are down considerably, not surprising. That's consistent with people pausing and taking a step back. Last seven or 10 business days, we've priced 10 or so IPOs. So we've actually started to see some thawing in the markets and a little bit of risk appetite coming back. That's a very good sign. And interestingly, they've all, generally speaking, priced well, traded well, stocks have performed, people are making money by virtue of allocating into those IPOs. That can become quite virtuous. So you certainly don't want to sit here and call a massive turn in the capital markets volumes. But the early signs, as the markets have started to repair themselves and as the tariff policy has come back in to a more reasonable place, I think the signs are good. There's a lot of pipeline. So I could get myself very optimistic about the pipeline, but I've often said, pipeline does not come to fruition in uncertain moments. And so I still think we've got enough uncertainty in the markets that we should be cautious. But the early signs in the last 10 days or so are that the marketplace wants to see more product. I think you're going to see more product come in over the next several weeks. And I expect the summer to be busier than what the conventional wisdom would suggest, as long as we don't have any more exogenous shocks or more disruptive policy, which is maybe a big F. But I think that we're set up for a better period here for the next several weeks than we've had for the prior six, eight, 10 weeks. Let's pivot from the markets and talk a little bit about your role as president and COO. In that role, you deal with operational risk. I mean, operational risk for Goldman Sachs. So we've talked about all of these risks, all this volatility. Tell us how Goldman Sachs is navigating that volatility. What are we doing? Sure. So we think about risk on a very holistic basis. You asked about operational risk. Operational risk is a big and important component, but we think about all kinds of financial risk, reputational risk, market risk, credit risk, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of components of risk. A couple of things to say. Goldman Sachs is fortunately 156 years old. We intend to be here for quite a lot longer. And I think risk management as a core competency is one of the fundamental reasons why we've been able to last for that long a period of time. I've learned a lot in my job about how extensive and how thorough the firm's risk management culture is and how deep it goes. We think about risk as being prepared for the event well before the event occurs. If you're only preparing for the event right when it's happening, you're not gonna be a very good risk manager. So there are three P's that we actually spend quite a lot of time on. People, preparation, and process. And it sounds simple, but there's an enormous amount that goes behind that. There's a couple key elements, I think, that are important to say. One, our risk management teams, particularly in the second line and even in the third line, are very focused on thinking about scenario planning, stress testing, et cetera, et cetera, but they have equivalency to the first line business leaders. So many firms struggle to have risk management be equivalent to the business side. Goldman Sachs doesn't struggle with that. If you're a risk manager in this firm, you're every bit as equivalent and equal standing-wise to the first line commercial producers. I think that's a really important element of our success. The second thing is we have a mark-to-market culture. So we like to look at our balance sheet literally every day and try to figure out how we price every asset on that balance sheet and every liability on that balance sheet. Of course, it's very hard to do that every single day with precision, but we work hard to figure that out. That gives you a sense for where could I actually sell that position if I had to in some size and scale into the marketplace? What's the third-party bid for that asset? That tends to clarify your mind is what are we really saying that that asset is worth and how does that square with how we feel about that risk position? I think during the financial crisis, that was enormously important for Goldman Sachs. Whatever crisis we have in front of us, it'll be enormously important going forward. So those are important elements. We have great collaboration around the firm. We spend a lot of time looking at risk, analyzing risk, stress-testing our risk positions. And we realize that we're gonna constantly be absorbing risk and you just gotta figure out what are you comfortable owning and what are you comfortable not owning? And we're pretty careful about that. We have moderated our risk positioning since April 2nd. I think that's a sensible thing for us to do. It's a more uncertain time, we talked about that. And so we're definitely, we're absorbing a lot of risk from our clients. We wanna continue to do that. But we also, where we can, we pair our risk and stay a little bit closer to home, husband our liquidity a bit more, run a little bit more buffer, just be a little bit more kind of two-footed about it, not overly front-footed about it and make sure that we're ready for continued uncertainty and what that may deliver in the coming weeks and months. And so that's how we characterize where we are now in terms of our positioning and we'll continue to be heavily invested in the culture of risk management and make sure that we can navigate whatever is coming our way down the pike. So when you think about the second half of the year, what are your strategic priorities in the face of all this risk and beyond? Have they shifted at all? So we've had a very consistent strategy at the firm, really for the better part of six or seven years now. And it really has three core components. One is to, as we say, harness one Goldman Sachs to deliver for our clients with excellence. What does that really mean? That really means using our one Goldman Sachs operating philosophy and infrastructure to serve our clients holistically, to be very client-centered, to think long-term for our clients, to not worry so much about how much money we're making along the way, but to assume if we're really valuable to them, we're doing everything we can at the highest possible standard of excellence that we will get rewarded over time. And we take a long-term view on that. So we are gonna continue to try to improve our ability to do that. We've made a lot of progress, but it's a sort of never-ending journey. So that's the first key part of our strategy. And that ultimately comes to fruition in having a higher share of wallet. So if you're doing a better and better job serving your clients, they will deliver you a higher share of their wallet because you become even more important to them. And we measure that by virtue of looking at our rankings with our clients. We kind of obsess over those rankings. We're not obsessing over revenue. We're obsessing over, are we more and more important to the client, which really ultimately comes through in how they rank you. Because ultimately the dollars flow in terms of where they want the dollars to flow. The second major element is to run durable, differentiated businesses that are resilient over time. What does that really mean in plain English? That really means we try to run businesses that are increasingly showing durable revenues through the cycle. So more management fees, more financing revenues, more net interest margin, more revenues that are sticky and seem a little bit more predictable. Nothing that Goldman Sachs is gonna do in a cyclical world is gonna be completely predictable, but we can be a lot more predictable. In fact, we've measured the standard deviation of our risk intermediation revenues in our global markets business, which people often think of as the riskiest thing we do. In the last five years, the standard deviation of our results is 6%. In the prior 10 years, it was 24%. There's some reasons for that. We do have higher share of wallets, so therefore we have a stronger foundation and financial footing, and we're doing more financing. We're more important to our clients, and financing revenues tend to be stickier, so you don't have as much volatility in those results. So that's a pretty good demonstration of the fact that the business is more differentiated, has become more durable, and we've grown our management fees and our asset and wealth management business considerably to the tune of now having over $10 billion in management fees on a firm with $54 billion or so of revenues. So that's the second major thrust of our strategy is differentiation, durability, resiliency over time. The third major area of our strategy is to invest to operate at scale. And what that really means is let's have a better infrastructure inside the firm, a better foundation that we can scale on top of. A lot of technology investment, a lot of focus on automation, a lot of focus on better risk infrastructure, a lot of focus on scale economies. We obviously want to grow. We're a public company. And there's lots of commercial rationale for how we grow, but if you don't have a foundation to grow upon, you're not going to be able to execute on that. So there's a lot of investment that we're making that actually can be quite expensive along the way, but over time you generate real scale economies in doing that. So those are the three major areas of our focus. We'll continue to focus on those three key pillars. Firm is in a very good place right now. I think we're serving our clients with distinction and with excellence. And as long as we do that and we keep that infrastructure in mind and we keep investing in it, we're going to be very, very successful over time. John, let's end with a question on leadership. You have been president and CEO since 2018. So how has your leadership approach evolved over that time? And what's it like being the leader of a large publicly traded organization like Goldman Sachs during such a period of volatility? How do you navigate that? Well, the first thing I would say is it's a privilege. This is a wonderful organization, an extraordinary company. We have a great culture. We're constantly investing to improve it, but it's a privilege to steward and lead this firm. I would say that I've managed in this job through some extraordinary periods, COVID being first among them. We had the Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank and kind of regional banking crisis that we went through. And there've been many others. We've had lots of periods of market volatility and we had a hundred year flood, once in a hundred year flood kind of health crisis. I communicate more and better now than I used to. I think that you realize when you're in this kind of a job that the more you say it, the more you have a chance for people to actually absorb it, listen to it, believe it, and want to execute upon it. And so you think you communicate well, but until you get into a crisis period, you don't realize that you really have to communicate a lot more, a lot more effectively, different channels, podcasts, email is not enough. It's gotta be physical, it's gotta be podcasts, gotta be digital, and it's gotta be often. The second thing is it's a very global firm. And I think until you, again, spend time in this job for years and years, you don't realize how much of the firm exists outside of the New York City where we're headquartered. And so I travel a lot. I spend a lot of time out on the front lines, meeting clients with our people. And I think that that's become more part of my brand of leadership is to really get out there. Don't do it from your office. Do it as much as you can with people, breaking bread where you can, and spending real quality time. And so I think that's the second thing. And the third thing is realizing that there's a holistic aspect of Goldman Sachs. You can tend to want to lean into the commercial part of the firm, where the revenue gets made, where the clients are at the point of impact. But as we talked about earlier in terms of investing the operated scale, I realize that there's so much complexity to the operational aspects of this firm that I'm over-indexing or trying to anyway to spend more time there. There's a lot of technology in this firm. I think that the definitional success of our firm over time will be how well do we deploy technology to make us better? That's not my historical area of expertise. So there's a lot of learning and a lot of work to be done to understand that and figure out how to steward the firm in that direction, working closely with our technology leadership and our business leaders that we're gonna have to continue to embrace technology. So those are areas that I'm working on and focusing on. I try to be very human as a leader. I try to be authentic. As I said, I try to spend a lot of time with people, small groups, large groups, a lot of town halls, some bilateral one-on-ones where necessary. It's a people firm. It's a human capital driven firm. We don't have manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing is our people. It's our culture. It's our time together. It's how we invest to make ourselves better and how we invest to serve our clients the best we can. And I think you can only do that by having a lot of interaction personally and a lot of personal trust. And that's what I'm trying to do every day as much as possible. Thanks so much for joining us, John. Appreciate the time. Thank you for having me. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Monday, June 2nd. I'm Alison Nathan. Thanks for listening.

So how significant will this ruling prove to be? And what impact will it ultimately have on Trump's trade policies? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. For today's episode, I'm speaking with my colleague Alec Phillips, chief U.S. political economist in Goldman Sachs research. Alec, welcome back to the program. Thanks. Thanks for making yourself available on such short notice. Sure. Another big development, it seems, as we sit here on Thursday. Just to recap, last night there was a court ruling that seemed to upend much of Trump's proposed tariff policies. So first, Alec, set the stage for us. Explain in broad strokes what the court said and why it's important. Right. So what the court said, and to be clear, this was a three-judge panel on the Court of International Trade, which is like a district court, so it's the lower-level court. What the panel said was that these tariffs are essentially so large and unlimited that it's hard to reconcile that with the idea that the administration has authority to impose tariffs like that, given what's called the non-delegation doctrine. Essentially, the idea that Congress has the power to impose tariffs. They can delegate certain powers to the administration, but only with intelligible limits. And since there is no limit, seemingly, on the administration's power in this case, the tariffs are just so large that it's hard to reconcile those two things. There was a separate piece of the ruling which spoke specifically to what they deemed the trafficking tariffs, but this was essentially the tariffs from February and March related to Canada, China, Mexico on immigration and on fentanyl, where they essentially said that a different section of the law requires that the tariffs deal with, quote unquote, the issue at hand, and that it wasn't clear that the tariffs that the administration put on those countries dealt with the issue that they had claimed was the emergency at hand. In both cases, they blocked those tariffs. Just to be completely clear, this court ruling relates to this emergency power authority that the president used to impose these tariffs. Yes. There are many different authorities that the president has to impose tariffs. This basically blocked one of those authorities in this particular case. It's not to say that there wouldn't be other powers or other instances where an emergency could lead to some tariffs, but in these particular cases, what this court found was that the emergencies cited did not justify the tariffs that were imposed given the authority under this law, IEPA, which is a law from 1977. Let me just quickly ask, did anyone see this coming? Because this hit late Wednesday night and it seemed to be a big surprise. I will say we were definitely highlighting this as a risk that was out there, and I think we knew that the ruling would be coming soon. That was clear. I think what was less clear was that the court would, number one, rule in this direction, and number two, actually rule on the merits of the case as opposed to just granting or denying an injunction. One of the challenges with these cases on tariffs is that it's not a life or death issue. There's essentially a higher bar to courts granting an injunction when it's ultimately just a question of money, and if the tariffs are ultimately overturned, you can get a refund. It looked like it was maybe going to be a more drawn out process simply because the court might not grant an injunction. They had already rejected a motion for a temporary restraining order, which was sort of the same general test. What ended up happening was they didn't grant the injunction, but they actually just ruled on the case entirely, and so they're essentially now done. I think our general sense going into all of this was that there was a decent chance that this court would rule against the tariffs, but it wasn't the base case. I probably would have said maybe it was a 40% chance or something like that. I was definitely surprised, number one, that we got a full ruling quite so quickly. Ultimately, I wasn't shocked, but I was a little surprised that it went in this direction. The question now is, will the federal circuit uphold the ruling, and will ultimately the Supreme Court uphold the ruling? Talk to us a little bit more about how the administration is responding and what that could look like and what the implications of that could be. They can replace the existing 10% across-the-board tariff with some new tariff. They have authority under what's called Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose up to a 15% tariff, but only up to 150 days. It's an explicitly temporary authority. It was actually, ironically, granted to the president after President Nixon had used what essentially is the same authority that President Trump was relying on to impose a temporary tariff that also happened to be 10% in 1971 when the U.S. was coming off of the gold standard. This is a pretty clear authority that the president has. I would think that if it comes to it, given the choice of letting the 10% tariff expire or switching to this other authority, that they would switch to the other authority. That would then set a 150-day clock ticking. At the end of the 150 days, the question would then be, what from there? I think the answer would be that during that 150-day period, the administration would launch a number of Section 301 investigations. This is what was used during the first Trump administration to impose tariffs on China. The problem is they can't launch 100 Section 301 investigations or they could theoretically launch them, but they certainly can't finish them. I'm not sure how much of a practical challenge that would pose because they could probably still cover most major U.S. trading partners with a handful of 301 investigations. Half a dozen or a dozen would cover the vast majority of U.S. imports. I'm not sure that this really prevents broad application of tariffs, but I do think, if that's the route they go, what you would then see is maybe some smaller trading partners essentially getting out of the situation with no additional tariffs, at least on a country-specific basis, because they're sort of too small maybe to have a specific 301 case, but there's no longer an across-the-board tariff. That's probably the most obvious option. There are some other authorities they could use. There's something called Section 338, which is a provision of law that was from 1930 from Smoot-Hawley that has never been used, which allows up to a 50 percent tariff and does not have a set time limit on it. The challenge with that one is that it requires at least a claim, although no real investigation doesn't have a lot of procedural limitations around it, but some claim that a country discriminates specifically against the U.S. relative to other countries. So it's not just we think that a trade practice is unfair. It's that trade practice is more unfair for the U.S. versus the EU versus some other country, and that might be a harder test for, you know, a broad tariff, but you could see maybe that sort of thing used to implement some specific tariffs on specific trading partners maybe more quickly. So is the key takeaway from all of this that this comes down to what authority the administration is using, and ultimately there are many that they can use, and so those who are looking at this court ruling as, you know, suggesting that these tariffs aren't going to take place should, you know, should be dissuaded from that view. Where there's a will, there seems to be a way for the administration to impose this tariff policy. I think that's right. I mean, I think following the ruling, you saw some commentary along the lines of this is an off-ramp for the Trump administration to get away from a policy that maybe they don't really want to pursue after all. I'm not at all convinced that that's where we are, though. I think that the 10 percent tariff, if they had wanted to get away from that tariff, they could have easily done that, for example, by getting rid of that 10 percent as part of the U.K. trade deal, but they didn't do that. So I think that they are pretty intent on having some kind of across-the-board tariff and would like, you know, would like to get back to that if it is struck down as a result of this ruling. With that said, you know, I do think it probably puts the emphasis on other forms of tariffs. So maybe instead of an across-the-board tariff, maybe it means that you have somewhat, you know, more restrictive tariffs on certain trading partners, and maybe it puts an emphasis more on some of the sectoral tariffs that the president has talked about, but had seemed to not get as much attention recently. So I don't think, you know, four months into this new administration, you know, in a four-year term, I don't think that this is the end of the tariff discussion. And one could argue that, you know, if this decision had come down a couple of months ago, I think markets would have responded really positively. I think right now, because markets had already started to sort of move past the tariff issue to some extent, and maybe on to the, you know, fiscal questions and other things. In some ways, this actually is maybe not as constructive for risk assets, because now we're back to uncertainty around tariffs. People are debating, okay, it was a 10% across-the-board tariff, but will it become a 15% across-the-board tariff now? And, you know, the EU looked like maybe they were going to try to work something out with the Trump administration, but will they launch a Section 301 case now and ultimately impose higher tariffs? We don't know the answers to those things, but it feels like the uncertainty today is a lot higher than it was yesterday. Talk to us a little bit more about how trading partners might respond to these developments, because as you just mentioned, we are in the middle of some big negotiations, reportedly, with some of our key trading partners. So what implications will this have on those negotiations? I think even before this ruling, the administration probably had a challenge in getting trading partners to agree to deals that actually resulted in big policy changes, because it wasn't clear what was, you know, what their interest was in doing that. Meaning, the 10% tariff seemed likely to stay, essentially, no matter what. The UK deal sort of demonstrated that. And at the same time, you know, at least until last week, it didn't seem likely that the Liberation Day rates, those country-specific rates, would end up actually hitting. I mean, certainly, you know, I don't think many people in financial markets were expecting that. I don't think many people in the trade policy community were expecting that. And so that sort of then left the question, like, what are we talking about here, right? And so now we have a different version of that same issue, which is that if the President's power to impose tariffs unilaterally is constrained, then what's the point of making these deals, at least until we see how all of this plays out? That was an issue beforehand. I think there were some trading partners who probably wanted to see how these legal challenges played out before they really made any concessions. But it's probably more of an obstacle now. So I would think that you would see a lot of trading partners continue to talk, continue to negotiate, go at a slow pace, knowing that maybe there's not really an obvious deadline now to conclude those negotiations. But at the same time, you know, there's no reason to expect retaliation right now. And there's no reason to expect people to call off those talks entirely, because the price for just continuing to talk is not very high. And you just mentioned the other issue that has been front and center in markets, which is the fiscal issues. Do these tariff developments have any implications for the fiscal package that's working its way through Congress? You know, should we be thinking about through that lens? What are your thoughts? So, you know, I think it was an easier explanation a week ago to say that the fiscal package increases the deficit, but that the tariffs will decrease the deficit by even more than that, so that the net impact of all of this together is awash in the near term, if not actually slight deficit reduction. And that's what our numbers currently show. If you look at our deficit projections now compared to the beginning of the year, before we knew what the tariffs were going to look like, before we knew what the fiscal package was going to look like, our deficit projections right now for the next few years are actually a little bit lower than they were before. But a lot of that is because we're assuming more tariffs than we were assuming before. And so if you take this roughly, you know, almost seven percentage point tariff increase away, and it stays like that, then that's probably worth, you know, in the range of $200 billion a year of revenue that will not show up. I mean, right now, I think the best assumption is that a lot of that revenue does still show up because they figure out other ways to impose similar tariffs. But if it turns out that that revenue disappears, then what that probably means is that the combination of this plus the fiscal package is, you know, at best awash, and maybe does actually increase the deficit a little bit versus what we have right now. I mean, I would say bigger picture, I don't really think there's a reason to imagine that Congress is going to change their approach to fiscal policy very much simply because these tariffs have been overruled. And that means that we're basically still looking at a greater than 6% of GDP fiscal deficit, you know, as I mean, essentially, as far as the eye can see, that probably was more or less the case before, you know, but removing the tariff revenue is kind of one strike against the fiscal outlook, even though it does help the growth, I mean, potentially helps the growth outlook a little bit. The final point to make is just that I think markets have always assumed that at some point, policymakers would step in and do something about the deficit. And so on this fiscal package, putting aside the tariffs, I think the real question is, are markets comfortable now with the idea that after the major fiscal package that we're likely to see for the next few years, it's not clear what the next opportunity for reform is, that the deficit ends up coming out of this process about the same way that it went into it. So the fiscal issue is a topic for another day. Alec, thank you so much for your insights on tariffs. Thanks for having me.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-05-27 04:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How AI, tariffs, and the energy transition are reshaping infrastructure investing\n**Episode ID:** 4491\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nAI, the energy transition, and geopolitical tensions are reshaping the global economy and markets. They're also transforming the landscape of infrastructure investing. I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. For today's episode, I'm joined by Tavis Kannel, the global head of infrastructure within Goldman Sachs Alternatives, which is part of our asset and wealth management business. We'll be exploring the megatrends driving opportunities and the outlook for the sector. Tavis, welcome to Exchanges. Thanks, Alison. I look forward to our discussion today. So Tavis, we're obviously in a very volatile market environment, and investors are starting to look closely at their asset allocations. So let me start by asking you, what role can infrastructure play in portfolios? Well, look, it's a great question. And in all of our client conversations today, obviously, everyone's reading the newspaper and trying to digest some of the changes that are happening. I think what's interesting about infrastructure is that, in particular, when you look at institutional investors, they've really progressively increased their allocations to the asset class over the last 10-plus years. And so today, to give context, most large institutional investors have around 6%, 7% of their total assets invested into infrastructure. And they've done that for a couple of reasons. I think, firstly, the asset class is really a diversifier. So the correlation has low correlation with public equities, with public fixed income, but also with other private asset classes. I think, secondly, it's been very resilient, in particular, in periods of economic uncertainty, high inflation. So one stat that we talk about with lots of our clients is you look market-wide, and since the beginning of 2022, infra has returned 9% compounded returns across the whole asset class. And that compares with buyout private equity at 5%, real estate at minus 2%. So you look across different asset classes in the period over the last three years where we've had high inflation, we've had, obviously, war and geopolitical tensions, and it's been very resilient during that period of time. And then, really, the third thing is that it's offered pretty attractive absolute returns. And when you think about the evolution of infrastructure, it's like other asset classes, like real estate or in private equity, you can invest in different parts on the risk return spectrum. But there's many strategies within the asset class that are targeting mid-teens plus returns, which if you compound that over five years or 10 years, that's really attractive for investors to have access to. So many follow-ups to that. But before we get into some of the details on that, let's just first define what we're talking about in terms of infrastructure. I'm thinking roads and bridges, but obviously, the space has evolved since then. So what do we mean by infrastructure today, and how has that evolved over the last decade or so? Yeah. So it's not your mom or dad's infrastructure anymore. I think the asset class has really expanded over the last 10-plus years. And that really reflects a couple of things. First and foremost, it reflects how the needs of society have evolved and changed over the last 10, 15 years. So the two biggest segments in infrastructure today are energy, energy transition, and digital infrastructure. And if you were to go back 15 years, those aren't really talked about much. Infrastructure 15 years ago was really focused on transport. That was probably, call it, two-thirds of the infrastructure market 15 years ago. If you look at investment volumes in infra over the last couple of years, transport's been sub-20%. So you've seen a real evolution and expansion of what infrastructure means. When we engage with clients, we talk about four big segments of infrastructure investing. So as I said, energy, energy transition, digital infrastructure, which is data centers, fiber, towers. And then we talk about transport and logistics. So not just traditional transport assets, but also the broader logistics and supply chain ecosystem, which obviously in today's world, there's lots of changes happening there. And then lastly, circular economy. And that's really how we think about water, wastewater, and also circular business models, which I can talk a little bit more about later in the segment. Let's dive into some of those. When we think about some of the categories you just mentioned, data centers, it's a very buzzy word given how much demand for AI is skyrocketing, and that has increased demand for energy and data centers. Talk to us about how investors are putting money to work in that space. Sure. So I think data centers and the overall ecosystem has gone through a number of different eras, I guess to use a Taylor Swift analogy. And the space we're in now is that there's still huge ongoing investment in build out of the cloud. And that's been ongoing for five, six, seven years, but it's by no means done. And then what has gotten a lot of focus and attention is obviously AI, and specifically building out the AI training models. And the requirements are different between what is needed for a data center servicing the cloud and really inference versus model training. And that's both in terms of the importance of proximity to population centers. So in other words, where you're actually locating your data center, and then also just the scale. And obviously, both the power intensity and compute output of GPUs continues on like a Moore's law expansion. But what that means is, again, as you said, the power consumption needed for these data centers is enormous. So I'd say a couple things are really on the minds of investors and thinking about investing into the space. One is that there's been a huge amount of development. But once a data center is developed, and has a long term lease to, you know, a hyperscale, one of the hyperscale large technology companies, like who buys that, and there hasn't really been a fully there's been a lot of development going on. But I'd say the capital markets for a takeout or a sale of that stabilized data center asset is still not fully developed. So that's one thing that's on a lot of investors minds. I'd say most institutional investors have been investing more to the cloud. And I think the question on AI train data centers is, you know, what's the residual value? Like, how long are they going to last? If you have a data center that's in some remote location, because it's proximate to power, like what happens in five years or in 10 years, when that lease is or maybe 15 years when the lease, you know, comes due. So I'd say that's been a big topic for investors in equity. I'd say what's been quite interesting, this is more of a phenomenon in credit is that there's a lot of financing structures that are being put into place really from a credit standpoint to finance this enormous AI build out. And the last point I'd say is that, you know, the power side of the equation is when the really interesting things in infrastructure, you have these four segments, but there's so many linkages between them, is that the investing opportunity in power is super exciting. And so a lot of people both here in the US, and in Europe and other regions, because we've been in a flat power demand environment for 20 years. And now, not just but including because of data centers, we're in a secular growth where, you know, power demand is growing 3-4% a year. And so huge investment requirements, you know, into that as well. I want to dig into some of those points a bit more. But before I do, just for those of us who are not as familiar with infrastructure investing, talk to us a little bit about how the returns are actually made. Do you have to sell an asset, as you just mentioned? You know, the more value add or higher return part of infrastructure investing, it's really, let's call it private equity in infrastructure. And so most managers, most general partners will tackle that through what we call closed-ended funds. And so those mean, you know, what that means is that they will acquire a company, and they want to acquire a company when, in our business, a big part of value creation is buying things well, like hopefully buying things in an attractive value. They want to drive value creation, so drive the growth of that company during their ownership period, and then typically after five, six, seven years, they will, as you say, they will sell, and that will generate a capital gain in addition to any income that they've made along the way. In infrastructure, there's also a number of what we would call evergreen vehicles, so you know, perpetual vehicles. Some are orientated more towards institutional investors, so you know, big pension funds and sovereign wealth funds and so forth. Others, and this has been a more recent phenomenon, are more targeted towards private wealth, like individual investors. And those tend to have slightly lower return targets, but still are very compelling because they offer, again, that compounding, you know, capital appreciation over time. Interesting. Let's dive into another key category that you originally laid out, which is energy transition. Obviously we have the Inflation Reduction Act. That substantially boosted investment in clean energy, but is that under threat at all given the current administration and some of its initiatives? So you know, the IRA and where that goes has been, you know, a very topical thing within infrastructure and has been really on the minds of all market participants, I'd say along with tariffs, which maybe has taken more airtime over the last, you know, month or two. I think a few things to mention. Firstly, most clean energy technologies are actually cost competitive without subsidies. So when you look at what's called levelized cost of energy, which is really a proxy for the all-in cost of power generation, if you look at, you know, solar generation powered paired with battery storage, that is cost competitive without any incremental, you know, incentives from the government. The second thing I should say is that the incentives for, for example, solar have been in place long before the IRA was brought in. What the IRA did was enhanced some of those tax credits and other, you know, frameworks. So I think, you know, when we look at the IRA, there are areas that we think will almost certainly be changed or, you know, partially repealed. Some of those have been telegraphed pretty clearly from the administration, even predating the election. So areas like offshore wind, incentives around EV charging, Department of Energy loans, those are three examples that we expect will be, you know, tweaked. I'd say that the case for a full repeal of the IRA we think is unlikely, although sitting here on May 7th, it's dangerous making political predictions, but we think that is unlikely. From an investor standpoint, I think for the market more broadly, what's important is clarity. These are investments that are typically, you know, 30-year plus lives for, you know, an underlying investment, and the investment horizon of most market participants is, you know, seven years, 10 years, you know, et cetera. So you need the certainty in order to make these long-term, very significant capital investments. And so I think what we'll see, I hope what we see is over the next, you know, month, two months, we start seeing more clarity come out of the administration and coming out of Congress so that people can have renewed confidence to invest. So with all of that in mind, what are the most promising opportunities in the energy transition space today from your perspective? Well, notwithstanding, you know, a bunch of the noise, you know, we actually think on a fundamental basis, you know, both utility scale, so utility scale just means very large projects in, you know, in solar generation, and also what we call distributed generation, which means smaller scale projects that often are directly linked, there's a direct link between generation and usage. So those segments, we think, are very interesting, both here in the United States and also internationally. You know, in distributed generation, what's, you know, what's relevant is that the single biggest constraint, including on data centers and on energy transition generally is the grid. And it's what's called interconnection. So it's basically the ability to connect your project to the broader grid. And with a distributed generation solution, you basically bypass, you know, transmission and distribution, and you have, again, that direct linkage, so you can deliver these projects, you know, much faster, and it also obviates the need for as much investment, you know, in interconnection for those particular projects. And that can offer a real cost advantage to end consumers, whether they're, you know, corporates, or industrial companies, or indeed, you know, end residential users. So that's a space that we think is quite interesting. The other area that's also, you know, quite interesting is around energy efficiency. And you know, when you think about corporates, you know, technology has moved on very significantly over the last 20, 30 years. That doesn't mean that every single corporate user of power has kept up with that. And in many cases, they need a solutions provider to come in and help them do that. So that's also an area that we're spending time on. When you look at the opportunities in the U.S. versus elsewhere, is there a big difference? What are the trends that you're seeing outside of the U.S.? Most markets, if you take, you know, public equities, public fixed income, private equity, real estate, the U.S. market will be typically two to five times larger than the European market. In infrastructure, the two markets are actually almost exactly the same size, which is quite unusual. And so Europe is actually a very relevant investing market for infrastructure. And it's a place where we, you know, where we significantly invest. I'd say what we've seen in terms of sentiment, you know, since the back part of last year has really been, you know, a bit of a shift or a bit of a tilt, you know, towards Europe over the last four months, five months, where I think a lot of the narrative in the back part of last year was around, you know, really exciting growth in the United States, deregulation in the United States, you know, et cetera, and, you know, concern over the outlook in Europe. I guess a few things have shifted. We thought that pessimism was overdone. Maybe some of the optimism now is overdone, but, you know, we think Europe structurally is a very attractive market for infrastructure. You've seen Germany come out with a 500 billion euro plan around investment into infrastructure. There's also been really a renewed focus over the last, you know, six months in particular in Europe around having permitting reform, so making it easier to build, and also recognition that investment in infrastructure is something that can really accelerate growth. All that having been said, you know, governments and most corporates have strained, you know, finances, so they need to partner with private capital to be able to deliver that investment. So, again, I think really interesting dynamics and opportunities within the European market. We tend not to invest in our strategy outside of developed markets, but, you know, there are obviously huge investment needs in emerging markets as well. That's a somewhat different risk profile, and you have to take into account things like, you know, political risk and foreign currencies and so forth, but obviously there's huge needs really all around the world, a lot of activity in India as one example, a lot of people focused on that market, and then also the Middle East, which has really traditionally been a source of capital, but it's increasingly a destination for capital and for investment as well. Before we get too far away from Europe, they also, if I'm not mistaken, have really taken the lead at the forefront of circular economy, one of those other categories that you mentioned. So, you're seeing a lot of traction there. Yeah, so I think, you know, Europe, and particularly Northern Europe, has had a, and continues to have a strong focus on sustainability, and, you know, the political discussion here in the United States has become a little bit more fraught around that topic, you know, over the last period of time, but I think what that's meant is that when we look at many of our infrastructure businesses in Europe, that's a real, if we're a leader in that space, that's a real value creation driver. We can, you know, earn a better return, you know, as a result of that. As I mentioned earlier, circular economy really tends to deal with circular business models, with waste, with water systems, you know, et cetera, and one of the things we see both in Europe and here in the United States is that most of the infrastructure in that space was built 30, 40, 50 years ago, and so again, you know, needs a lot of investment. And then we see interesting areas for, you know, circular business models. One example is, for example, in modular buildings, and this is something where as, you know, as populations move, as demographics change, and as needs adjust, you know, there's often changes in what governments need in terms of health care, education, building large infrastructure projects, so that's an area in which we've invested where you have modular buildings that are provided, they have 30-year lives, they have long-term contracts, typically with governments, so it's a really interesting investment proposition, but it's also a circular model where, again, you have this very long-lived asset, it's got great energy efficiency dynamics, and it's flexible, so it really provides a flexible solution for some of these essential needs of governments and populations. Interesting. So, Tavis, you've talked a bit about how uncertainty around the geopolitical landscape, around tariff policy is complicating infrastructure investing to some extent, but can you give us a little bit more color around that, and also about how the financial market volatility associated with all this is creating some challenges, but also opportunities? I'd say that within infrastructure, on tariffs, you know, the single biggest impact has been in thinking through supply chain and supply chain risks, and especially if you're undertaking significant capital expenditure, then to the extent your supply chain, you know, has linkages to foreign countries where these tariffs have been imposed, that can present a real issue. Now, what have, you know, what have we been doing, what have most other market participants been doing is, you know, this was telegraphed that there were going to be some of these things likely coming down the pike, and so you could preorder equipment, and you could try and get, you know, if you think about your 2025, you know, build plans, well, let's preorder, let's get all that equipment, you know, here into the U.S. before any of that happens. So I think in the very short term, most prudent, you know, managers have mitigated much of that kind of short-term risk. I think the question is longer term, you know, what's the landing zone, and therefore, do I need to reorient my, you know, my supply chain in that regard? And look, we all have a bit of muscle memory from COVID in dealing with, you know, the whiplash in supply chains and, you know, pricing and inflation and so forth. So I'd say at least there's more muscle memory around dealing with that issue. I'd say the second area that has been really topical, and this is more for directly regulated infrastructure assets, has been, you know, the political environment and the predictability of like domestic regulation. And we've seen a number of examples in Europe where there's been quite adverse, unexpected adverse regulatory outcomes, given the overall political environment. And so depending on where you're investing in infrastructure, if you're investing in a directly regulated asset that touches consumers and thus voters, then in a more febrile economic environment where there are cost of living pressures, where there is inflation and so forth, that can impact what, you know, regulatory outcomes in terms of pricing and so forth you achieve as an infrastructure investor. But broadly speaking, you know, these type of environments tend to be really interesting environments for us to invest, because what we'd say there's a lot of dislocation, and there's a lot of noise, and that usually means that things are not priced to perfection. So you know, you can acquire assets at a more interesting basis. And it also means that, you know, many of the ways in which we go about acquiring companies is through public to private. So we will delist a company from the stock exchange. And so you have a period where, you know, stock prices can be moving, you know, can be moving up and down. And infrastructure businesses, which are very long term in nature, those aren't always super well understood by public markets. So this is an environment where I think you've seen, and you're likely to see more activity in, you know, public to privates. I think it's also an environment where corporates, as I mentioned earlier, corporates and governments reassess like what do we need to own. And that means there are more corporate carve outs or spin outs of infrastructure assets where we and our peers can come in and offer expertise and capital to really invest behind those infrastructure assets. So I'd say for an investing environment, it's, you know, it's confusing. There's a lot of noise. But I think it's also a pretty interesting environment in which to be investing. So what I'm hearing from you, Tavis, is it's a pretty good time to be investing in infrastructure. I think it is. And, you know, some of that is, you know, cyclical where we are in the market right now. But I think, you know, the most exciting thing about infrastructure is that it's a way to really invest behind these big megatrends. And you think about, you know, decarbonization, you think about digitalization, you think about the deglobalization or the changes in geopolitics, and that really aligns perfectly with the asset class. So it's a really exciting time, whether around energy, digital, transport, to really have access to these big thematics. Thanks for joining us, Tavis. Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

I'm Tony Pascarello, Global Head of Hedge Fund Coverage in Global Banking and Markets, and today I'm thrilled to be speaking with Rob Citrone. Rob is the founder of Discovery Capital Management, a hedge fund that manages about $3 billion. Discovery focuses on macro investing, with a particular focus on the emerging markets, and they're coming off two massive years in a row, returning to about 50% in 2023 and in 2024. I'm excited to hear about Rob's career, his investment framework, and of course, his view of the world as we sit here today. Rob, welcome to Great Investors. Great to be here, Tony. It's a pleasure. Let's start with the big picture. How are you thinking about the markets right now? Well, I think the markets are offering a lot of opportunities, both on the long and the short side, and we're seeing lots of big swings in people's views of things. I think we have a different view than a consensus, which I kind of like. We're relatively constructive, and we actually think 2026 is going to be a big year for the U.S. We think the U.S. economy is going to boom on the back of significant tax cuts. In 2026? In 2026. I think it's slowing now, but we don't think it's ... If it's a recession, it's kind of what I'd call a fake recession. It's a recession where you have two negative GDP numbers, but mainly because of massive imports, people getting ahead of the tariffs. We don't think real final demand is really going to go negative. It does a very slight, and then we see the economy picking up in the third and the fourth quarter. We see a lot of reshoring of companies coming. You talk to Office Park managers, and they're full now. They've got a lot of LOIs that they've signed. There's a lot of companies here coming to expand. I think in the end, the tariffs will be a good process, ultimately, for the U.S. If I look at the U.K. deal, I think it's a very good deal for the United States when you go through it. I hope a lot of the other ones will be solid deals. I think in the end, we'll end most tariffs around 10%. I think China will be a little bit higher, but not egregious. I think we need to have a bit fairer trade, and so I think it's not a bad thing. So two questions on that. One is, is the constructive story on 26 a function of the policy? Is it a function of Trump 2.0 policy? And then the attendant question would be, what are some of the high conviction views you want to play today or maybe just set up for around the corner? Yeah. I mean, I think it's part of the policies of what Trump is doing. I think also getting rid of some of the wasteful spending and doge I think is also a great thing. But it's really about the U.S. private sector, and it's been about the U.S. private sector for the last 15 or 20 years. And I don't think that's changed. And the technology advancement and advantage we have is enormous. I think the U.S. keeps that. So it's a combination of policies, but really it is the exceptionalism of the United States private sector and the corporate sector in the U.S. Okay. Today, I mean, I think part of the way to play this is we're constructive on the U.S., but evaluations kind of reflect that a lot. So we think some of the best opportunities, quite frankly, are in Latin America and some other places outside the United States. We're incredibly bullish on Latin America. You have very cheap assets down there, and you can make very large returns, not just in equities in Latin America, but you can be in the local fixed income, you can be in credit, you can be in the currencies. There are very large returns to be had there. So we see a political revolution moving to the right, center right, to market economies, to more freer democracies. And we see four big elections in Latin America in the next 18 months in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. And it sounds like the bias coming out of those should be net positive for risky assets in those regions. 100 percent. And the other thing is that, you know, if we're a little bit wrong about, you know, how things play out in the U.S., Latin America is a little bit of a safe haven in all this. If you look, no country in Latin America got more than a 10 percent tariff. Mexico's got the USMCA, where most of the goods still are tariff-free if you're compliant. So we see a lot of positive things happening there that can shield you if the U.S. doesn't do so well. And do you feel like that's getting its due, or do you feel like the Latin America trade is lost amongst the smoke of everything that's been happening? It's been lost for a long time because it's been a loss. It hasn't been a lost decade in Latin America. It's been a lost 25 years since the tequila crisis in Mexico. And so not many people focus on it. I was just at a conference this morning, meeting Argentine companies in a couple of the meetings. I had some other investors with me. Those investors had never been in Argentina, or if they had been there, they hadn't been invested in over a decade there. So there's a lot of opportunities still in Latin America where people just aren't invested. People are really focused on emerging markets in Asia, and rightly so with China and over the years. But I think that's shifted now. I think China is a place where it's going to be a very difficult next 10 years, and I think that Latin America is going to boom. And if we circle back for one second, it sounds like in the end you're still a believer in U.S. exceptionalism. Yes. Makes two of us. Do you worry about the flow of global capital at all in that context? I do worry about it. You know, we're seeing a lot of flows from officials like central banks and others right now that have obviously seen the dollar come under some pressure. So, you know, how long is that going to continue? And, you know, the dollar, I think, is the hardest thing to call. I think we're pretty constructive on the equity market in the U.S. after the kind of selloff that we've had. And we think that the rates, we're in the camp that rates are going to rise in the U.S. in the 10 years, going to be over 5% by sometime towards the end of this year, mainly because the economy is picking back up. But also inflation is going to stay sticky with the policies in the short term. So we don't see a rally in interest rates. We don't see the Fed cutting interest rates. But the hardest call, I think, is the dollar. Okay. I want to take a quick step back. I'm just curious how you would characterize your style of investing. And then as an adjunct to that, how much has it evolved over time? Yeah. Well, I really believe in this top down and bottom up approach where you can, you know, use the macro at the same time, pick individual stocks. I think it's been a huge advantage for us. I don't think many people do it. Certainly not many people do it very well. We've been doing it for 26 years of discovery. But I really learned a lot from Julian Robertson and George Soros and having worked closely with each one of those gentlemen, you know, some of the best legendary investors we've ever seen. And, you know, I kind of combine what I think are the best of the two, you know, Julian with a little bit of long term strategic view, cross checking all the ideas with his Rolodex that he had. And then George was a master trader, putting on big positions, taking risk and then taking it off quickly if things change and managing the risks. I kind of try to combine the two of those in discovery. Got it. I'd be curious, and you referenced this earlier, how important has the short side been, particularly as it relates to the equity asset class, how important has the short side been to your money management and your risk management? I mean, I remember when we first met, this must be at least a dozen years ago, we were at a roundtable dinner and you talked about kind of the significance of some of your single stock shorts, which was a brave thing to say at a table of hedge fund folks. A lot has happened in that context. I think GameStop and all that in 2020, 2021. Flash forward today, how important is it to what you do? I think it's critically important. And, you know, I think it's a lost start. Not many funds are doing it anymore. You know, I learned it from some of the best, from Julian and from George, particularly Julian and what we did in the mutual stocks and when I was at Tiger for over five years. It has really led to the fact the last two years, you quoted, we were 50 percent roughly each year, last two years, a compound 120 percent. Well, we had a net 10 percent equity exposure over that period on average. Plus 10. Plus 10. That's it. Two rippers. Two rippers, only plus 10. So we did it the way you're supposed to, the old fashioned way. We did it with longs and good shorts. And those individual shorts were hugely valuable. Example, we caught three of the four regional banks that went bankrupt. We were short and we wrote in our outlook in the beginning of 23 that regional banks were some of the best areas to be short in the United States. And had you battled that for a while or did you nail the timing? We nailed the timing on the regional banks. You don't always nail the timing on the shorts. And shorting is a dangerous game and you have to be very careful and you have to make sure you're managing the risk. And I think we've done a really good job through that because even through all the game stop and all the other stuff, I think we managed through that very, very well. Here's a question I've always wanted to ask you, which is you do so much. You trade so many different asset classes at times. I presume you have a lot of line items in the book. How do you keep track of it all? How much is kind of in your head? How much is on a spreadsheet or a risk management system? How do you do that? You know, I'm very familiar with the companies we invest in to a large degree. So I've been doing this for almost 35 years. I have a lot of it in my head. Of course, I have great reporting and real-time reporting as well. So I have a real-time P&L system. I can see what's happening in the portfolio. I break the portfolio down into kind of themes. So instead of having to think about each individual line item, I think about the big themes that we have. Like Argentina long has been a big theme for us. India on the long side has been a big theme. Short regional banks has been a big theme for us. China over the last few years has generally been a short theme for us. So I think of things in terms of themes that helps me think about the risk and help manage the risk. Got it. You also tend to have what I would characterize as pretty high conviction views. And despite, again, like I said, many line items, you also can concentrate quite a bit. How does that kind of translate into the way you take the risk and the way you manage the risk? And are there times when you're particularly concentrated and other times when you're not? Or is that always kind of a hallmark of what you're doing? Well, I think there's special times every five or 10 years where there's a really spectacular trade and investment that we then will concentrate in a meaningful way. 2013 in the dollar yen, where we made over a billion dollars, long dollar yen. And in fact, you know, we discussed it quite a bit with George and I kind of convinced George and Scott Besson at the time to go big in that. And, you know, Scott says I'm responsible for 75 percent of his bonus at Soros kind of jokingly over that time. But and then the latest one is Argentina, where, you know, I saw the movie happen in 1991. I was in Argentina in 91. And this was a very similar movie where Argentina in 91 had a reform program that generated a good fiscal balance. They were able to bring inflation down, coming from a very depressed level in the market. In all asset classes, it was the best performing market for four years in a row. This is the same movie in Argentina today, starting, you know, back about 18 months ago, and we got very large in all the asset classes. And we do it in a way where we use all the asset class. So you having many tools in your toolbox, not just doing equities, but being able to do local rates or currencies or credit is a very big advantage for us. But we took a concentrated bet, but we also took in a way that we minimize the risk as much as possible. For instance, in the dollar credit bonds that I took, I only did bonds that basically amortized out during Malay's term. And yet those bonds were yielding 35 percent, which was crazy because the probability default was very, very low over that period. So, you know, I think there's they come around every and I said to our investors, you know, two years ago that Argentina, or actually after Malay was elected, that Argentina is the best thing I've seen since Dalian in 2013. This is the best trade. And you have to do that, but you have to manage the risk. He's right. If we're wrong and things were to change, we'd have to be liquid enough to get out. And both Lien and Argentina are good examples of things that we structured in ways that we can get out pretty quickly. And then when you have a setup like that, when you have, say, a country view, and as you've referenced, you can prosecute that bet a bunch of different ways. Yes. Equities, credit, currency, on and on. How do you first of all, how do you decide? And then within that, do you sometimes mix kind of a pro-risk trade with a risk off trade? Or is it kind of all shooting in the same direction across a bunch of different implementations? I would say generally when it's a big idea like that, they're generally in the same direction. So you're not you're not counter trading anything or hedging anything that way. But what I do is I look at the expected return and what the downside of each of the positions is, and then try to melt it together in the best position as I can. One of the things that was very helpful in Argentina, especially early on, is the equities actually were performing in 23 and the bonds were not. So we were losing money in the dollar bonds and the equities were actually going up. And that helped to counteract some of the declines. So you do get some benefit of having some diversification. But the key is to have liquidity to exit and also get into the trade effectively. And so using all the asset classes really helped. But sometimes like the equities rallied quite a bit in Argentina early on. So we reduced equities, added fixed income and then dollar fixed income. And then when we were able to go into the local peso market, a 35 percent discount with 75 percent interest rates. And we knew that discount was going to come down and ultimately they were going to, you know, get rid of the capital controls and it would merge the two rates. That was a home run trade. So we put capital there, which we had not had any there. We had to be careful on how much we put there. But, you know, we got a good 10 percent position and it was just a home run trade. So there's a hypothesis that markets just continue to get more and more efficient with time. And yet here you are coming off one of your best five periods of money management in a long, long career. And so how do you, I guess the first part of the question is, do you agree with this kind of arc of efficiency? And then how do you square it with how good the hunting has been for you personally in recent years? Yeah, well, I actually think markets in the last five or 10 years are getting less, less, lot less efficient. And they just don't discount things ahead of time as much as they used to in the past. And that actually makes timing difficult. But what we're seeing is with more retail money involved and more just what I would call machine money, they don't anticipate much. They react to headlines, they react to news. And so we see much bigger reactions to news and the discounting isn't as early. So it actually, if you have an ability to stay with your position, it actually has made it easier. But it's made the timing a bit more difficult. So I would say markets are less efficient. I think it is easier for how we manage money. It's easier for us now. But for most people, it's much harder. And I would say that we've been investing the last few years with confidence and not scared. And I see a lot of investors who are investing scared because they don't know what's going to happen. Sure. It feels like a bit of an out of consensus view on the efficiency point. Now, maybe it's one of those things that people just have said at any point in market history, oh, it was easier in the old days. But you're on the other side of that. Yes. Okay. So given kind of everything discussed at this point, it feels to me like you'd say, the opportunity set is going to continue to be really pretty, pretty fertile, whether it's in the macro space or the EM space. Is that fair? Absolutely. Yeah, that's a great, great opportunity for us. I don't know if there's been a time, and certainly in my 35 years of investing, that it's been a better environment for what we do at Discovery and for the skill base that we have, for the contacts and insight we have, for instance, in Latin America and the expertise we have. I don't know if anybody has any better than we do. And for some of the places that, you know, and being able to change mind quickly and having not only a macro, but the micro view. I mean, I've always had a number of technology individual analysts, because if you don't understand what's happening in technology, I don't know how you can invest. So it's been so helpful to our macro view to have understanding what's happening in technology. And it's obviously been a great place to invest as well. And I guess in a different spirit, because everything we've discussed feels quite, again, quite exciting, high quality. What do you worry about? What keeps you up at night? Where can you be wrong? Yeah, well, keeping up at night is not a problem, because I get up the last 25 years at night at three in the morning, every night for the close of Asia and the opening of Europe. So I've been doing that for 25 years. So and then you're up at night on a project to bed after you get back to bed after about 20 minutes. Yeah. Okay. But we do trades, and I'm, you know, I'm involved in making decisions in that period of time. And I'm planning ahead of that. But I do make decisions at that time. It's really a tremendous advantage, because it gives you the feel for the market on a 24-hour basis. And also, I don't know why is the case, but if I ever want to buy the US market or buy futures, it's usually the weakest time of the day is, for some reason, the close of Asia and the opening of Europe. The markets tend to be the weakest point they're going to be. I should actually go back and do a study on that. But that's my feel from doing that. So it's a big advantage. I mean, the world is a very complex place. So there's a lot of dangers out there. So I think that's the kind of the biggest risk, the unknown, that you don't know what's going to happen. That could be a big surprise. I'd be curious, for your 3 a.m. wake up, what time do you go to bed? Then you have your 20-minute bout, and then you go back to bed. And then what time do you wake back up? What's a night's sleep look like? Yeah, right. I try to get to bed by 11.30, because I want to have three and a half hours of uninterrupted REM sleep. And apparently, the Israeli army have studied this very closely. And if you have three and a half hours of interrupted sleep, the other stuff is just superfluous to some degree. You can get a rest. But if you only get two hours, you get woken up two hours, that's actually not very good. So I try to get three and a half hours. Then I'm up from, it's actually 3.15, I get up 3.15 to about 3.30, 3.45, somewhere around, depending on what's happening. On Sunday night, with all the stuff happening in China and all that, I was up for a little bit longer this last Sunday night. And then I go back to sleep, and I get up around 6, 6.30. Okay. And then that segues to my next question, which is, there's not a lot of people who have a track record like yours. There's not a lot of people who have run hedge fund money for as long as you have, where every day is something of a knife fight. And so what's been the key to your longevity? You know, I think number one is you've got to love it. I love it. And I feel like I have a front row seat to the world. I got to work with some great organizations, Fidelity, Tiger, and we've done at Discovery. And so I'm really involved in the investments that we do. Let me give you an example. So I went down to Argentina for one day, the day of their liberation, where they got rid of the capital controls and announced the IMF program. And I got a chance to meet with the president before he met with Scott Besant, and then I went and met with the economic team for a couple of hours before they met with Scott Besant. It just, you know, to be part of that event, which is a big deal for that country, and to help influence it and be part of it is a really powerful thing. I helped get the president of Mexico to call President Trump. She first wrote a letter to him and to some of her advisors I know. I said, look, you've really got to develop a personal relationship with him. He likes to talk. Letters aren't going to work. And she called him immediately. They've developed, you know, six phone calls now. They've developed a pretty good relationship. She's doing an amazing job of managing that relationship. So we're actively involved in our investments as well. And, you know, really, I feel like I have a front row seat to the world. You think you'll trade to your last breath? I think so. I think so, too. Okay. As our viewers probably figured out right now, you're a Steelers fan. You're one of the owners of the Pittsburgh Steelers. What's that experience been like? How involved are you? Yeah, it's been an incredible experience. You know, I'm a lifelong fan. So I grew up as a kid as a big Steelers fan. But, you know, to see it from the inside and be involved in it is really special. But it's also been very special to get my family involved in it, my kids involved in it, and Cindy involved in it. You know, Cindy and I have been on the board really for the last 17 years. And it's been a wonderful learning experience for us. But you feel, you know, you feel even closer to the team. You have even more conviction in what's happening. And you feel like you at least have some input into it. So it's been very powerful. But I really focus on managing the hedge fund. And I let Art Rooney and Omar Khan and Coach Tom, they really run the operation. They know what they're doing. Okay. All right. So we'll finish as we do with the lightning round. First question, what's your greatest strength as an investor? I think the greatest strength is I'm able to connect so many dots around the world and put them together into what actually will happen out of that and have done this and can do it quickly. And I'm decisive and got to be decisive in this business. I'm decisive. And to link back to earlier in the conversation, that is pattern recognition that's between the ears. Is that right? Absolutely. And it's also insight that I get from all the different contacts that I have that are just invaluable. I'd be able to pick up the phone and to talk to some of the leading people in the key countries we're investing in. It's just a massive advantage. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? This could be markets advice or otherwise. You know, I think it came from my dad when I was really young from the day I can remember that he always basically said, whatever you do, do 100%. And if you can't do it 100%, you don't do it. So I always thought you had to do 100%. So I never thought otherwise. And I think that really helped me from an early age on. And when you have success early on and you compound it over time, it makes things easier. So if I think about the people that I speak with in our industry who are running hedge fund money in particular, who've been successful for decade after decade, to sustain that excellence requires an enormous amount of work and focus and effort. And there's almost no other path. Yeah. There's almost no other path. I agree. You referenced George Soros earlier. You referenced Julian Robertson earlier. Who are some of the other investors that you admire most? Well, I certainly admire the two of them. And I learned from them. And I think they're two of the greatest. I admire what Dave Tepper's done for many years. He's a Pittsburgh guy as well. So I think there's a special affinity there. He went off to the dark side with the Carolina Panthers, but we had him for the Steelers for a little while. I still think he secretly roots for the Steelers. But I really admire what he's done. And Stan Druckenmiller, again, another Pittsburgh guy. That track record is phenomenal. So there must be something in the water in Pittsburgh that's special. But yeah, those are the two other guys that I really have a lot of respect for. They've done it for a long time with tremendous records. Away from the markets and I guess away from the National Football League. Where else do you spend your time? What else is of your interest? Well, I do a lot in the philanthropic area. A lot for mental well-being for the youth. We have a big program in Pittsburgh we've had for a number of years, even before COVID. We have five people on the ground there. And that's something that we do a lot. Also in education. I serve on the board of my college and we get involved in education and stuff like that. I'm not very good at it, but I like to play golf on the weekends. And that's kind of fun. Last question. What advice would you give to a young person entering our business today? Yeah, I think the best advice I can give is you have to love it. You have to love it. I mean, really love it. And the second thing is, as you're developing your career, the relationships you build are the most important things. And you need to focus on building relationships and build relationships that are truly lasting. You have to give something in that relationship as well. And you have to keep your integrity and your honesty. And I think that's really key. Okay, beautiful. We're gonna leave it there, Rob. Thanks for doing this. Tony is fabulous. Thank you very much.

It's setting in motion a challenge to the precedent that has long prevented presidents from firing officials of independent agencies without cause. So is the Fed's independence in jeopardy? And how much independence should the Fed have anyway? I'm Allison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month, I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top-of-mind report from Goldman Sachs Research. I recently spoke with former Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and the Hoover Institution's John Cochran about the independence question. I started by asking Clarida what Fed independence really means. Congress created the Fed as what we call an independent agency in 1913 and intended for it to have a degree of independence. How so? First, Federal Reserve governors have 14-year terms and they are appointed on a staggered basis so that governor terms come up only once every two years. The idea being originally that it would be difficult for any one president to appoint an entire board. Secondly, Federal Reserve governors can only be removed for cause, and for cause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as malfeasance, neglect, or dereliction of duty. So essentially, the Congress intended for Fed officials not to be fired by the president solely because he disagreed with their economic policy, and importantly, that was actually upheld by the Supreme Court in 1935. So it's both the statutory language and Supreme Court precedent since 1935 that Fed officials can only be removed for cause, and thus that helps to insulate them from the political process. So in some sense, it is a political organization. It is a creation of Congress, but the Fed has instrument independence, which is a fancy way of saying the Fed can raise or lower interest rates or buy and sell treasuries without political interference. The Fed does not have goal independence, and so the goals of monetary policy are set by legislation, and the goals of the Fed have changed over time by Congress. And so in 1913, when the Fed was set up, the goal was to provide, quote, an elastic currency to facilitate bank intermediation. And then over time, it was recognized in particular after World War II that the Fed had an important role to play in overall economic performance. And so formalized in 1977 in an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act is the current reading of the Fed's mandate assigned to it by Congress, which is, quote, maximum employment and price stability. So when we say that the Fed's goals are maximum employment and price stability, that's really the people's goals as articulated through legislation that's been enacted into law. Cochran also explained that the Fed's independence is not absolute. Fed independence is not written in the Bible as the 11th commandment. The Fed shall be independent. It is something invented by our policy system or by Congress for Congress's purposes. The Fed is independent, but what are the rules of the game? The Fed has a limited mandate. So the Fed's job is inflation and employment. And when you say inflation and employment, you mean and nothing else, and a little bit of financial stability too. But your mandate does not include. Even if you think climate's the catastrophe coming, it's not your job. What's the price of independence? You can be allowed in our democracy to have great power if you confine it to the mandate. Second, the Fed is confined by limited tools. It gets to set interest rates. But it is kind of funny, the Fed's job is supposed to be inflation. The most effective thing to do to create or to get rid of inflation is to, if you want to create inflation, you print money and you give it to people. You know what we did in 2021 to 2023, works like a charm. And the most effective way to limit inflation is to go out and take people's money away. That works like a charm too. That's called taxing and spending. But the Fed is not allowed to do it. Why? Because that's an intensely political thing, giving people money or taking their money away. So it's kind of funny. Here is the Fed charged with inflation, yet the most important tool is denied. Why? That's the price of political independence. Same thing, employment. The Fed is supposed to be in charge of employment. Well, if you want more employment, what's the most important tools? You could change the structure of unemployment insurance, change the structure of social programs, change labor laws, improve the schools, all the things that are kind of getting in the way of employment. The Fed is not allowed to touch that. In fact, you know, your job is employment and your tool is the overnight federal funds rate. So limited tools and limited mandates are the price of independence. Claretta says that this independence is important to produce better economic outcomes, especially lower inflation. And he's more concerned about threats to independence today than he was during his time at the Fed. Well, Fed independence is very important in the very specific sense that history and academic research has shown consistently that an independent central bank produces lower inflation, less volatile inflation, but without any other trade off in terms of excessive financial or real volatility. So in the data, it's the closest thing to a free lunch that you get in terms of economic policy. Interesting. Do you perceive any difference between Trump's attitude toward the Fed today versus during his first term? That's a great question because at one level, the answer is no. He's still being publicly critical of the Fed. He's also hinting, but when he's pressed, he says he has no intention of firing Jay Powell. The difference, however, is that the Trump 2.0 Justice Department is taking the position that the Supreme Court case in 1935, which is called Humphrey's executor, that the Humphrey's executor case itself should be overturned because it represented an unconstitutional constraint on what's called the unitary executive idea of our constitution. And so in Trump 1.0, they oftentimes said they were not happy with the Fed, but they never really pressed the case that they could if they wanted to remove a Fed official except respecting the four cause standard. And the position in the current Trump administration, I think, at least with regards to the National Labor Relation Boards, is that the entire Supreme Court case, which provides that precedent, should be overturned. Another interesting wrinkle here, Allison, is the Trump 2.0 administration is also taking the position that independent regulatory agencies need to get affirmative sign off from the White House on regulations, but they have carved out specifically an exemption for the Fed in terms of monetary policy decisions. And so a related but distinct issue is whether or not the cases working their way towards the Supreme Court will engage on the issue of whether or not the Fed's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities as assigned by Congress are also deserving of that agency independence or if not. But what's interesting about the initial thinking that was communicated by the Trump folks on this is that they specifically are saying that Fed regulation is subject to White House review, but monetary policy is not. So it probably sounds a little bit more complicated than you wanted, but that is the current state of play right now. If I'm hearing you correctly, when you talk about criticism and rhetoric, that's not all that concerning, but you are more concerned that some of these court cases could actually get traction. Ultimately, what would that mean for the Fed? A scenario that would end Fed independence is pretty straightforward. The existing state of play of this is both in statute and in Supreme Court precedent. A president cannot fire a Fed chair, nor can he fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Labor Relations Board for that matter. And one scenario that would end Fed independence is if the Supreme Court were to say the 1935 Humphreys executor case was not consistent with the constitution, it is thus overturned, and any independent agency created by Congress that has forecaused protection for removal, that protection is no longer valid, and an executive for any reason can remove any independent agency official. So that would end Fed independence. What the constitutional lawyers I talked to think could happen is that the Humphreys executor 1935 precedent could be narrowed to essentially only provide forecaused removal protection to the Fed, but would eliminate it for other agencies. Now, it's important for me to comment that in other countries, there are central banks that by all intents and purposes act as though they are independent, but they do not have that particular protection. They essentially have established independence because of a public agreement between the finance ministry and the central bank. And so I want to be clear that although it would be consequential if Fed independence were eliminated via the judicial path, it would be at least in theory possible for the Fed to over time obtain independence, but it would have to evolve in a different way. However, if the Supreme Court case went the wrong way, it would at minimum introduce enormous uncertainty into financial markets, and it would lead to probably expectations of higher inflation. And the way assets are priced and valued and the way capital flows is all intimately related to an assumption of investors that in most, or now really all advanced economies, that the central banks are reasonably independent and that price stability in a low and stable rate of inflation is a reasonable long-term forecast, international financial markets will look a lot different if the long run rate of inflation in every country is subject to the whims of whoever is elected. So it would be very consequential for sure. Let's move on from the court case and just talk about the fact that of course Chair Powell's term is up in a year and there's a lot of speculation about who takes that spot. If someone who is viewed as more aligned with the administration is appointed, what would that look like and how concerned should we be about independence in that scenario? Monetary policy is actually not set by the chair as an autocrat, it's actually set by a committee created by Congress. The Federal Open Market Committee, as we know it today, was created by Congress in 1935. And the statute says that decisions on what we now call monetary policy are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is comprised of the seven Senate-confirmed and presidentially nominated governors, and then five of the 12 reserve bank presidents, with the New York Fed having a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee. And thus to raise rates or lower rates, you need to have seven of the 12 folks vote to raise rates or vote to sell treasuries. The chair only has one vote. Now, by tradition and by practice, Fed chairs are very influential. And I can't think of a circumstance in recorded history where a Fed chair was outvoted on a monetary policy decision. But in the scenario that you lay out, which I should just state emphatically, I do not think will happen for a reason I'll explain. But in the scenario that you described, if a new chair comes in, which has a policy that is demonstrably inconsistent with the mandate of price stability and maximum employment, then he or she would only have one vote and could be outvoted by the FOMC. And so that's an important check on bad policy. And also, whoever is nominated by the Trump White House will be subject to Senate confirmation. And Senate confirmation for Fed chairs is not a rubber stamp. Senators of both parties take Fed nominations, Fed chair in particular, very seriously. And so whoever gets through the gauntlet of a Senate confirmation from Fed chair is going to be someone who I think coming in will have a longstanding career and broad recognition of what sort of a chair he or she would be. And I think will be someone who a majority of the senators and probably well more than a minimal majority of senators think will be capable of respecting the Fed's independence. And I'm sure that question will come up. It actually even came up during my confirmation hearing as well. The other check on the system is once you're in the job and you do even a little bit of armchair history reading, what you realize is that Fed chairs and central bank governors more broadly in the history books are judged first and foremost by did they achieve or maintain price stability. Obviously, there can be difficult circumstances like the pandemic or the global financial crisis. But once you get in that job, you're cognizant at least to some extent that the history books will not be kind to you if you screw up the 40-year legacy of price stability that we can trace all the way back to Paul Volcker and then Alan Greenspan. Rich, I have to say, you sound less concerned about the independence topic than maybe I thought you would. Is that the right interpretation? Well, I put it this way. Relative to my time when I was vice chair, when I thought that the odds that the Supreme Court could actually overturn the relevant case that would make Fed independence null and void, which I thought then were essentially zero, they're no longer zero. There is a positive probability. And so that would concern me. So I'm certainly more concerned than I was when I was a Fed vice chair. It's not a chronic worry for all the reasons that we've gone through in terms of what may happen with the Supreme Court, the checks and balances, the confirmation process, and the committee structure of the FOMC. Cochran agrees that the Fed's day-to-day independence is important, but he says that the Fed should bend to political pressure every now and then because it's accountable to Congress and ultimately voters. Let's say we do have someone who takes the seat and manages to influence the committee to lower rates because that's what the president wants. Ultimately, what does that look like? Well, get out your bell-bottom jeans and your wide ties because it's going to look like the 1970s. Already, even without Trump, the Fed is going to face real trouble. Suppose inflation gets going and the Fed this time isn't going to sit on its hands for a whole year and do nothing while inflation surges. Suppose the Fed has to fight substantial inflation. Without Trump, what do we got ahead of the Fed? First of all, we got 100% debt to GDP ratio. Every time the Fed raises interest rates one percentage point, that's 1% of GDP interest costs on the deficit. To the extent that out of control deficits are fueling inflation, you just poured gas on the fire. Second, if it tries to raise interest rates, hello Silicon Valley Bank, my sense is throughout the financial system, there are lots and lots of people borrowing short and lending long and exposed to interest rate risk and hoping the Fed will come bail them out again when trouble comes. The Fed, if it's not thinking, whoa, if we raise rates, are we in trouble? They're in trouble. Suppose we replay 1979 and the tariffs cause a big recession and inflation and the Fed says, we need to raise rates like they did in 1980 and 82 to combat the inflation. That's going to cause a huge recession. The government responds to recessions with bailouts and stimulus. It's going to pour more fiscal juice on the fire. It's going to be even harder than 80 to 82 to contain the inflation. Think of the political fallout for the Fed when there's already people out of jobs, factories closing, everybody who needed to import anything from China is out of business. That's before Trump's appointee gets going. Trump's appointee needs to be someone who can say no when it's the time to say no. But the Fed does need to bend a little bit to political pressure every now and then. It is a creature of our government, accountable to Congress. And if the Fed wanders off into things the Fed has no business doing and that the people who vote in Congress and the president aren't happy with, it needs to change to that political pressure. In fact, Cochran thinks the Fed has become too independent in some ways. The Fed has just wandered into areas that are beyond the traditional overnight Fed funds rate inflation unemployment. It bought a ton of mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates, you know, subsidizing housing versus something else. That's a pretty political decision. The Fed steered the political waters and kind of dipped its toes into climate risks to the financial system. It started doing a lot of work on inequality. So you can see why people who don't like those decisions are a little mad at the Fed and saying, well, we got to rein in the Fed. It's not in principle terrible to the political system to say the Fed is a little out of control. We need to bring it back. It's the political system that created the Fed after all. So one of the first jobs of the next Fed chair should be an internal reform and recalibration to kind of get back to what is our mandate? What do we do and what do we not do? And that should extend not just to monetary policymaking, but to how we handle financial regulation where I think the Fed has overreached a lot. That has to be done very wisely. But yeah, rethinking what does this institution do and a bunch of you guys are doing things that we shouldn't be doing is, I think, an excellent program. Richard Clarida, however, sees it differently. Some people make the argument that Fed independence has kind of gone awry. Yeah, I've heard that. Wading into too many areas, not consistent with the initial relatively limited remit. What's your response to that? Has the Fed gotten too independent in a sense? Well, I think here the particular details are important. And so some Fed critics point to Fed communication or efforts involving the climate or the green transition. And I'm certainly in the camp and I was as vice chair that that is nowhere in the statute. It says maximum employment price stability. And so I think whatever engagement that we would see from the Fed in that domain, I think would have to be very limited. During my time, the primary focus on things related to climate was simply in the Fed's supervisory capacity. If you had financial institutions with a lot of exposure to climate risk, that should be in the way that they were supervised. And so I think certainly there's a case along that narrow dimension. Other critics have talked about quantitative easing. So the Fed ballooned its balance sheet in the global financial crisis through three rounds of QE. And then during my time, we did QE4 initially during the pandemic and then extended it into 2021. And I think there are legitimate discussions to be had about the cost and benefits of QE going forward and also historical assessments of the benefits and cost of QE. But I don't think the act of the Fed buying a treasury or a Fannie or Freddie mortgage backed security in and of itself represents mission creep or harm to its mandate. It's really more about the fact that QE has become an enduring part of the Fed's footprint in the financial system. So one could imagine the Fed doing QE1 in 2009 and then reversing it and doing QT and reversing. I mean, what has happened is that the QE programs have ratcheted up the footprint of the Fed in the treasury and in the mortgage backed securities market. And so I would distinguish between decisions to keep existing QE programs and keep the balance sheet large from decisions to use that tool in a downturn. And then thirdly, some folks have criticized the Fed in terms of decisions it makes in terms of supervision or regulation as impinging on its independence. And here I think one needs to be careful. When the Fed regulates bank holding companies or state chartered members of the Federal Reserve System, that's not mission creep, that's in the statute. The Fed didn't wake up and said, oh, we're going to regulate bank holding companies or we're going to regulate state chartered members of the Federal Reserve System. That's what the statute says. So I wouldn't call that mission creep as might be the case in some of the other examples. As I mentioned earlier in the conversation, there is a question which will ultimately I think get to the Supreme Court about whether or not the Federal Reserve decisions on supervision and regulation are independent of White House review. Because certainly the decisions of the comptroller of the currency are subject to White House review. And so I think that is something that will be worked out again by the courts probably over the next couple of years. But within the narrow question of when the Fed regulates a bank or a bank holding company, is that mission creep? No, that's in the statute. So Clarida and Cochran disagree on some aspects of the Fed's activity today. But my main takeaway from these discussions is that the cases moving through the courts could have serious consequences for the Fed's independence as we know it. So I'll be watching them closely. Let's leave it there for now. My thanks to Richard Clarida and to John Cochran. And thank you for listening to this episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges. I'm Alisyn Nathan.

So what could be ahead and how should investors position their portfolios now? I'm Alison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined again by David Koston, our Chief U.S. Equity Strategist in Goldman Sachs Research and by Patti Raphael, Global Co-Head of the Third-Party Wealth Management Business in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. They both recently presented at the RIA Professional Investor Forum where they spoke to some of the largest independent investment advisors in the country. David, Patti, thanks for joining us. Thanks for inviting us. Super delighted to be here. Thanks, Alison. So, David, stocks are still down here to date, but as I just said, they are now back to pre-Liberation Day levels, even though tariff policy and the impacts on the economy and companies are still very uncertain. So what do you make of this recovery? Alison, the way I would characterize the performance of the equity market in the last month has been the great concern that shocked the market when the president announced the tariffs and the so-called Liberation Day. And the market quickly pivoted to the idea there's a really dire outcome and the prospects of recession were quite elevated as a result. And the surprise that happened a week later on the 9th of April when the president delayed for about 90 days, the tariffs gave a lot of portfolio managers the confidence that the off-ramp was there and that ultimately the tariffs that had been discussed on the 2nd of April probably would not be implemented as originally proposed. And as a result, the equity market has had a tremendous rally and is currently pricing, in our interpretation, an optimistic outcome. And the expectation right now that some fund managers have is that the economy will avoid a recession. And as a result, the U.S. stock market has rallied back at a really feverish pace. And that would be my characterization of what's happening. And we've also had first quarter earnings, which generally are coming out pretty strong. First quarter earnings have been better than expected. Coming into the first quarter reporting season, expectation was plus 6% year-over-year growth and it's coming in closer to plus 12. So a pretty substantial beat, larger beats than we've seen in the last three years. Last 12 quarters or so, usually been around 4 percentage points. So obviously here we had 6 percentage points, positive surprise. And that's also given investors some confidence that the idea of the economic growth can continue. However, remind you, that was the results in the first quarter, which went through March 31st. The tariffs came in on the 2nd of April, or were announced on the 2nd of April. And as a result, the first quarter results really are backward looking. And the investors really haven't given a lot of importance to that, because really what they're focused on is what's the path forward with respect to these tariffs. If I characterize the real topic of debate, which is the U.S. stock market trades at 21 times forward earnings, 21 times forward earnings, which is historically a high multiple. With a prospect or probability of a recession, maybe close to 50-50 right now. And so you would generally not expect the stock market to trade at such an elevated valuation, given those historically high probabilities of recession. And the only interpretation I can offer is that most of the fund managers have gravitated to the view that we're not going to have a recession. That's priced in the market today. I want to get back to that valuation point. But so as we've just been discussing, I mean, there are tariffs that have been implemented. That the bulk of some of these tariffs have not been implemented, given the pause. But there's still a lot of tariffs that have been implemented. So what do you expect to see from second quarter earnings? Could you begin to see a bigger impact? Is that what you are expecting? So the debate right now with management is who is going to pay the increased tariffs? Is that going to be passed through to the end customers? Or is that going to be absorbed by the company itself? Or is there going to be pushback on the supplier? And is the supplier going to have to bear some of that burden? And that's a reasonable debate. It will depend on the different industry groups, different nature of the product cycle. There's certainly greater risks in the second quarter results, both from a revenue point of view, in terms of actually the demand and how consumer behavior has been, and the input costs, which may squeeze margins as well. So I think there's a lot of concern. We're not going to get those second quarter results until middle of July to middle of August, which will also coincide with what is the end of that 90-day hiatus, which is the deferral of the implementation for a lot of the tariffs until early part of July. So a lot of information is going to be revealed in the next 60 days that we'll know. Now, as a fund manager, investors have generally embraced the view that there's an off-ramp for some of these hefty tariffs and probably come back to a much lower level than was currently being considered out there right now. And I think that largely is priced in the market, this optimistic view that there will be an off-ramp from a lot of the debate and proposed high tariffs. And the market reflects that. Patty, let me turn to you. You have been talking to investors at the conference. When you think about David's comments and the optimism that has been now priced back into the market, is that what you're hearing from clients as you speak to them? So first of all, delighted to be live from the RIA PIF, the Professional Investor Forum, where we've gathered about 100 of the leaders of the top RIA firms across the country. In aggregate, the investors and the leaders that are here with us and their firms manage $1.3 trillion of their clients' capital. And so it's a very important group that we've assembled here. And overall, RIAs are a fast-growing part of the investor segment in the country. Sentiment right now, as we're experiencing it, is, I would say, still pretty uncertain, but super engaged. So the clients aren't shying away from the uncertainty. They're not paralyzed by fear. They're highly engaged with the markets, with solutions, and with their clients. And what I would say is there are an increasing range of products in the market that really offer different ways to capitalize on market movements, whether markets are going up or going down. For example, we have solutions that can benefit from higher levels of volatility in the markets and increasingly looking at short-term dislocation opportunities that present really interesting long-term portfolio benefits. And so I would say those types of conversations are dominating our time and mindshare with those clients. There's been a lot of discussion about the loss of U.S. exceptionalism. Are you hearing clients considering pivoting away from the U.S., which has obviously been the most popular place to invest for quite some time now? Sure. So in my capacity as global co-head of the third-party wealth business, I actually travel intensively across not only the U.S., but Europe and Asia as well. In fact, I'm heading to Asia next week, and I'm heading to Europe the week after that. And so I would characterize slightly different sentiment across the globe. From U.S. investors, I would not say shifting away from U.S., but I would definitely note that there has been a higher interest in some of the international markets, in particular, some of the European markets. And so we are seeing a desire to add where people have been already successfully investing globally and internationally to add to some of those positions. I would say from European investors, we are seeing a bias towards repatriating towards more home country exposures. And then from Asian investors, and I'm being super reductive and generalist here, but I would say U.S. exceptionalism and the brand recognition around U.S. companies is still very strong. And so my recent conversations with investors from that region, from Asia, have not reflected any kind of loss of the shine of U.S. as a destination for investing. David, from your perspective, listening to what Patty has to say about this, I mean, do you think there's more compelling opportunities abroad relative to the U.S. than there perhaps has been in the recent past? How are you looking at this? Well, I was in London last week and the perspective of the European investors was that the weakening U.S. dollar, an expectation of a secular weaker dollar, does present some headwinds as a non-U.S.-based asset manager owning U.S. assets. Now, offsetting that is the U.S. companies have better growth, much higher return on equity, and traded higher valuations. So the U.S. stock market trades at 20 times earnings right now. The rest of the world trades something like 14 times approximately, but you get much better growth and higher profitability for U.S. corporations. But when you adjust that for growth, if you think about it in terms of a PE to growth ratio, a PEG ratio, they trade pretty similarly. And they have over time, in terms of that, you're paying a higher multiple for the U.S., we get better growth. And what it comes down to is the U.S. has a lot of technology companies, which of course everyone knows, and they're global leaders. And that has been the real allure and been the right strategy for 15 years. And now the concern is fund managers. Well, what is the prospect of these companies, given they are investing an extraordinary amount of money in CapEx, particularly around artificial intelligence? And what is the return on capital going to be for all those huge dollar amounts that being invested? So we think about it from a risk-adjusted perspective. The U.S. is not as exceptional as it was in the past, as perceived, given some of the dollar headwinds. And there's been a desire to repatriate some capital overseas. We see that in our fund flow analysis that we've seen in the last couple of months. Money is coming for European investors in particular, money coming out of the United States, back into their home countries, if you will. The concern has been a lack of liquidity and other opportunities internationally. So the U.S. is somewhere between 65 and 70% of the global equity benchmark, depends on what benchmark you use, just the size of the market and the liquidity that's here. Means that investors aren't just going to leave entirely, but on the margin, money is being viewed as perhaps interesting opportunities over abroad right now. And do you agree with that? I mean, is that something that you think is justifiable? Well, the Goldman Sachs Portfolio Strategy team globally, we have been arguing for a broadening of the return structure in the market. Inside the United States, that would be an equal-weighted index, as an example, as opposed to a cap-weighted index, as a way of getting a stronger risk-adjusted return. And we take that on a global level, the idea of opportunity sets globally in other equity markets, somewhat more attractive than the U.S. They certainly started a lower valuation. They've had better returns this year. There's some concerns about the multiple for the U.S., and that is a view that would suggest, from a return opportunity set around the world, maybe more attractive than the U.S. right now. And Hadi, we've heard so much about private markets, that's the public markets. When we think about the private markets, private equity, private credit, what are the investment advisors thinking about right now? Have we seen allocations continue to rise? Is the interest growing? Absolutely. Private markets is definitely coming into the sunlight, I would say, as an asset class, or as a collection of asset classes around the globe. Again, I would say there is a huge amount of interest from a growing base, a broadening base, of individual clients as represented by their financial advisors. And I would say from our perspective, from a GSAM perspective, we believe very strongly that individual investors, and particularly high net worth individual investors, will benefit from having the same kind of access to institutional grade investing opportunities that the most sophisticated institutions and the wealthiest individuals have enjoyed for decades. And private markets is the perfect example of that. If you think more broadly, is there anything that investment advisors are focused on that retail investors might actually need to be more focused on than they are? Yeah, absolutely. One kind of opportunity or challenge in the market that we're paying a lot of attention to is the concentrated stock phenomenon. So there are tens of trillions of dollars of brokerage assets, equity brokerage assets, sitting in clients' accounts, of which a very large proportion are concentrated, which means more than 25% of the account is dominated by a single position. Investors are often very emotionally attached to these positions. They've been in their family for generations, or they're a result of having worked for a company for many years. But history guides that holding a single stock position is a coin toss relative to a broad-based index exposure diversified portfolio. Some stats to help bring that to life. Since 1992, there have been 9,227 stocks that have ever been part of the Russell 3000 Index. So many of those stocks, about 6,000 odd, have come out over time, leaving 3,000 odd in there today. The median performance of these 9,227 stocks is just 2%, with about 50% of those stocks having exhibited positive performance and 50% negative performance. In fact, if you take those 9,200 odd stocks, you'd see that 46% of them, or nearly 50% of those stocks, experienced a 75% drawdown during their life, of which 8 out of 10 of those stocks never recovered. Relative to if you'd held the Russell 3000 Index through an ETF or a mutual fund, you would have had about a 10% return since inception. So that's the value of diversification versus having a single stock exposure. So David, we started out this conversation, you feeling that the market was perhaps slightly too optimistic relative to some of the risks that we still have in this market today. Again, tariff uncertainty very high, policy uncertainty in general very high. Very quickly, if even our expectations in terms of tariffs play out from here, what would that mean for the S&P 500? So the S&P 500 direction will move higher, the index will move higher under our baseline forecast. Our baseline forecast has the economy growing, albeit at a pretty weak or low rate, but not have a recession. And in that context, earnings are growing. And so as we move through the balance of 2025, the investor community will be more focused on the growth into next year. And the earnings growth usually over time will take the market higher. So yeah, we're somewhat positive as well. What's the downside though? I mean, if we do end up in a more severe, because some of the things that are still being talked about, although the market has viewed it as a reprieve, they're actually worse than we are expecting. So what's the downside? So in an downside scenario, earnings could fall by around 10%. It could fall a much greater amount, of course, but in a scenario, looking back in history, earnings typically fall by around 10% in a recession. Again, that's not our baseline forecast, but in a scenario of a recession, you'd have earnings come down and the valuation would contract as well. And so you could see the market, the S&P 500 level, for example, trade around 4,600 in a more recessionary environment scenario. So balancing those two outcomes, it seems as the recent news flow would suggest, perhaps there is this off-ramp and some of the draconian tariffs that have been proposed originally on the liberation day of April 2nd, perhaps will be avoided. And as a result, the economy is likely to direct itself towards a non-recessionary outcome. And in that case of what's priced today in the U.S. stock market is the more optimistic scenario that we're envisioning will transpire. Right. But the risks are wide and the spectrum of outcomes as well. That's correct. And there are always risks. There's wide distribution of the risks and the market's pricing the more optimistic scenario. And we think that's probably appropriate given the news flow that we're getting from Washington, D.C. David, Patti, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks Allison. Thank you so much, Allison.

I'm Alison Mass, Chairman of Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs' Global Banking and Markets Business and your host for today's episode. I'm thrilled to be speaking with Katie Koch, the President and CEO of TCW, a global asset manager with more than $200 billion in assets under management. Prior to joining TCW as CEO in 2023, Katie spent 20 years with Goldman Sachs, where she was a partner and most recently served as the CIO of the public equity business in our asset and wealth management business. I'm so excited to speak with Katie about how she's leading TCW, building the culture and navigating the firm through a period of rapid change for the fixed income asset class. Katie, great to have you on the program and welcome back to 200 West. Thank you. I'm so excited to be here always. So some of our regular listeners may remember Katie was one of my co-hosts for this podcast, which Katie and I first started in 2020 as a way to hear how leaders across the financial services industry were managing and investing through the pandemic. So Katie, how does it feel to be on the other side of the mic as an interviewee as opposed to an interviewer? Well, first of all, I always love being back at Goldman Sachs. I have to say that when we started this and you, it was your idea, but you were kind enough to ask me to participate, which ended up having huge benefits I want to talk about. But we were like on our laptop Zooms and now you guys have this whole, it's very Goldman, just keep taking it up to the next level. So we try, we try. It's great to be here and great to have this experience. Thank you for having me. I would say that I prefer being the interviewer instead of the interviewee. Sorry about that. Not today. Not today. But I do like, I just really loved that experience in general because of course, when you're not talking, you're not learning. So it was great to have this opportunity to go speak to all these smart, incredible people and really listen and digest their philosophy and their process. And that was real highlight for me. So thank you for involving me in that. And I was thinking about it on the way here and I met so many great people and interviewed so many extraordinary people through that process. But there are three that really actually had a massive formative impact on what I've gone on to do with leading TCW. So when you and I did this, I had the opportunity to interview Scott Besant, who of course is the CIO of Key Square Capital, now obviously the Secretary of Treasury. Great guy to know when you run one of the world's largest fixing shops. I got to know Jean Hines, who is the CEO of Wellington, also a mother of four kids like me. And she became really someone I reached out to for advice when I was considering this opportunity and someone that I built a great relationship with since I started leading TCW and been able to talk a lot about the job and also the family aspect with her, which has been very personally fulfilling. And I met Howard Marks, who actually spent a formative part of his career at TCW. And he and I met through this process. And then we've gotten to know each other and get breakfast or lunch once or twice a year. And so he's given me great perspective on it. So in life, you don't know how these things are going to work out, but I'm so glad you asked me to do it. And it's an honor to be back. And honestly, once I tick through those list of people, I'm wondering, why am I here? I don't belong in that long list of people, but it's an honor always to be back. So it's a lesson. Next time I ask you to do something, the answer will be yes. Yes. Well, it always was. Yes. Anyway. All right. So let's start with your transition from being CIO at Goldman Sachs Asset Management to leading TCW. It's a big change. And we were lucky to have you at Goldman Sachs for 20 years. But share with our listeners why you made that move. Sure. Well, first of all, I am the lucky one. I was probably one of the least qualified people ever hired by Goldman Sachs. Not true. But really, they took a chance on me. And there's no limits to my gratitude for that experience and the 20 years I spent here. We should talk more about that because it fully equipped me to do this job. And I'm very grateful for that. But for me, I was in asset management when I was at Goldman Sachs. And it's an industry I love. I love investing. And I wanted to try it in a different context. So I wanted to do it in a place where we were in the monoline business of just asset management, ideally do it somewhere that's privately held, which we can talk more about. And this opportunity came along. And I thought, you know, I really love to set strategy and build teams and build cultures. And this was a great opportunity to do that. And I felt, like I said, I mean, you're never fully ready or fully prepared, but I felt ready enough to take the leap to do it. And it was a very good decision for me and for my family. So talk a little bit about how you adapted from being an investor to stepping into a CEO role. Right. So there's part of it that you are very prepared for as a CIO, becoming a CEO. And then there's another part of it where you're not as much. So I guess I'll split those apart and walk through them. One thing that you bring, and I think makes you better at running an asset management organization if you have been in the investing seat, is that you bring a lot of empathy and understanding to the job because it's a really difficult job. I mean, you are trying to predict the future under circumstances of extreme uncertainty. And you're trying to prosecute continuously and consistently a philosophy and process that by definition is not going to work every day and not going to work every quarter. And so it can be really trying emotionally and psychologically. And I think having gone through that experience, it has helped me be a better leader of an investing firm because I'm able to understand part of the psychology of what people are going through and to support people through those difficult periods. Because in investing, it's usually the point of maximum psychological pain when you get to that inflection point and things revert and your philosophy and process will work again. I feel that I got trained well in that and that I've been able to bring that to the job. The part that's different is when you're investing, you make capital allocation decisions, obviously, in a portfolio context. And of course, as a CEO, it's one of your most important jobs is to make capital allocation decisions, decide what businesses to support, what new business lines to enter, etc. But you also have to execute. And I just think back to the investing days and sitting across from CEOs and asking them a lot of questions and scrutinizing their plans. I don't think I fully appreciated how hard it was to take the vision and the strategy to execution. And so as a CEO, you're responsible for that in the operational part of the business, you're responsible for that execution in a way that you didn't fully understand as a CIO. And I have come to understand that and get better at it. But the bringing of those two things together, I think, are the skills that you need to run a successful asset management organization. So I'd like to dive into TCW's business. The firm was founded in 1971, has a rich legacy in fixed income. Talk about how TCW has evolved and what does it look like today? So we're established over 50 years ago and have been independent, privately held for that period. There's actually just not that many asset management companies in the world that have that long of a tenure of existence and continue to be independent. So it's a real privilege to have the opportunity to lead the platform. It was started actually by a gentleman named Robert Day, who was a scion of the Keck family. And the Keck family is very well known in America as being the founders of Superior Oil, which was the largest independent oil and gas company in America until it was sold to Mobil. And then he was a next generation individual and was able to start and lead a very successful company in a totally different industry, which, as you know, is pretty unusual in and of itself and interesting. He unfortunately passed away last year, but I did have the chance to meet him and have lunch with him before I started. And he said something to me that really stuck with me, which is, you know, remember, you're in the investing business and allow it to compound over time. And in investing, this concept of compounding is very important. That's what Albert Einstein calls the eighth wonder of the world and the people that understand that will earn it and the people that don't will pay it. I'm a big believer in all of that and thinking about life and also investing. And what he was trying to say to me is that there is a great heritage here. Don't mess it up. Allow that pressure. No pressure to allow that to compound. But we had another part of the conversation, which was about you kind of have to evolve to stay relevant to right. And so that's the healthy tension of what we've been working on together at TCW since I started, which is let's respect these great, incredible attributes of this company. The fact that it is an investment led culture. The fact that we have very differentiated philosophy and process anchored in value investing, which is very much enabled by the fact that we're a private company with a long horizon. So respect and keep all of those things that are great, but evolve the platform for the fact that the future is changing in terms of new vehicles for us that would be exchange traded funds and liquid markets, which we didn't have before, and expanding our footprint in alternatives as that grows. And I keep that in mind every day. How do we respect the heritage of this company while evolving it for the future? Yeah. So speaking of evolving, under your leadership, the firm has made a big push into alternatives and private credit. Talk about what's driving that and the opportunities you see there. Sure. So when you gave my title at Goldman before I started this, so I ran an equities business. For many reasons, was not maybe the first person people would think of to run TCW. One is that it's largely a fixed income shop. And so I had a lot to learn. I still do. One thing I was able to bring to the role that I think was valuable is the pattern recognition of how asset classes evolve and get disrupted over time. And when I ran the equities business, I understood that the public equity market shifted dramatically over the last 20 years. You saw it from the other side because you, of course, led financial sponsors. So you saw private equity taking share from public equity. And in the United States, there's now 50% less companies, publicly listed companies, than there were when I started in this industry. And I just had some intuition and some pattern recognition that we were in the early stages of that happening in fixed income. And that pattern recognition led me to say, we as a group, we need to understand that the landscape is shifting and we have to do more to be relevant in the fixed income markets and do more in the private markets. So big picture, we need to be relevant ultimately to the borrower, to the CFO. And it's actually even more complicated and in some ways more important than it is in equity markets for the following reason. If you're a CFO on the equity part of your capital structure, you have one decision to make, be public or private. But in the debt part of your capital structure, you can be both public and private at the same time. You can even be IG and high yield at the same time. You can lend against corporate cash flows. You can lend against securitized assets. You can be much more creative in that part of the capital structure. And for us to stay at the forefront for clients, to be relevant to clients, we have to be relevant to the borrower. And that really is the philosophy from which we've pushed further into alternative credit. So it's very popular to be an alternative credit now. So I really want to make the point that we are not tourists in alternative or private credit. We actually have one of the longest track records in the industry in private credit, but we are putting more emphasis on it now. So I am simply building on a strength that already existed and putting a little bit more focus on that and really coming at it from how do we stay relevant to the borrower? How do we stay relevant to our clients? So how are institutional investors thinking broadly about portfolio construction and the mix of public and private asset classes today? I do think this is going to evolve a lot. And I think we're going to orient more towards people looking for holistic solutions versus being able to sell individual products. I've just seen a pickup in the last couple of months, both of sovereign clients and of pension funds doing two things. One, giving us a return target and saying, I don't want to deal with ABF and private credit and ABF Mez versus IG and the CLO business. You guys do that. I'll give you a return target. You put it together in a way that will hit my quality standards and my return target. So there's more of those conversations happening. And then if you just take one of the dedicated buckets, like securitized investing, people wanting to look at the best opportunities across public and private to build a securitized portfolio. And then even within private credit, and by here, I mean traditional high yield private credit. Private credit has become bigger than the high yield as an asset class. But we have people saying in the non-IG space, you mix together private credit, traditional high yield, and the CLOs, bank loans, put all that together and build me a non-IG slash high yield portfolio. So I think the clients are putting the work back on us, which is good. And that's what we're here to do. And they're asking us to come up with more holistic solutions versus just approaching that with individual products. So let's take a step back and talk about the macro environment. And I wonder whether that change is a result of this environment we're in. I mean, we're recording this podcast at a time that's truly extraordinary. Markets are volatile and geopolitical tensions are high. And as you're adjusting your investment strategy in this environment, how much of that is driven by what's going on out of your control? This is a very volatile environment. I would also say this is our market. This is great for us and for our clients because we have heightened volatility, heightened uncertainty. It's great for active management. And across the platform, we're generally value investors. So put simply, where we shine is when we can step up and provide liquidity when other people can't or won't. So we came into this year with a lot of dry powder and a lot of cash. That is true in our private credit business. And it is also true in the way we invest in public fixed income. So in private credit, the last couple of years, a lot of capital came into the space, a lot of what we call optimistic lending happening. That's not good. You don't want to be an optimistic lender because you're just trying to get your money back. So that's not a way to get your money back is to be overly optimistic. And we tend to have much lower levels of deployment in those environments. And so we came into this year with a lot of dry powder in our private credit business. And then on the public side, we were at our maximum where we have portfolios that are cross-sector. We were at our maximum underweight for credit. Now we're not geniuses. We don't have a crystal ball, but we have a valuation discipline. Very simply put, when we looked at the valuations being demanded both in private and public markets, the forward returns were negative. And in that environment, we won't allocate in size to those asset classes for our clients. And so that set us up well for this year. We actually had one of the busiest trading days in the history of TCW two weeks ago. And we are now starting to take advantage of these dislocations to buy credit for our clients. So we are saving for people's retirement. We do not wish a recession or the human impact it has on people. But again, we're trying to help people maintain and build wealth. And actually, this is a pretty good environment for the way we invest to do that. And we will continue to stick with that philosophy and discipline. And I will say to you, one of the most important things to have in this industry is to have a process and a philosophy as well as experience of getting things wrong. Those are like the two most important things to have, discipline and a lot of experience. And we bring that. And these environments are very fruitful for us to generate outsized returns for clients. And that's what we're seeing so far year to date. So in addition to my day job, I lead the firm's Office of Alumni Engagement now, as you know. And we recently conducted an analysis and found that more than 600 Goldman Sachs alumni are in the C-suite of leading companies. And included in that number are more than 180 CEOs, including you. So thinking back to your Goldman Sachs experiences, were there any influences or experiences in particular that shaped the way you lead today? That's pretty extraordinary. It is extraordinary. And what I take from that is that Goldman Sachs is a place that manufactures talent. And I said at the outset that I was one of the least qualified people hired here. And I'm not trying to sound like cool or overly humble. I truly was. I was a literature major. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing when I started. And the only thing I had to offer was hard work and diligence. And I did offer a lot of that. But that's all. I mean, that's the only thing I could do because I didn't know anything. And then you think about it. And 20 years later, I have the privilege of leading my own company. And I think it really does say a lot about Goldman and its ability to take in people that are, hopefully, I would say, intellectually capable, in my case, in earnest, and turn them into leaders. That's actually remarkable. So congratulations to you guys on that track record, or to us, I guess, as part of the alumni group. Once a partner, always a partner. Thank you. And then you, yeah. So you're asking, did I learn things here? I mean, I learned everything here, right, because I knew nothing when I came in. So what are things that I learned beyond you have to work really hard, which in and of itself is a very important lesson? I certainly got to move around a lot here. And that was very powerful. And what I mean by that is that I worked across multiple cities, countries, mostly in asset management, but I had the opportunity to run a number of different businesses in asset management from the multi-asset space to equities. And you just learn a lot about different asset classes, about how clients approach problems, about how you can help them. And this is a place, at least it was for me, that if you had the intellect and you put in the hard work and you put up results, there really was no limit to the opportunities that you got. So I feel like the mobility helped me a lot, prepare me for this job. I would say I built incredible relationships here. So of those people that you mentioned, many of them are my friends. I know in the industry, it's the best phone-a-friend network on planet Earth, because either I kind of can figure out what to do through pattern recognition, or I have a big Rolodex of people that I can call on to do that, you being one of them. And on the relationship part, I did learn from you and other people here how to build relationships. And it's very important. I want to spend just a second on that, because I feel like this next generation – I sound like an old person saying that, but the next generation of people doesn't have all the instincts in doing that, which is that I was taught with clients, and also internally, that you needed to not be extractive, to invest in those relationships and what you can bring to those relationships, and make the withdrawals before you take deposits. That was a very powerful lesson for me, and it allowed me to build great relationships at Goldman. And also, after I left Goldman, to now these people running companies, countries, central banks, et cetera, and they're people I had good relationships with because I came to it first with, like, what do I have to offer? And I even remember the first time I met you, I said, that woman's amazing, and I love how she's running her business, and there was a personal part of you that really appealed to me with balancing that with your family. And I wrote you a handwritten note to tell you how much I appreciated meeting you, and I really reflected on what could I bring to Allison that would make her care about me, or talk to me, or meet me. And we did some work on your clients, remember? Because I was in the equity business, and I said, well, maybe her clients would want to hear what does an investor on the public equity side think about this company? And that's how I approached you and convinced you to care about me, right? And to be my sponsor and mentor, but that was such a powerful lesson for me, because I thought about what I could do for you, even though I was very junior at the time, that would be of any value before I said, what can Allison do for me? Now, in reality, you've done a lot more for me than I've done for you, but I started from the place of what can I do for you? And so I learned that here, and that compounding of relationships, and the connecting of people, and not being extractive, and actually thinking about what you can put out into the world before you take something from it is a lesson that I learned here. Also, in that selfless bucket, I remember something I think about at least once a week was our mutual friend, Stephen Sherr. I went to him, and I told him, I'm sure I had this conversation with you too, at one point, how ambitious I am, and I want the next job, and it was me, me, me, me, which is extremely painful, by the way, to hear when you're a CEO. So now I understand it more than I did at the time. But he gave me the advice, which is like, what is the industrial logic of what you're asking for? Think about why it's good for the company and the clients, and then frame whatever it is that you want in that, because if you're trying to win for the company and the clients, you will ultimately win for yourself. And you gave me versions of that advice too over time, but that really helped me succeed at Goldman, and it's helped me coach people at TCW. So that was a big part of what I learned. And then finally, we had a great, and I'm sure still have, a great feedback culture here. And I had to really work on that when I came to, and we are building an amazing feedback culture, where people are willing to, we create the psychological safety to give people feedback, because you want them to win, and you want them to be more effective. And that, I think, is very positive for any culture, and a lesson that I took from my time here. So before I ask you more about the culture you're trying to build at TCW, because I want to hear about that, you're helping me with my clients when you were CIO at GSAM, carries on today. So you should be proud that your team, who worked for you and with you then, continues to do it, and not just with me, with a lot of the senior bankers, and it's very valuable and value-add to the CEO clients. Yeah, I love that. It's a good thing. And I had such an extraordinary team there. I want to say one last thing, which is that when I left to do this job, I'm 44 now, I was 42 at the time. And so you learn how to run people problems process at scale, right? You get trained on that really well at Goldman. And I honestly could have done with another few years, even maybe a decade of learning from David and John and you and other people. I left a little bit early in some respects. And so I talked about the phone-a-friend network as being important, but one thing that you connected me to that's been helpful is you introduced me to Idina Friedman, who's the CEO of Nasdaq. And I have the privilege now of serving on the Nasdaq board because of that introduction and because of the fact that we at one point were shareholders and we had that conversation with her. How do you evolve from being rated like an exchange company to a technology company? And we engaged in that discussion, got to know each other. And then when a board seat opened up, she thought of me and I was able to take advantage of that opportunity. And she's formidable. That's one of our favorite words, right? And she truly is. And I didn't do it for that reason. I did it because I thought I could add value to the shareholders of Nasdaq. And I will, I'm sure, at some point. But actually, one of the biggest benefits to me is to see an executive, how they manage their board, how they manage their senior leadership team. And I'm so fortunate to still get that opportunity every day. It's something Goldman created for me, but I get that opportunity, those learning experiences even in this role. Because at TCW, there are a lot of people that are a lot smarter than me, but there's actually not that many people that have more executive experience just because of the type of business that we're in. So that ability to learn from Adina on a continual basis and see someone doing it at the zenith of their career and at such a dominant position in their industry is really a gift. That's a great relationship story building. So let's go back to the culture you're trying to build at TCW. You talked a little bit about the feedback part of the culture. What are other things that you're focusing on in the culture there? Number one at the top of the list is integrity. We are going to get investment decisions wrong. That's part of the business. It's a tough business, and we will get some of those wrong. And that's not just forgivable, it's understandable and expected. What is not tolerated at all is any sacrifice of the values or the morals or the way we show up for clients. Because every company is built on trust, but none more than the investing industry and asset management. So integrity is at the top of the list, the bond that we have with each other and with our clients. Second is humility. As I've said for many years in this industry, you're either humble or about to get run over. And that is one of the most important qualities of any investor. The third is intellectual curiosity. And so we have already a lot of intellectually curious people at TCW. We're pushing people to be curious about other parts of the market as we break down these verticals and work more together, which leads me to the point on collaboration. We talked about earlier as the market structure shifts, we have to be able to be nimble and work together more, for example, across public and private markets. So that's a big part of what we're also building. And if you take all of those things together, that's where you build that environment of psychological safety or interpersonal risk. It's the humility that you get from being willing to learn from other people, but you have to have the other attributes first. And then you will build that environment of psychological safety. And that is when you get to a feedback culture, where people are really willing to tell each other what they feel honestly in a professional way to push each other to be better for our clients. So I'd like to rewind the clock to when you were first starting out. You grew up in suburban New Jersey. And I know that you grew up in a very close-knit family. So talk about some of the lessons you've learned from your parents. I did have this incredible advantage of having and continue to have such a great family. And I'm very close to my parents. My dad, as you know, unfortunately passed away about a decade ago. But both my dad and my mom left me with important life lessons that I pretty much draw on every day. So there are two simple ones. I'll spell them out. From my dad, it goes back to integrity, which is we do the right thing here in this family. Not the expedient thing, not the popular thing, not the easy thing. We do the right thing. And when you're running a company or team, whatever construct you want to say, life can get really complicated and you have to make a lot of decisions. You want to have that North Star because it makes it easier to get to the right answer for the clients and for the people and for the company. And we don't get every decision right, but we are coming at it. And I've been trained from when I was a very young child to come at it from what's the high integrity, what's the right thing to do here. And I really credit my dad with that. And it's just things that people might say, wow, that must have been a hard decision. You think, no, actually, it's really easy because it's inside here. And you do it for the long term too, which is tied to that. The second thing for my mom, I was a very earnest, overachieving child. Shocking. Very shocking. No, but when I say, I don't want to say that as, that came out wrong because that's saying it like I'm high. No, it's not. No, it's not. But not that I, because everyone has a benchmark, but I was keeping my benchmark low. So I was overachieving a low benchmark because I wasn't really pushing myself because I didn't want to fail. I really had a real aversion to failure. I wanted to be successful at everything I tried. So I would only try things that I knew I would succeed at, which is not actually a way to set yourself up for success. And my mom knew that. And so she really pushed me to do more. And she asked me this question that I think about before ever I make a big decision, which is what decision would you make if you knew you wouldn't fail? You can't use that to run portfolios. You need a different risk assessment for that. But in your own life, you should be pushing yourself always to ensure, I think particularly for a woman, that you're not held back by a fear of failure. And you are going to fail. I mean, I failed at a lot of things, but that's part of how you get to where you're going. And those two questions, what is the right thing to do here and what would you do if you wouldn't fail, really were very, very impressionable on me and I think have helped me a lot in life. Yeah, those are great lessons. So for college, you went to Notre Dame where you studied economics and literature. And I know you're very connected with the university. You sit on the university's board of trustees and on the advisory board of the Notre Dame Institute for Global Investing. So talk a little bit about what the school means to you. Well, it's obviously the best school in the United States of America. And my husband went there, so I kind of agree. Go Irish. And you're going to come out this fall to watch us beat USC, which is very exciting for me now that I live in LA. So there's a lot I could go on for a long time. So I'm going to keep this short. I think it helped me with two things. One is that it is a place because it's religious and has a Catholic identity that teaches you to believe in something bigger than yourself. Not that you have to do that through Catholicism. There are many ways to do that, but that is a good way to look at the world is that there are powers bigger than yourself and that you're building towards something that's more than just you. Whether you're thinking about that from a faith perspective, whether you're thinking about that from your family or running of a company, it's a good orientation to just believe in something bigger than yourself. And I really try and think about that with people we hire too. Is this someone who can contribute and believe in something bigger than themselves? And that was something I got taught to do at home, but also at Notre Dame. And the second is that it's a mission driven school. And I didn't fully realize this till I've actually, because you mentioned I was on the board. Now that I'm on the board, I've met the whole executive team and I've actually gotten to know them very well and they're extraordinary. So all of them could do these jobs at Fortune 100 companies, but they choose to do them in South Bend for Notre Dame. Now why? Because they believe in the Catholic mission of that school. Now I'm not changing TCW into a Catholic organization. That's not where this is headed. But it did make me realize like, wow, when people believe in the mission, tied to believing in something bigger than themselves, but really believe in the mission of what they're doing, you can extract incredible results from people and you can attract extraordinary talent that identifies with that mission. So I'm spending time on that. I'm thinking about how do we better articulate that for our industry and for TCW. And we're not going to get to the point of the Catholic church, obviously, but even if I could capture a little bit of that, I think it would be transformative for the way we speak to our clients, the way we manage our talent and the way we attract our talent. So you mentioned earlier that you have four children and what you didn't mention is that they're all under the age of 10. What are some of the lessons that you're hoping to pass on to them? The number one thing that my husband and I talk about is resilience. So life is really tough. It's hard. And we want them to be able to persist through the setbacks. And that there's that Maya Angelou quote to, you know, experience the defeats without being defeated. That's what we spend the most time on, because, I mean, you know, too, you went through the same thing on the East Coast, but we can create very privileged and sheltered lives for our children and we can solve so many of their problems and stresses. And in fact, I can do more of that if I wanted to do for my kids than my parents could do for me. But we're really setting them up for failure if we do that. And my husband went to West Point. He went through multiple deployments. I worked at Goldman Sachs for 20 years, which was amazing, as stated, but not always easy. We could agree on that. Which was tougher. Yeah. But there's setbacks, obviously, and it's tough and it's hard. And by the way, running a company like you're mostly dealing with problems. Right. So we talk about that, which is how do we instill some friction and make them understand that life is not always easy. And you know, it's interesting, you know this about us, but we moved to L.A. so I have these four kids. They're amazing. Have a great job at Goldman Sachs. I took the personal risk, and my husband was so supportive, of leaving Goldman, taking a new job, moving the family across the country. And I felt really guilty about doing that, but we did it. I was very proud for them, how they adapted. So that in and of itself builds some grit and resilience. And then we moved to the Pacific Palisades. And as you know, we, our community burned down in January of this year. And I wouldn't wish that upon anybody, obviously. It was obviously very difficult to go through. For me and for my kids, they were displaced, not just from their home, but their school. And I would say 80% of their friends lost their homes. So it was a really tough experience. And again, we would not wish that upon anyone. But my husband did quickly, you know, say to me, but we're here. So they get to go through this tough thing, but we're going to make sure that they're okay. And we have talked about the fact that you have to have these setbacks to get forward in life. And that helped me, it took some of the stress out of, the personal stress out of that experience for me. Like I had done something to fail my family by dragging them across the country and then having this horrible thing happen. It doesn't change that it was horrible, but it helped me frame it as this could be a growth experience for us. And I think it has been actually. And I don't want to be Pollyannish about it, but our kids have seen that bad things can happen to you, that you can come together and that you can survive it and that you are able to move forward. And I think that's a really powerful lesson for them. And you'll appreciate like even on a micro scale, like one thing that happened in the middle of this is my daughter wanted to try out for club soccer and we knew she wasn't going to make the team. I mean, I hope she doesn't listen to this podcast. She will, just so you know, she will, she may be 10 years from now, but she will. But we knew that that was unlikely. And I said to my husband, let's protect her from this experience. Like her community just burned out. She's unlikely to do this and he's like, no, it's okay. We're going to let her do it. She'll either make it or she won't. And she'll have either. It'll be great. She'll make the team or she'll have this experience of failure and we'll be there for her and we'll help her through it. Because by the way, it's going to happen a lot. Winning is easy. Losing is not. But losing is the most important thing, right, in investing her in life. So she did it and she did not make the team and she did survive, obviously. And I think it was a good experience for her and it has not stopped her from wanting to try to do new things. So that's what I would say we're the most intentional about, which is helping them. Again, winning is easy. How do we help them lose? How do we help them build resilience? Because you've managed thousands of people, right, over the years. Don't you think that's something that sets people apart? 100%. And that's what we want for them. And I think school can teach you some of that, but I think it's down to the parents to do that. So that's the number one lesson. Doesn't make you their best friend all the time, I'll say. You have to be willing to sacrifice kind of that part of it. And that is hard because, you know, we have limited time with our kids, right? So actually the easiest thing to do would be to remove all the friction and that limited time that you have with them. But actually you have to be the person to allow the discomfort and it takes extra work to help your kids learn how to lose and learn how to go through hardship. But I think it'll pay off. I don't know. It's the longest form of investing, right? As you said, they're young, so we won't know for 10 years. We know you did it well. Yours are older and they're great. I hope it works. I hope we're doing the right things. You are. I have a feeling 35 years from now, somebody will be interviewing your daughter and she'll say the same thing about being raised by a great family, a great close-knit family. I have a feeling. All right. So we like to end these things with a lightning round. So I'm going to run through a couple of questions, just get a quick answer from you. So what was your very first investment? Disney stock, which I was given for my first communion. And that was the first time I said, well, what is this? And I was explained what it meant to own part of a company. That's awesome. You spent a lot of time interviewing great investors on this very podcast, in addition to being one yourself. What would you say are the most important traits of being a great investor? The two most important traits are discipline, execution of philosophy and process, regardless of the environment that allows people to execute, particularly in environments like this. And the second is time. So you've made mistakes, try and make new ones, and you have pattern recognition. And the interesting thing about both of those are they are impossible to replicate. They just, they really are. They're actually pretty formidable competitive advantages. If you can find investors that are time-tested and have excellent discipline of philosophy and process, you're on to something advantageous. So what's the best piece of advice you've ever received? My dad used to say to me, you know, be yourself. Everybody else is taken. That's probably a quip he stole from someone else. No, but I like that. That's a good one. It is good. It's authenticity. And now that's more popular to be authentic. But you've done this longer than me. I kind of sometimes, especially being the only, wait, this is the lightning round actually. Exactly. That wasn't very short, but that's okay. But I like it. I'll leave that there. Be yourself because everyone else is taken. Everybody else is taken and just be authentic. And I think that's a very popular form of leadership now, but it was something I cultivated early because I was encouraged to do that. So which investor do you admire most? I'm going to say our TCW investors. And I said people with a lot of experience and extreme discipline. So I'm going to say Rick Miller, who runs private credit for us, and Brian Whelan, who's our CIO of Fixed Income. I admire them greatly. So where do you spend most of your time outside of the office, apart from being a mom to these four amazing children? I think that's it. That's all I do. You sleep. You sleep. I sleep. No, but I do every... When I'm not doing the work, I try and be with the kids a lot, but I'm starting to play golf. That's interesting. I don't want anyone looking up my index because I don't have one. I just started. But I'm getting out on the course more with my husband and with the kids. And that's my goal. That's great. And that's a good thing to do with the family. My goal is to be a bogey golfer. Wow. Also lets my kids see me be really bad at something. So going back to having the persistence to work through. I am trying. And LA is a great place to do that because the weather is great all year round. Yep. 75 and sunny. Yeah. And finally, what are you most excited about in the world right now? The uncertainty and the volatility. Amazing. This is our market. There's so many ways to add value for clients. And so this is actually, I think, just an extraordinary time to be in the business that I'm in. So Katie, thank you so much for joining me on this podcast. It was so much fun. It's a pleasure to have you back at Goldman Sachs and to spend this time with you. Thank you all for listening to this episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges Great Investors, which was recorded on Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025. I'm Alison Mass.

I'm Allison Aythen, and I'm here with George Lee, who is the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. Together, we're co-hosting a series of episodes exploring the rise of AI and everything it could mean for companies, investors, and economies. George, good to see you again. Good to see you, Allison. So, George, I'm eager to continue this conversation with you. I think this is our third conversation. It's our third. The first two have been great. I'm very much looking forward to this one as well. George, today we're going to discuss what the rise of AI could mean for U.S. tech giants and how investors are thinking about AI right now. But let me get your view first. Where do you see these tech giants fitting into the AI story right now? Well, I think it's important to note the time and date of our recording here. It's the afternoon of May 2nd. This has been sort of a momentous week. Many of the large technology companies have reported earnings, done earnings conference calls, and three themes emerged to me. One is that these big companies remain very committed to their capital spend, at least through the rest of 2025, to support AI workloads. Second, that they remain largely supply constrained in their ability to meet customer needs. And then third, Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, made an interesting comment that really landed with me where someone asked him, what inning are we in in this whole thing? And he said, we are first batter, second strike of the first inning. And so as a commentary on the novelty of this wave, the number of, the amount of territory ahead of us, I thought it was both amusing and important. Okay, interesting. All right, Eric, let's turn to you. Here with us to discuss these trends we have Eric Sheridan. Eric is the co-business unit leader of the technology media and telecommunications group in Goldman Sachs Research. Welcome, Eric. Great to be here. All right, Eric, your coverage actually spans a lot of perspectives on AI. So you cover the model builders, the model infrastructure providers, and many companies that just leverage the technology. And some companies, they actually do all three, right? Yes. And you've also talked a lot about a framework of generative AI evolution. I know we've had conversations about that. You've also had conversations about that with George. So when you look across that universe, where are we today? And I think the question on a lot of people's minds is who's garnering the most value from this technology today? And so what should investors therefore be focused on? Yes. So I think generally we've been on a journey that most computing shifts have followed. So we would argue that we're now in a third computing shift. The first one was Web 1.0. That was the adoption of desktop computing. The second was Web 2.0. That was mobile computing. We're in the later innings, to stick with the baseball analogy of mobile computing. Most people that can afford a smartphone have one. And there's been this thirst for what's the third wave of computing. AI, spatial computing, there are a lot of different elements that could play at it. But at the end of the day, it's basically elements of more machine learning, more AI, and different elements of devices that might merge the real world with the augmented world in a lot of ways, with a virtual assistant somewhat at the core of it. I think we're in the very early innings of this Web 3.0 phenomenon. And then when you think about just AI, we framed it as there's an infrastructure layer, there's a platform layer, there's an application layer. There actually has been an infrastructure platform and application layer for every computing shift. With this one, the infrastructure layer was building the large language models, training them, and building the foundations for AI. And we're now moving into the platform layer. And eventually, and we're in the very early innings of this, you'll see an application layer. And the application will play out in your consumer computing and your enterprise computing. So, there'll be ways in which you interact with AI at work from a business perspective, and there's gonna be a way you interact with AI in your own personal life from your consumer computing needs, not dissimilar to the way it is now. You have a desktop at work, you have a phone at work, and then you leave the office and you have a mobile phone and a laptop and a tablet and all these things from a form factor standpoint in your day-to-day life. We have proven out that the large language models can scale, and each iteration of them is a little bit better from a benchmarking standpoint than the one before. We haven't quite got to AGI, which would be the end state of AI in a lot of ways, generative AI. But where we're at right now is we're starting to evolve into deep research, reasoning. The models are starting to think and iterate, and that will actually add more robustness to the application layer over time. So, if you use any of these consumer apps in your day-to-day life, a Gemini or a ChatGPT, they're very different today than they were even just a year ago. And it's interesting to me because you've talked about these three phases. And to me, when I first hear that, I think these phases will happen over decades. And yet, one thing that keeps coming up on these conversations is how quickly we now are into this second phase. So, we say early innings, but, I mean, the speed of this has been pretty incredible. Yeah. I mean, you could argue that people started acquiring spectrum and building mobile networks and talking about smartphones somewhere in the 2005, 2006 era. And around 2012, 2013 was when companies like Google and Facebook at the time called themselves mobile first. That took eight or nine years. People forget, November of 2022, in the beginning of that month, most people on this planet had never heard of ChatGPT. So, we are two and a half years into this cycle. ChatGPT already has over 800 million monthly active users. Gemini is now preloaded on most Samsung phones on the planet. And a lot of this is happening in very quick order. It is extraordinary. I often talk about this time dilation phenomenon of how change seems to be accelerating in this way versus many of the others that you cited. Let's go back to the CapEx question that I teased a little bit in my opener. As you saw, the companies basically reiterated their commitment to 2025 CapEx, but there are real questions about how that will look into 2026 and beyond. How are you thinking about that? What's the duration of this enormous capital investment? How do you see it playing out? Yeah. So, we are in the third year of what I'll call the investment cycle from a capital standpoint. You are now at peak capital intensity defined by CapEx over revenue in these business models. For example, Meta is now approaching 40% capital intensity. CapEx is defined by revenue. We think there's one more year where capital intensity can stay at these levels, but that would bring the growth rate down from growth rates of 40, 50, 60% this year more into the mid-teens next year. But it's an interesting point, George. We've been on quite a journey just this year. In January, we thought 2026 CapEx would grow mid-teens and most investors were like, that's way too low. Then DeepSeek happened four, six weeks later and all of a sudden the numbers were way too high. And then DeepSeek recedes into the background and some of these AI applications start to build in scale and all of a sudden they're too low again. So, we've already been through three market iterations of AI in this year alone, only with respects to one year forward CapEx. With respect to this year, as you pointed out, we think the companies are relatively settled in what they're going to spend. These spend levels were a result of detailed business planning processes that occurred from October to January. We think they're very unlikely to change because of the macro environment because they're being aimed at multi-year themes. Next year, this is the way we would characterize it, mid-teens type growth. But beyond that, you start to get into the scaling of applications. You need the proof points for investors to be on board with these levels of spend continuing. Let me just follow up on a quick point you made though, because obviously the macro environment has been quite volatile and tariffs. I've got to ask you about tariffs, Eric, because it's on everyone's mind. Is that not having an impact? You just said, no, it's not impacting these capital spending plans at this point. So I break this into two pieces and I think Meta this week was a really interesting earnings report. They raised their CapEx and lowered their OpEx guidance. And the messaging coming out of the company was we continue to find ways to find efficiencies inside the organization, but we are not at a point where we want to sacrifice long duration investments, mostly articulated through CapEx, just because the macro environment could look a certain way for three, six or nine months. I'm not trying to be dismissive of the macro environment, but it's interesting. The last time we had a full really recessionary environment, the U.S. was the great financial crisis, 07, 08, 09. Most of these companies that existed at the time regret pulling back on long duration investments during those times of U.S., those CEOs and CFOs. So I think the macro will end up with more volatility on operating expenses. That's headcount, that's marketing spend, that's very, very long duration projects. But I think given the sheer number of players investing both offensively and defensively at AI, I think this spend will get protected for a little longer than the macro environment might influence it. There's one other thing I may jump in on there, because you're raising meta, I think is super instructive. One of the reasons why they suggested that they were raising their CapEx guidance did relate to tariffs, because they actually said, look, there are going to be some embedded costs in acquiring the material necessary to build these data center footprints. So that's one way in which tariffs are first order, getting drawn into this CapEx. It's just a cost of goods sold issue, right? At the end of the day, there are parts and widgets that are in the capital expenditure budget that are coming from other places of the world that have to be shipped here that would be subject to tariffs. Even if you don't change the rate of spend or the capacity you need, the input costs can go up as a result of tariffs. So that was an interesting nuance this earnings period. I think one other thing I reflected on in this earnings cycle was the degree to which some of the model providers and infrastructure providers are benefiting endogenously in their businesses. And so, Meta talked about the ability of the AI that they're building, not only to benefit customers, but to benefit their own targeting, their own engagement. I think we're seeing the same thing from Google. May talk a little bit about that effect. Yeah, I think it's an interesting way to capture it. Mark Zuckerberg led off the Meta call laying out the five pillars of where they want to go as a company. It was a really interesting articulation of where he wants to go against the themes of AI and spatial computing. But it was really interesting. The first four of those five pillars were all aimed at internal productivity efficiency gains, making their products better, and then bringing their products from an adoption curve standpoint to clients in a faster, more efficient manner. And the last one was the Meta goggles, which the glasses get a lot of press coverage and they get a lot of exposure. But at the end of the day, while that is a chunky part of operating losses in the business today against the 10-year theme, the vast majority of this AI was aimed at those first four pillars. And the CFO at Meta was very adamant, we need more capacity for those first four pillars today because people are adopting our products at a higher rate. One example of this, and it's true for Alphabet as well, the automation of advertising. Alison and I have talked about this in the past. This is a real world example where AI is creating ads, placing ads, measuring ads, taking all the data from that transaction, processing it, and repeating that process billions of times. And advertising is becoming more efficient, return on ad spend is going up, and then there's more dollars to spend to earn return targets in the broader economy. That's a distinct example that they pointed to. Fascinating. So, sort of a related topic, you mentioned Alphabet. You know, one of the most fiercely debated questions in this transition is the future of search. And many people posit that chatbots will cannibalize search volumes. Now, Google and Alphabet's results seem to defy that thus far. How do you think that's going to play out? Will new ad units emerge that are suitable for chatbots? Will network effects emerge in that world, the things that have driven the extraordinary growth of advertising, search advertising at Alphabet? What's your take on that one? This is one of the most hotly debated topics. Generally, I would say what I'm always amazed by is when investors say, well, search from November 2022 was losing share the day chatGBT started, as if there isn't 20 years of search. I have a slide that I show investors of what I call the eras of search will die, right? Amazon was going to kill Google, mobile apps were going to kill Google, your iPhone was going to kill Google. At one point, Alta Vista was going to kill Google, if there's anyone as old as me that's listening or watching this. So at the end of the day, there are a lot of iterations of what will happen with search and search itself. It's almost treated by investors as if it's been a inorganic product. Twenty years ago, you would do a search and there'd be 10 blue links. Now you do a search, there's a map, there's graphical representations, there's a shopping carousel. Search has changed, search will continue to change. In the last six months alone, Alphabet has introduced AI overviews, AI mode, Gemini is an interface on desktop and as a standalone app. And by the way, the number one thing when we track data that has happened since chatGBT emerged is human beings are querying computers at a higher rate than they ever have. The pie of us asking computers questions has exploded. That's all that's really happened. The monetization of those commercial queries still resides predominantly with Google. We don't see any change in that today. But I can't be naive about this. I have to be mindful of where it could go going forward. But today, we have seen very little impact on commercial search queries. And one point you often make, Eric, that I think is important is this is about consumer behavior, right? I mean, it's very hard to change behavior. People dismiss it. But people are used to searching and they will continue to use it. I mean, that is something that you've often said. computing behavior, most people upgrade their phone every three, four, five years. Yet the leading bloggers on technology trends have a new phone in their pocket every two months. The vast majority of billions of people on this planet don't have a new phone in their pocket every couple of months. They're not trying every laptop that's sold at market. Most habits take decade plus to play out as opposed to playing out in any six or 12-month increment. So let's talk about investors right now in terms of sentiment. We have obviously gone through a few waves of this. There was nothing but AI craze at one point not too long ago. Then there was a lot of skepticism as we've been talking about in terms of the amount of capex. Is it too much? Will these companies be able to extract value and returns from that capex? And now given all this volatility, it's really unclear where they are. What are you observing in terms of investor sentiment today? Yep. I almost think of this as pre-tariff and post-tariff narrative in the market. And the tariff narrative is a bit above my qualification. So I'll put a pin in that for a second. Towards the end of last year, I think investors were starting to get it right. The infrastructure layer had somewhat peaked in terms of rate of change from an investment cycle. And I think investors were generally moving from the arms dealers and how you deploy dollars to build against each other towards what have you built and how is it going to scale? The initial pivot was towards the hyperscalers. I cover AWS inside of Amazon and Google Cloud inside Alphabet. My colleague and partner in crime, Cash Rangan, covers Microsoft, which has Azure. Those three businesses got a lot of attention from investors and a lot of incremental focus on the rate of revenue growth and the rate of potential for reacceleration of revenue growth. For example, in this last week or week and a half alone, Google Cloud grew 28%, AWS grew 17%, Microsoft Azure grew well into the 30s. Those are the type of growth rates that attacked a lot of investor attention because there's a direct correlative payout. I spent a dollar of CapEx and Goldman Sachs as a client wants to experiment with AI and they pay their cloud provider for more workloads. That is now playing out in real time. The to-be-continued piece or the to-be-determined piece is the consumer AI application piece. There are about six applications competing to be the app on your phone, Allison, that will be your AI assistant. ChatGPT has got an early lead in that field. Google Gemini is trying to play catch up. But even this week alone, Meta announced a standalone Meta AI. Alexa is an app that Amazon is going to push as a consumer pivot. And then there's some private companies like Claude and Perplexity on the branded side as well. So there's a heated competition to be AI assistant on the consumer side, but the workloads and the enterprise dynamic is where investor focus has heavily skewed. Now, I would argue the broader AI narrative has been disrupted by the tariff talk in the market. So even on a night where Amazon reported yesterday, and I've been on the phone with investors most day on Amazon, probably less than 20% of my conversations have been about AWS because most people are trying to figure out how the largest e-commerce company in the world is going to navigate through the tariff landscape. So the narrative moved away from AI rather than the AI narrative continued to shift. Absolutely. I mean, we're all finding tariffs dominating all of our conversations. Absolutely. So Eric, you and I are both veterans of this game in some ways. What can we learn from prior cycles? And you've talked even just in short duration, how volatile investor sentiment is around this. What's different? What's the same this time around? I'm struck that while there's all this attention and heat and investor focus, public companies by and large trade at reasonable multiples. How does this compare to prior cycles you and I have lived through? I would say there's two distinct differences that are notable to me. Number one, alphabet one year forward trades below a market multiple. Meta one year forward roughly trades on top of the market multiple. You typically don't see the technology companies at the forefront of a technology shift trading at or below one year forward market multiples. Not that there aren't names that trade well above it, but that is a very big difference. If we went back to 2000, there weren't even multiples. Like everything was trading as a multiple of revenue or a multiple of market opportunity. It was a very different world. Also, the other dynamic is typically most technology shifts, the incumbents lose and a new set of players arise. The more interesting dynamic here is the sheer scale of capital on the balance sheets of the incumbents allows them to invest the way we're talking about. Just to give some quick numbers, Alphabet is going to spend $75 billion on CapEx this year. Meta is probably going to spend approaching $70 billion and Amazon's going to spend somewhere between $100 and $110 billion of CapEx. Collectively, that's over $250 billion of CapEx. We could probably count on a very short piece of paper how many companies have a $250 billion market cap globally, let alone can spend $250 billion of capital against a growth initiative. So you have the biggest companies almost living in fear of being disrupted and deploying capital to play as much offense as they're playing defense, where if you go back to the first makers of smartphones or mobile phones, they ended up getting disrupted by smartphone manufacturers that came up and sort of overran them by being more innovative. Those two things are very different than prior cycles. What's not different, and I say this with all due respect to all the clients I love talking to every day, investors are impatient. If these things take more than an earning cycle, or if there's a slight hiccup or there's a slight disruption, then narratives can lose momentum very, very quickly. The number of investors that are saying no matter what happens over the next three or four quarters, I'm going to look through all of this over the next five years is probably the smallest it's ever been. So if you look at those differences and that similarity, what is your main takeaway here for investors? I think we're at the cusp of the application layer being proven out, and then we're going to have to figure out who the winners and losers are on the application side. I think we know who has the scale of capital to deploy foundational models and move from training to inference. I think we know mostly what platforms will be built on top of those foundational models. What remains uncertain is what applications will play out. And frankly, not to hearken back to Web 2.0, and I say this a lot with investors, it was perfectly acceptable to stand on a New York City street corner and raise your hand and hail a taxi until Uber came along. It was perfectly fine to stay in a hotel until Airbnb came along. Sometime the application layer is where the most outsized return and the most unique differentiation of change of behavior actually takes place. Fascinating. Eric, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. Great discussion as always. Alison, I just have to say I'm struck by what a thoughtful and grounded observer Eric is around this stuff. So it's great to have you here, have you at the firm and have this discussion with you. And I think it's also just a fascinating reflection of the amount of conviction being exhibited by these large companies, that quantum of capital that Eric talked about, and yet the variation around investor sentiment, around our own natural skepticism about the rate of change, the import of this shift, just fascinating kind of contrast of views. And I look forward to many more episodes with you as we sort of watch this all play out over time. Me too. Well, George, it's been great as always talking to you. Thank you. Great to be here.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-05-02 17:26:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Stagflation and the Fed's next move\n**Episode ID:** 4497\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nAs the U.S. economy faces a stagflationary shock, how will the Fed navigate this tricky environment? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. My guest today is Rob Kaplan, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and the former president of the Dallas Fed. Rob, welcome back to the program. Good to see you, Alison. So Rob, there is so much to talk about today, but of course, there is a lot of concern that the U.S. is headed for a stagflation shock, which is notoriously difficult for monetary policymakers to deal with. So first of all, let's just get your view. Do you think that we are facing stagflation ahead? We are facing most likely slower growth and stickier prices. So I guess that might be the definition of stagflation. And there's several reasons why, not just tariffs. We're right now in the middle of an effort to cut government spending and lower deficits. So it's a question mark how effective it's going, but that would normally slow growth. You've got a regulatory review in every industry that should help growth, but it might take a year or two. You've got immigration flows due to deportations. Immigration and flow of workforce is decelerating, is declining. Workforce growth helps growth. We're accustomed to one to two million workers per year over the last eight years, including in the first Trump administration. It looks like it could be in the low hundreds of thousands this year. That makes growth lower, makes the job force in the service sector stickier. And then you've got tariffs, which should slow growth and provide a cost shock. But we don't know how much of a cost shock, because we don't know what the tariff levels are. So if you wrap it all together, it makes sense that growth is going to slow and prices are likely to be stickier. We just don't know how much. So how does the Fed weigh these risks of slower growth, but higher inflation? We have a FOMC meeting coming up. What will the conversation be like in the Eccles Building? So the smartest thing the Fed could do, and if I were in my former seat, agree what you know and acknowledge what you don't know. And right now, the things you don't know are significant. I don't know what the tariff levels are going to be. We haven't announced any of these trade levels yet. I do know that immigration growth is slowed and workforce growth is slower. And I know what they're trying to do with the government. So what I would say is the soft data, I know that's weaker. But so far, other than travel, leisure, shipping, those are clearly soft. But the hard data or otherwise is kind of hanging in there. And inflation at the moment is kind of hanging around in the mid twos. But I know we're about to get a cost shock. And so the smartest thing you do with this amount of uncertainty is kick the can. They won't be prepared to act in May. And then they'll take with a clean sheet of paper for June and then figure out as they get into the June meeting. So what's the puzzle look like now? And so don't try to prejudge. Don't be rigid. Don't be predetermined and realize there's a puzzle, but you don't know what the pieces are yet. And so I'd be careful about making public comments on what you will or won't look through because you don't know. And I'd be careful about talking about dates like June meeting versus July meeting. I would be aware of that. And then the last thing they have to do is realize inflation expectations in the surveys are getting unanchored. Okay. And so you need to at least jawbone a little tougher and remind people you haven't given up your fight on inflation. And that's why you've heard Jay Powell in his speech in Chicago a couple of weeks ago sound a little tougher. It's not that he's not prepared to lower rates down the road, but he doesn't want inflation expectations to become unanchored. So you basically think the Fed sits tight here. In May. In May. Watches. Waits. And that's the message they've been given. I mean, they've basically said, we will wait to see how this evolves and how the data evolves and we'll go from there. So they could not cut at all this year or they could cut by a lot. Yeah. And what Jay's going to try to do, his big opportunity is in the press conference then. I think he'll try to sound balanced, even handed, but also keep their options open and be clear that they're still very focused on not just worrying about higher unemployment, but also fighting inflation. I think you'll hear that from him in the press conference. So I'm going to pivot here, Rob. The last time we spoke, we had discussed concerns about Fed independence. You were the head of the Dallas Fed during Trump's term. And when I asked you about that originally, you said, look, on the supervisory side, yes, you can feel some political pressure, but on the operational side, in terms of interest rates and how they're managing monetary policy decisions, you didn't feel that during Trump 1.0. Obviously, this rhetoric around Fed independence has ramped up. Have your views at all evolved since we last spoke about this? So between now and the end of Jay Powell's term, I think the Fed will fight and strive around the table to be making decisions that are divorced from political pressures and political considerations. I think the issue will be whoever the new head of the Fed is going to be. I think it's very important for that person, whoever he or she is, to be seen to not have made any pre-commitments to the administration about what they will or won't do. And I think there's probably some creeping skepticism out there whether that will be the case. That'll be a challenge for the next Fed chair. But I think as long as Jay Powell is in the seat and with this cast of folks around this FOMC table, I think you may hear from one or two some comments that I think would be wiser not to make. But with the exception of that, I think they're going to strive to make whatever they think is the best decision to create full employment price stability without regard to political pressures. And it's an important point you just made there that I think sometimes gets unappreciated, which is it's around the table. There are many members of the FOMC, and Chair Powell and the chair in general has one vote. So how does that work if we think about the potential scenarios? How much influence can a chair have relative to everyone around the table? So in a typical meeting, remember, there's seven governors, and then you have a rotating group of presidents who vote. And so normally a Fed chair doesn't want more than a couple of dissents. Maybe you could live with three dissents. So you need to keep a consensus around the table. There has been a tendency historically for the governors to not dissent, although we've had a couple this year. But yeah, Jay has to build a consensus of the group and get people on the same page. And so part of his job is to assess the group, give his own views, but he can't cut rates or raise rates or act by himself. He has to get the view of the group. And so this is part of the reason why there are two reasons why I think you didn't see any action recently. One, I think there's already some concern around the world about the institutional framework of the United States and willingness to invest in the dollar and buy duration. I think replacing a Fed chair before his or her term are over would undermine some of that confidence. That's one reason not to do it. And then the second point is, even if Jay Powell weren't there, the remaining people around the FOMC table are going to strive to be true to what they believe and operate without regard to political pressure or influence. And I think you'll get the same results whether he's chair or not. Right. Interesting. So it just wouldn't be that effective in achieving the administration's goals. I don't think so. Interesting. Okay. So a lot of uncertainty. We don't know what the Fed will do because we don't know what tariffs and other policies are going to do. Right. Do you say to investors who are asking you, what does this mean and how should I respond and react and navigate all of this? So we go through a couple of things. One, I talk about the broad framework of all the structural changes that are going on. The other thing I talk about is how this affects the U.S., but how it affects outside the U.S. And this is where there's a divergence. We've got to remember, for most countries around the world, they're fighting a trade war with only one country. So the United States is fighting a trade war broadly. It means our companies are struggling to figure out how to realign their supply chains and logistics and they're somewhat hesitant to domicile more in the United States unless they think it will be globally competitive. And so outside the U.S., this tariff change is likely a growth shock, might in fact be disinflationary in that we have overcapacity in goods around the world, just not in the United States with these tariffs, but we will in other countries. And so it might in fact be clear for their central banks, they may have more latitude to cut rates, maybe do fiscal stimulus. United States is a little bit, not the only country, but kind of unique in that we're likely to have an issue with supply of goods and we may have some issues with supply of workers because of what we're doing on immigration. So we're the one country that will have a growth shock, potentially negative, but also a cost shock. Other countries around the world may have a little more clarity and latitude on how to manage this. And so that's another thing we talk with global investors about. Right. So are you essentially saying, you know, look abroad, look abroad in a way that we haven't been looking because the U.S. has performed so well and outperformed substantially? I still think the U.S. exceptionalism thesis, it's got a few chinks in it. And in particular, the chinks come from people questioning, does our institutional framework in the U.S., is it still in place? That includes terrific companies, very innovative companies, higher education, innovation, science research was part of that bedrock rule of law, free speech. There's maybe a few questions being asked. I think today, as you and I are sitting here, Meta and Microsoft just announced earnings last night. I think that's a reminder to people around the world, you know, the U.S. exceptionalism thesis, that's a key part of it. And you'll notice today, dollar strengthening, gold selling off, 10 year actually rallying a little bit. It kind of reminds people, OK, that's the reason why, you know, I was so heavily allocated to dollar denominated assets. So those kinds of things help. And my big hope is, as we come out of this two or three years, you want to come out of this period with U.S. exceptionalism thesis intact. We don't do everything perfectly, but our institutional framework is intact. Our global competitiveness is intact. Our great, innovative, superb companies are intact. And that's my hope for the next few years. But in the near term, there have been a few chinks in it that have caused people to, on the margin, allocate a little more away from the dollar. Right. Which you think is warranted. But we'll see. I share your hope. Yeah, it's warranted, but it's not a wholesale reallocation. So we're fortunate. There are stages to park outside the U.S., but at the moment, from what I've observed, it feels more like parking than high conviction investing. Whereas when people are investing in the U.S., I think it was more high conviction investing because a lot of these exceptional attributes, they're still... That pull is not gone. I think we have to make sure to preserve it. I think everyone would agree that it's very hard to have high conviction today. Thanks again, Rob, for joining us. Thanks, Alison. Good to talk to you.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-29 04:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How AI and geopolitics are reshaping cybersecurity\n**Episode ID:** 4498\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nAmid a relatively soft deal-making environment, one bright spot this year has been the surge in cybersecurity deals. So what's fueling activity in this space, and how are factors such as AI and rising geopolitical tensions affecting the industry? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. To discuss the forces shaping cybersecurity, I'm sitting down with Marco Poletti, Global Head of Securities Software within the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications group in our investment banking business. Marco, welcome back to Exchanges. It's great to be here. So Marco, the cybersecurity sector is one of the few that's actually seen a pickup in M&A activity this year. We've seen a number of deals, including Google's largest ever acquisition to purchase cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion. What are some of the drivers behind deal activity in the space? You know, it's a good question. I would say the reality is security is just really important. And because it's really important, it's really important to a lot of potential buyers. And so when I look at what's been going on in the last few years, the, call it the universe of buyers that we have in cybersecurity has really expanded. Last year, for example, we also advised MasterCard on their acquisition of Recorded Future, which was a threat intelligence company. And so when I think of what's going on, it's really, I would say two or three main factors. The first one is, it's just a much more dangerous world. When you think about the number of cyber attacks, there's just more and more of them and it just keeps on coming. And so that means we need better security. I think the second thing is cybersecurity is really viewed as a competitive advantage now. And so if you're Google, if you're Microsoft, if you're those big tech companies, being viewed as focused on security is really critical to keep winning in your call markets. And the third thing which I would say, which we have seen in cybersecurity is the idea of platformization, meaning having one vendor that does a lot more of things. And that means usually doing that through M&A, which has been a fuel to our business. And so are there certain sectors that are seeing more activity and what's driving that activity? Yeah, I would say when you look at the activity in M&A and cybersecurity, you kind of have to follow innovation. And so where we've seen a lot of activity in the last few years and in the last few months is everything on cloud security. You were talking about the Wiz transaction. I would say everything on security operations. So security operations, meaning how you help companies actually deal with security issues and remedy them. That's been a really important theme. Lots of M&A that we've already seen, a lot more that I expect to come. And another big thing has been AI. Obviously, as you may expect, AI is transforming everything in tech and software. And so it's also transforming security. It's interesting because there's a couple of themes there. The first one is how you can use AI for better security outcomes, but then also how security needs to adapt to secure AI. That's a very new theme, but I do expect you'll see a lot of M&A coming out of that. And the other topic I would highlight there is cybersecurity is an industry where we have seen a lot of financial sponsor and private equity activity. And that's really a cycle that I expect will keep on going, given how critical, sticky and relevant the industry is. And that will just fuel more M&A going forward. Right. And so do you see the pace of these transactions picking up? How do you view the pipeline from here? I mean, look, the pipeline is as high as it's ever been. Again, when you look at dry powder from private equity firms, it's as high as it's ever been. And so they need to deploy that capital. They also own a lot of assets today that will need to find a home, be that in the public markets or through M&A in the next few quarters and years. And when I look at the large strategic environment we were talking about earlier, I think there's a ton more to do. I think there's a ton more to do to keep being relevant to customers. And so the pipeline just keeps on going. And is that also the case for IPOs? What is the IPO market looking like? It's a good question. It is a moment in time where I would say normal market conditions, the IPO pipeline for security looks really good. We have a number of really high quality companies that have really great characteristics around growth, really disrupting their markets that we think public investors will love at the right time. But look, we live in an uncertain period. And I was talking about this earlier. I think it's going to be the next few quarters. It's harder to predict your own business, right? I think it's harder to figure out what will work and not work with public investors. And a lot of the companies that were planning to go public in the next few quarters are maybe putting a bit of a pose on and seeing, well, what's happening in the macro? What's happening to the economy? How does that translate to my business? And therefore, when is the right time to go public? Now I'll tell you, when the IPO market is not working, the M&A market is working very well. And so I think it will be interesting to see in the next few quarters what happens and how long this uncertainty we're in continues, because it could actually end up resulting in more M&A, because those really great companies will need to do something. And if we think about that uncertainty and how it's impacting the industry more broadly, is it affecting companies' willingness to spend on cybersecurity? What are you seeing on the ground? As of April 2025, from talking to a lot of my clients, I don't think the impact is widespread, at least yet. And I think there's a couple of reasons for that. The first one is, frankly, if you look at what happened in 2022, 2023, when we already had a recession, cybersecurity actually fared better than other industries and even other software verticals. And the reason for that is, if you think about it, the reality of the cybersecurity spend is you're spending to protect yourself. And if you decide to not spend into something, and suddenly you have a breach, that's a really bad day for you as an employee of any type of company. And so it tends to be a lot more sticky than other categories. I think that will continue in the new period that we're in. It will be harder to go into new markets, to go into new products, just because it's going to be a lot harder for your customers to decide to spend more with you. But I do think they'll keep the spend that they have with you. And we're talking about the current environment for the moment. Are the government funding cuts, are they having an impact here? When you look at the typical targets of cybersecurity, by targets, I mean, from a customer perspective for the cybersecurity companies, governments across the world have always been a very important customer base. And they're not only an important customer, but for a lot of the cybersecurity companies, they're actually a partner, because you need to partner with the government to find out what the bad guys are doing. And that's really the way you protect not just companies, but also national security. And so the long term relationship between cybersecurity and the government is going to continue. I have a few examples of some of our clients who have really great customers that are going to remain customers for years, but there's no budget right now. And no one really knows where the budget is. So I think it goes back to the theme of having temporary uncertainty that's weighing on near term growth. But I don't think any of that, at least for cybersecurity, will really impact the long term relationship with the government as a customer. Right. And as you said, there is a need and a growing need for cybersecurity. If you think about the trends that you're seeing in terms of things like cybercrime, how are they evolving? And how do you think about that in the context of the geopolitical tensions that we have today? Yeah, look, sadly, more conflicts, more geopolitical issues typically means more attacks. And so the more tensions you have in the system, the more that will translate in more attacks. And, you know, what's interesting is those attacks are not necessarily from nation states. You also have people that are just literally trying to earn a living by being cybercriminals. And so that trend, unfortunately, I think will just continue, which makes cybersecurity even more relevant than it's ever been. Interesting. Right. I mean, when you think of cyber, bad actors, political, but there's a lot of other things. I mean, when you look at all of those phishing links and everything, you know, someone telling you that you haven't paid something and asking you to click on the link, that's not coming from a nation state. That's just someone trying to scam you. Right. Of course. And scams are up. We all know, personally, scams are up. Hopefully you don't click on that. But yeah, look, that's one of the reasons why it's fascinating to, I'm really lucky to have my job, because when you think about what's going on in cybersecurity, innovation just cannot stop because really what cybersecurity does, it is protecting you in context of newer things that you use and in context of newer ways that the attackers have of attacking you. So in the personal side of things, if you start using a new messaging app, for example, that's a new attack vector. And you need to be protected against that. And we also need to figure out that the way that bad guys use that, you also protect against that. And so there was a big wave of innovation that was related to enterprises moving to the cloud. Cloud was a huge new attack surface that needed to be protected. And so now a lot of people are talking about Gen AI as being that new platform on which the next wave of innovation in tech is going to be built. That's going to be a huge attack surface. And so, again, I think that really creates more attacks, that creates more needs to protect against new things. And so that creates more need for cybersecurity. There's obviously been a lot of talk right now around spending in defense and innovation in defense technology. Where does spending on cybersecurity capabilities feature when you think about defense tech innovation? Yeah, that's a truly fascinating area. Because when you look at all of the innovation in cybersecurity, it's been mostly B2B. And so it's been really mostly an enterprise and commercial aspect. When you look at CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, all those companies are really protecting enterprises. But when you look at where innovation in cybersecurity is coming from, a big market for cybersecurity is Israel. And one of the things that Israel has done amazingly well is essentially using the experience of a bunch of people that went to the army and that went to a unit where they were essentially fighting against cybercriminals. And then they use that experience to create companies, startups, like Wiz, that just became amazing at what they do and amazing at protecting enterprises. And so I think what we're seeing in that new wave of defense tech and companies, both in the U.S. but also, frankly, in Europe, that are finding new ways of just supplying the defense governments, cybersecurity is critical in that. Because one, you actually have to make sure that whatever you build is protected. When you think about a bunch of unmanned devices that talk to each other, that go and target in a very far away, those things need to be protected. You can't have that, you know, you don't want a missile to be hacked. And so embedding cybersecurity in those things is really important. But then there's also some really interesting themes about how you use cybersecurity in a bigger way to go against who you're targeting. And that's always been what the government has been doing. There's obviously new tools that are available now. I don't think that really impacts the enterprise business and, you know, the market value of cybersecurity. But I think it's really critical for national security. Right. And if you think about the biggest threats in cybersecurity that you're watching, and, you know, perhaps some of the solutions to those risks, what do you find most interesting? Yeah, I probably would highlight two things. The first one is Gen AI. Because when you think about Gen AI, it's really more from the attacker's perspective. You don't need to know how to write code to launch an attack anymore. And so that's a really big risk. And then if you take that one step forward, true AI, meaning if you have a self-aware bot that's in a system that knows when to detonate or not detonate, if you're in a sandbox, that's actually really scary. And frankly, that's the world that we're heading into. So I think that's issue number one. Issue number two, frankly, is user fatigue. And you and I are going through many cybersecurity trainings. We know what we should click on, should not click on. But the idea of user fatigue in a world where there's so much data that comes our way, it's really tricky sometimes to not click on something if you think it's really real. So I think those are the two big issues for companies now. And so when you think about some of the solutions, there's a lot of really amazing things being done right now around what I'd call human security or how you protect humans and what humans do rather than servers or things that sit in the cloud. So that's really interesting. And then everything around Gen AI, look, it's really immature in cybersecurity right now, because if you think about what security protects, we don't really know what Gen AI will mean for enterprises five or 10 years from now. And I think we'll need to know really what it looks like before cybersecurity becomes real. You kind of need to know what you have to protect before you start protecting it. But the same way that Gen AI is a bit risk, Gen AI will be great to fight those new risks that are created by the same technology. Interesting. Thank you so much, Marco, for joining us.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-25 04:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How insurers are navigating volatile markets\n**Episode ID:** 4499\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nAs one of the largest investors in the world, insurers can have an outsized impact on markets and investment flows. So how are they approaching today's volatile markets? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. For today's episode, I'm sitting down with Goldman Sachs' Mike Siegel, Global Head of the Insurance Asset Management and Liquidity Solutions business, and Matt Armis, Global Head of Insurance Asset Management, to discuss how insurers are managing their portfolios and why it matters for markets and economies. Mike, Matt, welcome back to the program. Thank you. Thank you for having us. This has been an annual event the last few years, so looking forward to the conversation. So Mike, this is clearly a very tricky market environment for all kinds of investors, but does this environment pose any particular challenges for insurers? Alison, this is a tricky environment. We've seen tricky environments before. It does pose challenges for the insurers, but it also poses quite significant opportunities. When you look at the typical insurance company balance sheet, they are underweight relative to others' equities. So the equity market volatility is concerning, but not damaging to their capitalization. That's number one. Number two, the life companies in particular do offer out equity-sensitive products. So that creates more of a hedging need for them. They're very adept at that, but I'm sure with the markets whipsawing around, that's creating a lot of work on the hedging front. With regard to the rest of the balance sheet, which is typically fixed income instruments, there's two aspects to that. One, what are government rates doing? And to the extent that they are rising, that can be a benefit, but also we see a divergence in government rates around the world, which is also creating some opportunities to maybe sell into this market and buy in that market. But the other thing is the credit spread itself, and slow increases in credit spreads tend to be a very good thing because insurers always have cash or liquidity to put to work. As they write new premiums, as interest comes in off of bonds, as bonds mature, where do I put that money? And if I'm in a higher rate environment, that tends to be a benefit. Now, if credit spreads really move out quite substantially, it might be signaling something else that credit itself is deteriorating. And overall, that's not a good thing. And Mike, you've just published your annual insurance survey. So remind us what that entails. Thanks, Allison. This is the 14th year that we've published the survey. It's a survey of insurers globally. This year we had a record turnout. We had over 400 companies respond to our survey, managing over $13 trillion of balance sheet assets, which represents about half of the industry's asset base. We called the survey the Great Pivot, which represents the pivot from public markets, public assets, to private markets, private assets, which I'm sure we're going to discuss further. Right. So Matt, let's talk about this a bit more. When we talked last year at this time, insurers were generally feeling much better about the economy. I think we all were feeling pretty good about the economy. And as Mike said, insurers are just this rare asset class that actually likes high interest rates. They were worried about interest rates falling. I imagine the conversation is just very different right now. It is very different right now than it was last year. And we can start with when we took the survey and we're talking to insurers, that was after the inauguration, but before the first tariff shock in February. And even then, insurers tell us that they were already preparing the portfolios for higher inflation. So they were worried about inflation accelerating. They were worried about a slowdown, particularly in the United States. And they were worried about volatility. So even before the event really kicked off in February and then accelerated here in March and April, insurers were already preparing for an environment not dissimilar than where we are today. So versus last year, the concerns around inflation, the concerns around recession were already growing. And insurers were looking for asset allocation choices that would help be defensive in an environment where you start to worry about inflation, you start to worry about recession. So while it's different, and it is different versus last year, I do think the industry was already starting to prepare their portfolios for an environment that could be a little bit more tumultuous. So how are insurers adjusting their asset allocation strategies amid this uncertainty and this volatility in the markets? And this is where the pivot really originates from. We looked at the survey, and they were concerned about inflation. They were concerned about growth. But what we saw was this strong interest towards private assets, the strong interest in going from public investment-grade corporate debt into its private equivalent, investment-grade private credit, or going from high-yield debt into its private equivalent. And we think that was very much part of this preparing the portfolio for a more defensive position, a more resilient posture, by using the liquidity that they have on the balance sheet, using the excess liquidity because the nature of their businesses allows them to be less liquid than other styles of investors, to take advantage of these additional premiums, what we call the liquidity premium or the complexity premium, so additional returns available to them, but also improve their ability to recover in the event that a company should run into trouble and have additional diversification. And as we all know, diversification is the friend of the portfolio manager. So are private markets really then a safer investment in this environment? I mean, it's interesting to see that shift to private assets. But by the way, that shift had been ongoing for many years, gaining momentum over many years. But we're saying is you saw increased momentum in this recent period. We have seen it, and we've seen it a couple of different ways. I would say the first way we've seen it is this growth of the investment-grade alternatives, so allocating more to higher quality private assets. We've seen this in the form of investment-grade corporates and infrastructure, which is a market that insurers have invested in for an extremely long time. They continue to increase their allocations to this market, but also the growth of private asset-backed style markets, or what we call asset-based lending, which is a market being driven in part by banks, and particularly regional banks shrinking, and the insurance industry now providing the lending in some of these markets that the banks used to be able to provide. And that gives access to the insurers, to high quality assets that are substitutes for investment-grade assets that you would normally get in the public markets. So in that way, you're able to put additional quality, you're able to have additional diversification, and all of this that spreads, which are generally higher than in publics. And that's one way to build resilience in your portfolio. The second is when you have private credit and other types of private corporates, you typically have covenants inside those lending facilities, and covenants allow you to work with companies before they run into an issue. So these covenants provide investors a certain degree of protection, allows them a certain degree of control to be able to work with companies as they experience issues, which helps mitigate defaults and helps improve recoveries. Talk to us a little bit about the context of this, though, when we think about that shift towards private. Give us some numbers. I mean, if it was X percent of a general insurer portfolio, how much is it now? What's the delta? Sure. And let's look at life insurers in particular and why life insurers, because life insurers write savings products, give opportunities for people to buy things like annuities in which they save for a period of time, five years or 10 years, and then they get a return on that. And we're seeing annuity providers increase their private allocations from 35 to 37 percent up into the 45 percent range. So you're seeing reasonably sizable changes in the portfolio allocations into private assets, which still allows them quite a bit of liquid assets in case they would need it, but allows them to earn the incremental returns available in private assets. Well, that is pretty striking, though, that almost half of the assets now are on the private side, which is a big shift from what we saw 10, 15, 20 years ago. It's a shift. It's a 10 or 15 point shift, which is sizable. But one thing that's notable or that we should note is that insurers have always owned private assets. I started my career over 20 years ago buying private credit for an insurance company. So this is something that these companies have long done, and they've done it not just in the form of investment grade corporate privates, which is where I started, but they also have a commercial mortgage loan origination engines where they were buying commercial mortgage loans for their portfolios. And what we're seeing is that insurance companies are increasing the diversification, so the types of things they are buying. So it's not just commercial mortgage loans, but residential mortgage loans. It's not just corporate privates. It's now infrastructure privates. It's now asset-based lending. So the opportunities to lend private are growing, and that's also driving the increased opportunity to allocate. Yeah, Allison, the shift that's taking place, which has been gradual but quite consistent, also mirrors, as Matt said, the growth in the private markets themselves. You know, if we go back to 1997, there was a small company, Amazon, that did a IPO for $50 million, giving it a market capitalization of $450 million. Now you have companies, private companies, that have capitalizations that are in the billions, the tens of billions, the hundreds of billions. And how do they finance themselves? They come into the private markets. So the private markets themselves have been growing. They've been growing also in a percentage terms relative to the total market. And then the other major point that Matt made was diversification. And a lot of the credits in the public markets now, particularly that the insurers like, are more risky than they used to be. A typical insurance company, particularly a life company with long-dated liabilities and assets, might look at utilities. Utilities aren't as secure as they used to be. Telecommunications, energy companies, all of these industries are just more volatile. And when you're thinking about investing out 10 to 30 years, it's just riskier. And so how do I overcome some of that risk? Diversification. And you see more names, more obligors in the private markets now. Interesting. And of course, the long duration of the assets that insurers want to hold fits nicely with the private market opportunities. You mentioned utilities. They've been in focus in part because of all the developments we've been seeing in AI. And I feel like AI has gotten just modestly out of focus over the last few weeks as tariffs have been front and center. Yet, of course, it remains a tremendous theme. And it's an area that could be changing in some ways, the insurance landscape. What are you observing on the ground in terms of how insurers are using AI in their daily business? Well, Alison, in our survey, we asked questions about, are you using AI? Are you intending to use AI? Are you looking to invest in AI? And we were quite frankly surprised at the strength of the reads on both those fronts. So first, if you think about the typical insurance company, it is a very large operating organization with a tremendous amount of data, claims data, historical information. So first, large databases naturally lends itself to the use of AI. So can I use it in underwriting to better price policies that I'm offering? The answer is yes. Secondly, there's a lot of operations that take place in the insurance company. Claims come in, claims payments go out, premiums come in. So it's a large operating organization. Again, AI can bring efficiency to that entire operational process. But the other part is, rather than using, or instead of using AI to improve my operations, to make me more efficient, to make me a better underwriter, should I be investing? And a lot of AI looks very similar to infrastructure, long-dated, again, utilities that need to provide power, data centers that need to provide the information, software. So companies are also investing in AI in the investment portfolio for the returns. And I was surprised by that. I was surprised by the strength of that response. So we'd asked about investing in AI, and we asked about investing in four key areas. We asked about investing in hardware, software, data centers, and infrastructure as a thing, and then in utilities. And the strength of the responses was quite concentrated in data centers and infrastructure, and in utilities. And this was even after the announcement of DeepSeek, which came in early January. So even after the DeepSeek announcement, very strong interest in generating investment returns from data centers, infrastructure, and utilities. And it was pretty much a global response. I wonder if that's because they feel like that is a bit more of a defensive strategy in terms of investing in AI, because those sectors have traditionally been defensive. Do you have a theory on why that is? I think it's because the investment in AI is largely being driven by a very high-quality group of companies. The hyperscalers who are really making these significant investments in the infrastructure themselves. So if you're investing in the data center, or you're investing in the power to the data center, having the opportunity to lend to or invest alongside these super high-quality companies is something that people find quite attractive. When you look back in the early 2000s, when you look at all of the fiber that was laid as part of the rollout of the internet, and people sometimes compare, why is this different than then? How is this different structurally? It's who's financing it. And when you look at how the internet rollout and the fiber rollout was financed, it was financed largely in high-yield market, in smaller companies and startups, where the data center and infrastructure projects that are being financed are being financed by some of the most creditworthy companies in the world. Interesting. So Mike, if we think about all these changes that we observed over the last year and that became apparent in the survey, how will they ultimately affect the actual owners of insurance policies? So anything that improves the investment returns for the insurer, anything that lowers their costs ultimately will translate back into the cost of the policies that policyholders were bare. So let's split that into two parts. One is the life products, and as Matt said, these are typically savings or accumulation products. Well, if I can offer out a higher return, that's to the benefit of the consumer. And how do I get that higher return? Again, either I invest for better returns in the investment portfolio and or I reduce my operating expenses. On the property casualty side, the investment returns are important but not as critical. It's the underwriting returns that are important. And again, if I can become more efficient in my operations and be a better underwriter, I could charge less for my policies. And when you take a look at the industry globally, but also here in the United States, thousands of companies, it's a very, very competitive industry. So anybody that gets an advantage is going to try to push that advantage through their policy pricing, and that's going to force others to follow. Our clients are telling us that the end sales of their products, so the sales of annuities to consumers, are very strong. And we went through a period post-global financial crisis really through the COVID time where interest rates were very low. And as a result, fixed return products like annuities and sales of those types of savings instruments were very low because the returns weren't that attractive. Now that interest rates are higher, that investors and consumers are looking for places to protect their capital, generate return, build long-term retirement savings and retirement income, the sale of these products is very strong. So our clients are looking for investment styles in order to be able to meet this client demand. They're looking for the ability to continue to grow, and they need additional capital to be able to write new products to meet this demand. So there really is a lot of activity, which really feeds into the consumer health and the consumer well-being, particularly in retirement. Right. So the insurance business is booming, is what I'm hearing. The insurance business is healthy, and it's healthy across the life sector. The property and casualty sector, after a few years of inflation in their liabilities, is returning to health, and we're seeing quite a bit of activity in the property and casualty. So I would say the industry is looking reasonably healthy. Matt, Mike, thanks so much for joining us again. Thank you for having us. Thanks for your time.

So will tariffs send the U.S. into a recession? And if so, what might that recession look like? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top of my report from Goldman Sachs Research. I recently spoke with Paul Krugman, Jan Hatzius, and Oren Kass about what the radical shift in tariff policy could mean for the U.S. economy. I started off by asking Paul Krugman, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on international trade and economic geography, to give us some context on just how significant the Trump tariffs are. There has been nothing like this. The story keeps changing, but it looks like we're looking at an average tariff rate that is a little bit higher than the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. But Smoot-Hawley was starting off a base of quite high tariff rates. So the actual increase in Smoot-Hawley was a few percentage points on the average tariff rate. Here we're leaping from something like 3% average tariff to something like 20% or more average tariff, which is vastly bigger than Smoot-Hawley. And trade is about three times as big a share of the U.S. economy as it was in 1930. So this is, quite literally, people have asked me when I say this whether it's a figure of speech, but this is an order of magnitude bigger shock than anything that has ever happened in U.S. history, as far as I can tell anybody's history. Even when you look at developing countries that had very high tariffs for around 30 years after World War II, but they didn't get their all-in-one jump. So this is the biggest trade shock in history, as far as I can tell. So obviously this tremendous trade shock has raised concern about recession in the U.S., maybe even beyond, but certainly in the U.S. Where do you stand on that? Is recession most likely ahead? Is it even inevitable at this point, given the uncertainty? Well, okay. My track record at predicting recessions is terrible, but no worse than anybody else's. I mean, there have been studies. The success rate of economists at predicting recessions is approximately zero. That said, this does look like a recession, but what's funny about it is that if you asked me, do tariffs normally cause recessions, the answer would be no. Tariff means that people buy less of imported goods, but they might buy more of domestic goods, and it's not clear why that should lead to a recession. It has unpleasant consequences, it raises the cost of living, it reduces efficiency, but a recession is normally a collapse in demand, collapse in spending. So you wouldn't expect tariffs in general to do that. This secret sauce of the Trump tariffs is that they are extremely uncertain. Nobody knows what they will be. Nobody knows what comes next. Now if you're a business trying to make plans, would you want to invest under those conditions? Suppose that you're considering you have a component plant in Mexico and an assembly plant in the United States or whatever, should you invest in Mexico? Well, not if there's going to be high tariffs. Should you invest in the United States? Well, what if the tariffs go away? Then that'll be uncompetitive. So anything you do runs the risk of having a lot of money stranded, and there's a tremendous option value to just sitting on your hands and sitting on your cash. So this is unique. A stable tariff rate would not cause a recession, but an unpredictable tariff rate that can change next day is really a depressing effect on demand. And that's clear for business investment, but it also affects consumers, it affects home builders. So the uncertainty is the reason why a recession seems likely. People assume, well, because it's so self-inflicted, the antidote is very obvious. You know, we just reverse policy. If we saw a quick reversal of policy, is that the answer here? And then growth can rebound. No, in some ways, I almost think that the policy reversals, to the extent they happen, may in some ways, they make it worse because the reversal may be reversed a day or a week or a month later. So it doesn't make investing any easier because you still have no idea what the world will look like by the time your investment matures. At this point, can you conceive of anything that would convince markets and consumers that the uncertainty is behind us? Is there anything that would restore confidence from that perspective? It's hard because the thing about trade policy in particular is that the way it's set up in the United States, the law gives the president enormous discretion. No legislation has to be passed, no commitments need to be made, which means that he can change his mind overnight. And we set up that system to create some flexibility, basically pressure release valves around tariffs that were negotiated with other countries. We needed something that would let the United States respond if the political pressures became too great, but it was never intended to be used to make massive changes in trade policy. But that's what's happening now. And so even if they said, no, this is going to be our tariff policy and it will remain unchanged for the next three years, a week later, they can say, actually, we've decided to change it. And who can guard against that? So if we are talking about a likely recessionary scenario, will it be mild? Will it be deep? What is your best guess in terms of what this recession will actually look like? It doesn't look all that severe given what we now know, although again, this is completely uncharted territory. This is one of those situations where even historically comparisons, those are often your best route, but there is no comparison. So there's nothing like this has ever happened. That said, the sort of focal point of the recession threat is probably business investment. And I guess I'd say it's mostly business investment in tradable goods, in sectors that are either competing with imports or exports, where things are more strongly affected by the tariff regime. It's not clear to me why investments in health care, say, should be particularly affected by this. And our economy is probably about 75% non-tradable. So it's a limited set of stuff. But within that sector, it could be quite severe. Now, business investment is a significant share of GDP, but not nearly as big as consumer spending. So you would think that this is a shock that produces if it happens, a moderate recession. Although I think some of the wildcards here are, what about consumer spending? For consumers, there are fewer long-term decisions that are going to be whipsawed by all of this. But the effect on consumer perceptions, morale, is severe. And we have seen the biggest decline in consumer confidence ever, which is really quite remarkable because so far, the economy isn't suffering all that much. So we don't have soaring unemployment yet. We don't have soaring inflation yet, although the inflation is coming. But obviously, if you take the surveys at all seriously, people are extremely rattled. So if consumer spending falls off a cliff, yeah, then it can become a severe recession. So it is possible to tell stories where it's really very severe. So Krugman thinks it's not the size of the policy shift that's likely to cause a recession, but the uncertainty around it. And he thinks that any policy reversals may actually hurt rather than help, given that the reversals themselves may be reversed at a moment's notice. Next I spoke with Jan Hatzius, the head of global investment research here at Goldman Sachs and our chief economist. Hatzius also expects a large tariff-induced hit to U.S. growth. And while he's not currently calling for a recession, he says that would probably change if the full slate of Trump's Liberation Day tariffs were to take effect. As it stands today and as was reflected in our forecast for where the average tariff rate is going to go, we're expecting about a 16 percentage point increase in the average tariff rate. And in our view, that would be sufficiently bad to keep growth very weak this year. We have a baseline forecast of 0.5 percent, fourth quarter to fourth quarter. We have a recession probability of 45 percent, so very close to 50-50. So it's very, very significant, but doesn't quite shift the line for us to say recession is the base case. Stepping back, if you take the roughly 2 percentage point hit that we're estimating from the tariff increase to GDP growth, which takes you from what we thought was a little bit more than 2 percent growth for the year as a whole as we entered the year down to this 0.5 percent number, there are three components to the hit. One is the tax-like effect of increases in tariffs on real income and therefore consumer spending. Number two is financial conditions tightening. We saw a very rapid tightening in financial conditions following April 2nd. That's pulled back to some degree, but financial conditions still tighter than they were prior to the announcement. And then the third component, which overlaps a little bit with the financial conditions impact is greater uncertainty among businesses who are less willing to invest in capital equipment basically because of the uncertainty, because it makes sense to wait before you spend on long-lived capital equipment. What would lead you to move to a mainline recession call at this point? We were at 45 percent, and then the full reciprocal tariffs with the country-specific add-ons actually went into effect recently. We moved to a baseline recession call. And then when the pause was announced, we immediately moved back to 45 percent. So there are a number of paths. One is simply, actually, all of this does take effect. There is now a period of negotiations if they fail. And then for many or most or all of these countries, you do actually get back to these numbers that showed up on the big placard on April 2nd. I think that would be a reason to go back to a recession call, depending on what else we see. We're in a bit more of a data-watching mode here. We have an estimate of what all of this is going to do to the real economy, but of course, we're far from sure. And again, the uncertainty effect in particular is difficult to gauge. So over the next couple of months, we'll gain a lot of clarity in terms of what the damage to the economy really is. It's going to be a little bit difficult in the short term because there are a lot of data lags and distortions that are going to make it difficult to assess. So we might be flying blind for a while, but two months down the road, we'll have a much better picture. Like Krugman, Jan believes a recession would more likely be moderate than severe. But Jan says this is because a potential policy reversal could stabilize conditions in the near term. Here's Jan and I talking about this. So if we do end up in such a policy-induced recession, what would it most likely look like in terms of duration, severity? That's hard to know because obviously it's policy-induced, which means that what policy does and what trade policy does in particular is going to be really paramount. And you could argue it shouldn't be that severe because, well, once you do go into a recession, that's going to bring about a reaction. I tend to think that because, I mean, after all, we did see it move to a pause. So if you want to extrapolate from that, you would say, if you do go into a recession, if you actually see the recessionary data, they're going to pull back from that. But there's a lot of, obviously, unpredictability just in terms of how these decisions are made. And so that also makes it harder to assess how policy is going to respond to bad news on the economy. So what does all that tell me? I would say more likely it's going to be a less steep recession because it can be, in some sense, probably turned off or at least reversed, but can't be too sure about it. Well, interestingly, Paul Krugman, his take was that you just don't know if a decision to pull back is ultimately going to be temporary and that you could reverse the reversal. So he had a lot of concern about the uncertainty diminishing the ability of just the pullback in policy to be enough to avoid more sustainable damage and avert recessionary conditions, if we get to that point. I don't disagree that there's going to be potentially ongoing damage from this. But if there is a pullback, I do think it's still going to have a near-term positive effect. I think maybe to some degree, that effect diminishes the more times you go through one of these cycles, the smaller the effect. But my guess would be that, let's say, over the next few months, we get some really bad news on how the economy is performing, there will be a pullback. I think that pullback will stabilize conditions to some degree. Maybe you don't get a big bounce back. But I do think that because it's a policy-induced recession, if that's what it is, there is the ability to also at least stabilize things and keep you from continuing to contract at a rapid rate. I think that is different from, say, an OA type of situation where there's a reckoning in the financial markets and in the banking system and in the housing market. And the ability of policymakers to push against it is complicated because monetary policy is the main game in town. The funds rate is already at zero. It's just a limited amount that policymakers really can do. The big news is that the funds rate is 4.25%, so we're not close to a liquidity trap or an effective low of bond situation. So the Fed should cut a lot in order to support the economy and stabilize financial markets as well. The bad news is that these types of, I'll call it, stagflationary shock that push inflation up and growth down are just harder to deal with for policymakers because it's just hard to know whether you should mainly focus on the inflation or mainly focus on the weakness and growth. I think if the hits were large enough, even if you then have an even bigger short-term increase in inflation, but if you saw a serious deterioration in the labor market, I have no doubt that the Fed would cut and probably actually cut quite aggressively because I think they would take the view, one, of course, maximum employment is part of their mandate. And two, if the labor market is really weakening, then that is going to suppress second-round effects on inflation. And therefore, you can treat the tariff-driven price increase as more of a price level shift rather than the start of a serious fall of inflation. So ultimately, I think the Fed's probably going to be a little bit late because of the difficulty of deciding between the inflationary impact and the real economic impact. But if things were to really seriously deteriorate, they would do a lot, and I think they would have quite a large impact. Finally, I spoke with Oren Cass. Oren is the founder and chief economist of American Compass. He argues that while Trump's trade policies will entail some short-term costs, there's no reason these policies would need to cause a recession. On the contrary, he says they should lead to a great deal of investment and better economic outcomes for America. I think the Trump administration has been very on point in focusing on what has gone wrong over the past generation with globalization, the realities of China's rise and the shift to a multipolar world and what that's going to mean for the U.S., both in terms of economic and security relationships, and therefore, a recognition that things do need to change and there are costs associated with a change. But accepting some short-term costs in pursuit of a better long-term arrangement is a much better choice than simply sitting back and waiting to have things happen to us. So I think that's been very encouraging, and frankly, the fact that we have an administration that is willing to consider the long-term and accept short-term costs in its pursuit is a very good thing. I think most of the serious economists who are looking at this situation are recognizing that there are some ways in which these costs raise the possible risk of recession, but they certainly don't guarantee one. Markets certainly aren't signaling that this is some sort of catastrophic and unsustainable cost. And I think the reality is that the actual substance of the moves, if you think about how much of the economy actually depends on imports from these various places, what the implications of the tariffs actually are, what substitutes are available, the actual policies themselves are not sufficient to affect a substantial market correction or send growth negative on their own. The question is much more, what are the second-order effects likely to be? So for instance, what is the effect on consumer confidence, business confidence, and so forth? And that is obviously much less of a science. And so how the administration communicates things, what other developments occur, how markets do and don't react, how the media treats the entire story, all of that is going to have an effect too. But there's certainly no reason that the kinds of policies that they are pursuing would need to cause a recession. To the contrary, they should produce a great deal of investment. I think that being said, there are a lot of very fair concerns with some of the specifics of how they have gone about it out of the gate in terms of both the abruptness of a lot of changes and then in terms of the lack of communication about what the actual long-term goal is. And so I think it's very understandable that allies are frustrated in a lot of cases. It's understandable that markets are frustrated in a lot of cases. And I think you're seeing the administration start to try and correct course. Am I hearing you correctly that if the administration gives more certainty, as you think they have begun to do, do you think that's going to lead to a better near-term economic outcome? Or are you saying we might still have near-term economic weakness as this rewiring takes place? There will be short-term costs regardless. I think some of those short-term costs are associated with the rewiring. I mean, one thing I remind folks is that typically when you're talking about here are some short-term costs we need to incur to achieve some long-term benefit. We refer to those short-term costs as investment. And in some respects, it's literally investment. We're talking about needing to divert more resources to the development of productive capacity. And so certainly in the short term, that is a cost, but it can be a very worthwhile one. I think there is also a cost potentially from the market perspective in terms of reduced profit expectations. Obviously, globalization and easy access to cheap labor was very good for multinational corporations' profits. And if we are reversing course on that, it might be perfectly natural to say that equity values and expectations of forward profits are going to be somewhat lower. So from some perspectives, that may be a cost, but that's also a great example of a place where the stock market does not provide a useful proxy for the actual well-being of the country or the strength of the economy. Some people have actually argued, though, that the ability of companies to generate strong profits is an important pillar of the U.S. economy's strength. So what would you say to that? Well, going all the way back to the wealth of nations, Adam Smith said the rate of profit is always highest in those countries going fastest to ruin. The broader question of whether the United States is a good place to do business, I think, is a very important one. And the reality is that in a lot of ways, what has happened with both globalization and financialization over the past few decades is that we have made America a much better place to earn a lot of money, but in ways that don't necessarily generate any of the positive benefits for the country that are the reason we want businesses to be here and succeeding. And so I think what the agenda ultimately comes down to is wanting to reestablish that linkage between successful, profitable businesses and activities that actually are good for the people who actually live here in this country. The place where I have less sympathy about the uncertainty narrative is that while there are a lot of variables floating out there in the ether, the reality is that almost regardless of how those are resolved, the required strategy or the dominant strategy in response would be to be investing significantly more in US-based production. None of the outcomes on the table are ones where you would wish you'd focused more on offshoring or hadn't been focused on figuring out how you could do more domestically. And so to some extent, I think there's a Doth protest too much dynamic to a lot of the largest corporations that are still looking for excuses not to do that. What do you say to people though who say, well, but what if the tariffs are negotiated lower through a trade deal or four years from now, we have a different administration who goes back to the prior tariff regime? What then? I think there will probably still be plenty of policy changes in various directions. And so the challenge for business leaders is always what is the best and most plausible course and what is the one that is likely to work out all things considered. Nobody hesitated to rush all of their investment to China as soon as it was granted WTO membership, notwithstanding the obviously massive risks associated with sending all of your investment into the state controlled market. And of course, in some respects that worked out very well in the short run. And in a lot of respects, a lot of corporations have absolutely had their lunch eaten in the medium to long run, but they all seemed really fine and comfortable doing that. And so this idea that we just can't operate in this world of less than perfect certainty about the geopolitical conditions for the next 30 years is, I think, a little bit lame. Let's leave it there.

I'm Alison Mass, Chairman of Investment Banking in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking and Markets, and your host for this episode. Today I have the pleasure of sitting down with Jeffrey Perlman, the CEO of Warburg Pincus. Warburg Pincus is one of the pioneers of private equity investing, having raised its first fund in 1971. Today it has about $90 billion in assets under management, offices around the world, and a relatively new CEO. I'm excited to hear how Jeff plans to build on his firm's legacy amid all of the opportunities and challenges faced by private equity firms today. So Jeff, welcome to the program. Thanks for having me. Before I get to your career, I want to start with your firm. Take us back to 1971 when Warburg Pincus launched its first P.E. fund, and tell us a little bit about what the investing world looked like then, and what was the opportunity that your firm's leaders saw then? Yeah, this may not surprise you, Alison, but that does predate me. But going back to that first fund, Lionel Pincus was really a visionary for the industry, really coined the term private equity. And when I look back in 1971, we raised, at the time, it was a $41.5 million fund. I think the Wall Street Journal at the time said, wow, where is Warburg Pincus going to be able to invest all of this capital? That much money. And if you went back also, what was unique was we called all the capital on day one. Obviously, today we all are used to capital calls, the capital being invested over multiple years. But candidly, no one trusted their investors in those days. It was a new product in that regard. So we called all the capital on day one. Also, the limited partnership agreement, I think it was all of 10 pages. And it probably covers about 95% of what's in our documents today that now consists of about 1,000 pages. So the visionary elements that Lionel had, when you think about the structure of that vehicle, pretty much still holds today. I think also when we go back to the 1970s, it was a very uneven decade in terms of performance for the markets. The markets were basically flat over almost the entirety of that decade. But like anything, you still find opportunities. So I was going back in time, and one of the great investments in that fund was we invested all of $5 million for a 10% stake in 20th Century Fox. Right before Star Wars ultimately came out. And so it was a great kind of example of a lot of noise, a lot of challenging times, really interesting and compelling opportunities to invest in. Yeah. 1974 was one of those years that I think when we were in business school, we studied what happened in the market. So you talk about the investment environment in 1971, but how does that compare with the current environment? There is a perception that higher rates and an uncertain geopolitical environment, and that's an understatement, not to mention a greater degree of competition, make this a really difficult environment for private equity investors. So what is your view of today's environment? Yeah, first, I'd say there's a tendency for investors to get caught up in the current moment as this is the most complicated that we've ever seen. If you think about, again, the 1970s, or you think about when we're going through the fall of the Soviet Union, you weren't sure what it was going to look like on the other end. But ultimately, obviously, things continued to work out and that compounding in terms of positive growth continued. And look, I think we're living through a number of factors here. Chip Kaye, who's our chairman, who I succeeded in this role, Chip says he's been at the firm roughly 40 years. The first 25, he saw declining rates. The last 15, he saw ultra low rates. And it's really the first time in 40 years that you're really seeing a structural step up in rates. And so I think that's first and foremost, the industry has to contend with that. The industry has to contend on top of that with really the most amount of inventory it's had at one point in time, right? We've got an average hold period now in private equity of over six years, 60% of the inventory has been around for over four years. So we've got to continue to work off the excess, especially of the 2021 vintage that existed. And then you've got potentially a little bit of a change, or maybe a material change in what this economic order, you know, the U.S. architected going back the last seven or eight decades. So there's no question, this is a challenging macro and geopolitical environment. And I think for an investor like us, one of our defining features is our diversification. I think everyone likes to feel like they can predict the future. I think few have been able to demonstrate that they can do that consistently. And at the end of the day, it comes back to, are you diversified? And I think the firm is really well positioned in that regard to try to navigate through as we have for over 50 continuous years of investing. You're talking about diversification on your asset classes or geographically both? I think when we think about diversification by design, we think about it by vintage. This is a very pro cyclical industry. Everyone likes to invest a lot at the peak, and then they tend to under invest during periods of stress. And then they wonder why do we end up below the benchmark? So I think a vintage diversification is so important. Try to invest about the same amount year in and year out. Second is certainly geographic, third sector diversification. And then the fourth, which is also overlooked, is also in terms of number of deals, right? Being sometimes too concentrated can really exacerbate. One time you're in the top quartile, maybe you're in the bottom quartile. And one of the areas where the industry has really changed dramatically is really the persistence point. Because if you go back in time, even 20 years ago to roughly around 2006, the percentage probability of a private equity fund who is in the first quartile to then be in the first quartile again in the next fund was over 40%. Today it's less than a quarter. So there's been a big change. And I think those investors who can deliver that consistency and persistence of returns, I think are going to be even more valuable to their investors and to their LPs going forward. And I think because of this outperformance that we've seen in the public markets over the last handful of years, public markets have outperformed in the US, their hundred year average by 50% up until obviously recently. And I think for our LPs, especially the big institutions, when they look out over the next decade, I think the value of private equity to them, the ability to generate that outperformance is going to be even more important in this next decade than it was in the previous decade of what was pretty strong public market performance. So I want to pivot to talk about you. How did you find your way to Warburg Pincus? You know, it was a good question. At first, I didn't, when I was first going into investment banking, I didn't even know what that was at first, when I was in the business school, in the undergraduate business school at the University of Michigan. And my sister, who's three years older, had also gone to the Michigan business school because my father gave us great advice growing up. Both my parents were lawyers, but my father told us, above all else, don't be a lawyer. And he said, there's only 24 hours in a day. You can't bill your clients more than that. And he said, go into business. I've seen how well many of these companies that he'd advised and he could charge by the hour. They were benefiting from kind of that advice in the form of profits. And so he steered us that way. And so my sister was the first to take that advice. She went to the undergraduate business school at the University of Michigan. Then she went into investment banking, and I just kind of wrote our coattails first to that. And lo and behold, we both ended up at the formerly kind of now defunct Credit Suisse or Credit Suisse First Boston at the time. And it just so happened when I was an analyst, I was working for, even though I was in the real estate investment banking group, I was working for an individual in the financial sponsors group, really working for a number of sponsors. And it just so happened he was having a dinner with someone who had just joined Warburg Pincus, who was a good friend of his. And they were talking about dinner, and the person who had just joined Warburg had mentioned that he really needed a good junior resource, and did he know anyone, not thinking that he would know someone for real estate. And the individual who's at CS in the sponsors group, and I'll leave unnamed, said, well, there's this one guy who does most of my work and lets me leave early all the time. So you should really kind of go have a conversation with him. And one thing led to another, and then ended up at Warburg, thinking that maybe I was going to go another year later. But they just raised or were just raising a global real estate fund. And it was their first foray into that space. And so it gave me an opportunity to come over right away. And what year is that? That was in 2006. So almost 20 years ago. So then what led you to Asia? So Asia was a little bit by happenstance. There's some people who grow up, and they're looking for that adventure, and they want to scratch that itch by kind of going to a place like Asia. I wasn't that person. I was probably more prototypical American in the Midwest. Probably my geography wasn't my strength. But right around the financial crisis, there was an opportunity that the firm was looking at in China. And again, it had a real estate element to it. Chip, who had built our Asia business, tapped me on the shoulder and said, hey, do you mind going out for a couple weeks to go help with the team, help with the transaction over there? So of course, I jumped at the opportunity to try to be helpful, went out to China. And in that period of time, just in those few weeks while I worked on that deal, I also happened to come across another opportunity. And really over a period of 12 or 18 months, the trips to China kept getting longer. To me, it was just fascinating, the opportunity set. And as the trips got longer, as the opportunity set seemed to grow, as the U.S. was navigating through the financial crisis at that point, I was smart enough to first propose to my wife. And then about a month later, I said to her, we'd probably see each other a lot more if we were in the same place. And so then propositioned, maybe we should go to Hong Kong. And Chip had been someone who was whispering in my ear that it was the best kind of six years of his career, the opportunity to go build a real business and a franchise over there. And I just saw how much opportunity there was. And fortunately, my wife said yes on both fronts. And then we went to move to Asia, more formally, kind of end of 09. That's great. So you talked about Chip setting up the business, the previous CEO in Asia, and then you went in and significantly expanded the business, including the real estate business there. So were there any strategies that you found particularly successful in Asia to do that? One of the reasons why I liked real estate so much in an Asia context was I felt it was one of the best ways to play emerging consumption at scale. Many of the other areas, whether you were at the time in China, 15, 20 years ago, looking at a health care deal, it would be like a $30 million investment, whereas because you're investing in hard assets, you had a huge opportunity. I also liked real estate because when you looked at the listed universe of real estate companies, in the US, you would look in home buildings like 5% or 6% of the total pie at office and retail and logistics and self-storage. And you looked in Asia. And at that time, it was 98% comprised of home builders, of residential developers. And I looked at that. I said, there has to be an opportunity to go build leading players in each of these other areas. And so kind of marrying the private equity mindset of the firm with an understanding of the bricks and mortar of the real estate. And so we very much went on to do that. We built the largest logistics real estate company, but one of the largest data center businesses, self-storage companies, so on and so forth over a long period of time. So I thought that was one that was very powerful. I also saw, and to Chip's credit, we were very early to go into China and India, right? We just celebrate our 30th anniversary in China, and next year will be our 30th in India. And I really saw an opportunity to really, if you've been to the movie before, how can you leverage that in other markets? And we looked at Southeast Asia, and you had obviously both the population, you had disposable incomes, kind of hitting that inflection point of the ability to consume. And now, it was almost 15 years ago, we really started that franchise by setting up the office in Singapore, but actively investing in areas like in places like Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, et cetera. So I think those were two that really stood out. And I'd say really the third over time was really trying to build out a more diversified Asia business, because in my view, investors have woken up to the reality of China can be up, India can be down. India's up, China's down. Most are trying to look at it and say, look, Asia's going to represent two-thirds of global growth over the next decade. We want to try to find a diversified way to play that. And so really what we needed to do was take the success that we had more in emerging Asia and really start to build that out across mature Asia. So you mentioned that you celebrated 30 years in China last year and are going to mark 30 years in India next year, talking about GDP growth. So talk about how those markets have evolved over the years from your perspective. One of the unique angles, I guess, or lens that we've had, because we've been there for so long, is really the difference in, I'd say, the capital environment in both markets and how it's really then translated into what I would call the operational talent that exists in the markets. What I mean by that is, if you take India, India has been in an environment where capital was always very expensive and it was less readily available. And it really forced a bunch of entrepreneurs to really be very strong operators with their businesses. And we've seen that time and time again with the companies that we've invested in. Whereas in China, over the past 30 years, up until really more recently, capital was readily available and in a way, probably more subsidized. From the local banks. Yeah, at a lower cost. And so with that, you still have just such talented entrepreneurs in China, great vision and ability to kind of grow, but there was less operational focus and talent around how do you manage the cost side of the equation and profitability. And so I think the challenge that I've posed to our teams there as we look going forward is really in China, I think the real test is going to be now the real private equity model. It's less momentum investing going forward. It's really going to be what we do here in the US and Europe and elsewhere. What can we do to grow earnings of this business and the value creation associated with that? And I think for me, the litmus test for the team in China is really threefold. One is we're investing in things that have to go with government policy, especially longer term government policy. The second is, I believe for exit, we need to be able to make sure we're underwriting a sale to a domestic party. It's hard to say when the foreigners are going to show back up again and do it. I think over time they will, but it's going to take some time. And then the third is, I think you have to have control or significant influence in governance specifically for the reason I mentioned, we've got to have our hand on the steering wheel to affect the value creation plan and really help the operational side of the businesses that in India, I feel like, again, you have such strong operators because they've always had to deal with a very high cost of capital in the market. And you think now there's more of an opportunity to have that majority ownership than there was. Yes, and I think that's across Asia as a whole. I mean, in the early days, there were very few because these are first generation entrepreneurs and a lot of instances, they were not looking to hand over control of their business. I think as we sit today, I look back over the last even four or five years, over 70, 75% of our investments have been in majority control deals in Asia. That tends to surprise a number of our own investors of that, but that's how the market has continued to transform. Check sizes have gotten bigger, and again, the ability to get control, to be a majority investor, I think has grown considerably, even over just the last five years alone. So you talked a little bit earlier about how Warburg Pincus has approached diversification. How has that approach affected your ability to return capital to shareholders, which so many LPs are now so focused on? I think it is the most important question. As an industry, while I think private equity is one of the few financial innovations that has always delivered on its stated promise over time, it's delivered this outperformance versus the public markets over a long period of time. But when you look at the liquidity element of it, the industry has now gone three consecutive years at distributions at 50% of its historical average, essentially 10% of NAV versus the historical 20% of NAV. And we've been very much the opposite of that, right? We've returned 50% more than we've invested over the last five years. That's extraordinary. You know, 45 billion distributed versus 30 invested, which Bloomberg reported over the last 12 months. One is diversification is incredibly powerful, because I can always find things to sell in the portfolio. Yeah. You have more flexibility. You have things that are uncorrelated that you can make sure you can find elements to sell. And then even in the first few months of 25, we've sold three very large businesses, which Goldman has helped on as well, that are in totally different sectors. We sold a business in financial services, Kestra, a healthcare IT business in modernizing medicine, and an industrials business, Sundyne. So it just speaks to, again, the benefits that come from a diversified portfolio, things in pockets that are uncorrelated. I think the second is the alignment model we have. One of the benefits of being one integrated global partnership, a true kind of old school partnership is we're all in the same bucket. And so it encourages everyone to want to sell to kind of get money off the table. And I'd say the third is you have to have a top down approach associated with pushing the importance of realizations. And one of the benefits that I've had and Chip had before me of spending the time in Asia is that the business cycles tend to be more compressed. And what that means is you can't fall in love with your assets. You always have to find opportunities to get money off the table when you can. So I think for us, it's combining the core principle of diversification with alignment and the economic model that we have within the firm. Those two, I think, are a very powerful combination. So in 2023, you came back to New York to serve as the firm's president. So what did you learn in Asia that helps you now as a global leader? I'd say a few things. One is what I just described, which is you can't fall in love with your assets. You have to have a rigorous discipline on returning capital because you don't know when that next window is going to be there. I'd say the second is the importance of culture across the entirety of a firm, right? You can have culture in pockets, but ultimately, especially if you're one firm, you want to make sure whether the team's in India or China or Southeast Asia, U.S., everyone's representing the firm through one voice and one aligned message. And I think being out there and seeing the differences that exist in these markets, different people, different culture, is making sure you can preserve that and enhance it as best you can. So I think that was another very big one. And I'd say the third is you're dealing in very complicated jurisdictions, right? These are, I've always said, like, if you can build a successful business or franchise in a market like Asia, which is not one market. It's many different countries. It's different languages, laws, regulations, then I think you can pretty much do it anywhere. And to me, having seen that over a long period of time, different crises come up and how each of them kind of respond, both with right policy or sometimes the wrong policy, and how you try to navigate that, I think it's been invaluable for me is when I look at the firm through an entire lens. So you've talked about your relationship with Chip, Chip K. Is there one lesson, I'm sure he's taught you many things, but is there one lesson that you've learned from him that stands out? Look, Chip's been a phenomenal mentor to me and really just a world-class individual. And I think he's really representative of, you know, if I could bottle up Warbur Pincus almost in one person, I think Chip exudes that more than anyone I can think of. It's really been the importance of culture. He wears it on his sleeve every day. I think most would say that I think Chip knows every single person's first name in the firm. We're at a firm now, we're approaching a thousand people. It's not so easy. Wow. I'm going to have to challenge him on that next time I see him. You should, you should. And probably he'd be the first to say that maybe that's why he was ready to hand over the reins, that it gets harder. He only knew 800 of the thousand. It gets harder and harder as it goes on. And look, this is one of the big challenges, I think, for this next phase of the firm's future is how do you preserve such a great culture? It's one of the defining characteristics of the place as you scale and as you grow. And I think that's where Chip has a lot of faith and trust in the next generation to go do that. But to me, his always kind of putting the firm first and preserving the culture of the place I think is, again, one of the great differentiators for the firm and one we're going to continue to lean into going forward. Yeah. And you mentioned that all of the incentives are aligned to be consistent with that as well. So that certainly helps. So you were named CEO last summer and formally took the role on in September. So what has been the biggest surprise so far in being a CEO? The transition was over a few years. So in a way, I was kind of commenting to someone the other day, the day you kind of become CEO is like when you have a birthday, someone asks you, do you feel you're older? And you're kind of like, eh, it kind of feels the same. So to Chip's credit, I think it was a really well-managed, well-staged leadership transition. It's been hugely energizing both internally and externally. Look, I'd say from my side, it's really just the prioritization. I think like any time when you're your own deal partner, when your own group head, when you're running a region, you have the deals that are in front of you. You have the pipeline that's kind of coming behind. When you have something like a Warburg Pincus as a whole, there's so many things that we can be thinking about both for the existing portfolio of 200 portfolio companies. As we think about new funding channels over the long term, there's so many things to be focused on. And at some point at the end of the day, you have to decide when's the time to just pour yourself a glass of wine and kind of call it a day because your mind is always thinking about the next five or 10 things you could be doing. And really the prioritization around that is to me the most important. So you've talked about the leadership transition a little bit, but I think in your industry, Warburg has been a textbook case on seamless leadership transition, starting with Lionel Pincus, as you mentioned early on. Are there any lessons that other firms can take from your example, meaning Warburg's example? Yeah. So I mean, next year will be our 60th anniversary for the firm, and this is only our second leadership transition in that period. So I'm now the third representative of the third generation of leadership in the place. So A, I think what Lionel first did by looking out and seeing that in an investing firm, he fundamentally believed that you need continuity. And so if you're going to keep changing out leadership every five years, it's going to be very challenging, both with your investors and with the folks who are showing up every day to try to determine what's the right strategy for us to look at going forward. So I'd say when he skipped a generation, it was quite unpopular at the time, but now you've seen many of our peers follow suit with that same kind of philosophy. And certainly I think Chip and the other senior folks within the firm believed in that as well. I think second has been really kind of architecting it early, signaling to the broader firm. This wasn't a situation where you see it in other places where you have a public competition of four people, one ultimately gets it, three don't, and then not surprisingly, the three feel that it's time to move on. We haven't lost anybody in this transition. It's empowering to the next generation. They each have kind of a big role to play, and I'm just one piece of that. And I think that mindset has been permeated throughout the place by Chip. And I think that's been a big piece of it. And I'd say, look, the third is putting the institution above oneself. And this is where I give Chip enormous credit because, look, during his stewardship of the firm, AUM grew by over tenfold. And you could easily say that him and that senior partnership should be able to go monetize the enterprise value that's certainly been kind of created. Chip was the first to say as a non-founder that if you really want to have a successful investing institution, one that's going to stand the test of time, that ownership needs to be transient. It needs to reside with the people who show up every day to source the deals, to manage the deals, and ultimately to exit and realize the deals. And so they never sat there and said, what can I do kind of for myself in the process? And also, Chip is someone, and you know him well, that could easily have continued on to go do this. But he put the institution first by saying there's this great next generation of talent. And I think his defining legacy will be the depth of talent that he's built across the firm and saying, you know what, I got to give them their opportunity to go see what they can take the firm to the next heights and root for their success. Because that's your legacy as opposed to so many other instances where at times maybe a founder feels that to show how indispensable they are, they want to show how indispensable they are. And it's not necessarily empowering the next generation of leadership. And so I think each of those factors, and I'd say the last one, which is so important in our industry is really being transparent in the communication with our investors. I mean, they're such important partners of ours. We are very open from the beginning. We walk through the stages of it, the plan around it. We consistently communicate it throughout the process. And look, stakeholders like over-communication. And I think that was also an important feature of it. So it's interesting because I recently interviewed David Gross, who became co-managing partner of Bain Capital last year. And in 2022, I interviewed Joe Bay, who became co-CEO of KKR along with Scott Nuttall in 2021. So I have two questions based on that. What is it like to be part of this new generation of leadership running these private equity firms? And coincidentally, or maybe not coincidentally, all three of you spent the bulk of your career in Asia, which to me is fascinating. So what is it about that trend and being out there that you think positioned you well for being the CEO of these great firms? Just to touch on the second part, because it's an interesting observation, and you're not the first to have kind of pointed out the fact that a number of us came from having spent time in Asia. And I think it goes back a little bit to what I'd said earlier, which is it's a very complicated part of the world. And if you can demonstrate an ability to build a franchise and to build a platform over there, you deal with so much complexity, again, because it's not one market. It's a collection of many different markets. I think that's one big element of it. I think, I know Chips always believe this, and I do as well. To really lead a global investing business, I think you need to have lived and invested outside of your home market, right? And I think it just opens up- It opens up your mind to, I think, either biases you may have or others that maybe you should adopt some of. So I think there is a real element to that. I think that's probably where the most, maybe, commonality comes from in that. I think the opportunity, I think, and I see this when I see Joe and others is, I think it's incredibly energizing. I've always thought I had a lot of energy. I've never been, I feel like, this energized. It's incredibly exciting. We have the ability to shape the future. As I said, because that older generation did not go ahead and try to monetize that, probably it would have been the expense of that, the subsequent generations thereafter. You could imagine how energizing it is, not just for me, but for the rest of the firm. So I think, A, there's so much to do with the firm, and as a business builder, I'm excited about that element. And then I think also, as someone who believes in the importance of giving back to the community as well, I think from that perch, I think your reach is that much greater. And so to me, that's the other really energizing element of this as well. Yeah. I will tell you, as someone who deals with a lot of your partners around the world, it is very energizing for them to have a new generation of leadership. And your style is much more like one of their partners, and we see it from the outside in. As you look across the world today, what do you think are the greatest opportunities for a firm like Warburg? You know, look, everyone's going to be caught up in, as I said, the tariffs of the moment, and it's always the one that's in front of you. And I think one of the great strengths you have to have is to kind of see above the trees. And I look out, and as I said, there's so many different subsets of opportunities that are independent of that. Obviously, you look out at Asia, huge opportunity, two-thirds of global growth is going to be there. Sure, tariffs are going to have a near-term impact on supply chains around the world and where some of the goods are kind of made, but ultimately, these are still rising populations that are becoming more affluent. Therefore, they'll be able to kind of consume more and more going forward. I think the second and the much more consequential one, I think even more so than tariffs, will be AI and the impact of what that can do in terms of the revenue side of our portfolio companies, the expense and cost optimization side of our businesses. Certainly, it can be as much a threat as it is an asset. But I think when we look at it, there's just huge opportunities that come from that. And I think with this next generation coming in place in the firm of someone that's always been very focused on how do we bring technology into the investing process in the firm. I see it even right now, we're using it for prospecting. So when our investment professionals, for example, go to Seattle to go see a company through our application, they can go immediately see who are dormant prospects, who are, if you're within three miles, five miles, 30 miles, who else can you set up meetings with that are in that sector, in that space. The potential is significant. It's going to obviously have a number of second and third derivative impacts, but we really have an ability to architect how we want it to both apply to the firm, but ultimately to the portfolio and to the investment decision process. And to me, that's another very exciting area and huge opportunity. Yeah, it is exciting. And you can learn AI and the implications from your children as well, who will know more than you quickly. Also very true. So in December, you and Mark Lipschultz, co-CEO of Blue Owl Capital, were honored at the Wall Street Dinner, a major fundraising event for the UJA Federation of New York for your contributions to the Jewish community. So tell me a little bit about those causes that are important to you. Yeah, it was something that was always incredibly important to my parents. They worked incredibly hard, but they always said they had their second job, which was what they were doing for the community. And so they really distilled that down to both my sister and me. And it's something that, as they always said, as you elevate in your roles, your opportunity to contribute grows that much more. And first and foremost, for me, the community element is so important. So I grew up in Detroit, the continued ability to support. I sit on the board of the Detroit Children's Fund, really helping the school system in greater Detroit and trying to continue to elevate that and really bring opportunities across the board in terms of education, not just to a limited subset of folks. But to me, children, education are so intertwined, so important in terms of kind of longer term success. So trying to do everything I can in the local communities, whether it's Detroit, whether it was New York, when we were in Asia, we were doing the same. Because I think each time you're living in a different place, the community is giving you something. And so the ability to give something back to it, I think, is so important. So that's been a big one. And then the Jewish community has always been a close and important issue to me. And obviously, especially post-October 7th, it became even more important to really step up for the community. And Mark and I had the privilege of being able to represent the community that evening. So it is something that we try to devote as much time as humanly possible. And as you know, there's only 24 hours in a day. Like your father told you. But exactly. But fortunately, he gave me the right advice initially, which really opened up the potential to contribute even more. So I'm grateful for that. So we'd like to end these sessions of the lightning round. So we're going to run through a couple of questions. Just get a quick one-word or two-word answer. So what was your very first investment? I think it was, at least professionally, it was investing in like B-minus rental apartments in Southeast U.S., trying to make them into B, B-plus apartments. Was it a successful investment? It was okay. It was okay. Okay. We'll go on. What do you think your greatest strength is as an investor? I think it's being even-killed. You can't get caught up too much in sometimes the hype, and at the same time, you can't get paralyzed by kind of the stress. You've got to, as I say, you've got to be able to see over the trees. And I think, and be measured in that approach, especially when you're sitting at the helm of a large investing institution. So I think that's a great strength of mine. So what's the best piece of advice you have ever received? I'm going to say it in a lighthearted way, and it was Lionel Pincus when I joined the firm. And Lionel once said, because it was a very difficult environment, he said, I've never met a rich pessimist. And you know what? We get so caught up in these uncertain and difficult and challenging environments. And when the start of COVID happened, when you went back to the GFC, when you went back to when the tech bubble burst, it's so easy to think that, you know, are we going to make it through to the other side? And so again, I think it's just a great reminder of don't get caught up in the moment. And yes, we are. Some of these are going to have much greater consequences than maybe anyone kind of imagined. But at the same time, you can't get paralyzed by that. And over time, the world's innovative. The best ideas usually tend to win. And longer term, the power of compounding is pretty impactful. And I think you're right. People like to work for optimistic people, not pessimists. All right. So where do you spend your time outside the office? What are your most important recreations? When I'm not traveling kind of all over the world, you know, I have two young kids still. So my daughter just turned seven. My son just turned four. So they keep me very preoccupied on the weekends when I'm around. I try to fit in a run on the weekends, especially just it's a great way to kind of clear the mind. And skiing does that, too, when you have the few opportunities to ever go out on the mountain. If you don't pay attention, you can fall. And so it's a great way to kind of clear your mind and worry about your next turn. Exactly. And it's rare because every part of every other day is you're thinking about five other things at that one moment in time. So I think that's an important piece. But with younger kids, the time is spent on them. Yep. I get it. So finally, in particular, in the geopolitical environment we're in at the moment, what do you most excited about in the world right now? Look, I think it's what's to come. It's less what's already happened. It's the ability to kind of shape the future. And this is where, again, I think you've had different technologies that have come at certain points in time, even in my lifetime, and when mobile was established. And then there's been other things like IoT or the Internet of Things, which maybe didn't play out exactly as maybe people had hoped for. And then I think with Gen AI and the potential around it, this will be transformational in a number of ways. And so trying to position ourselves to capture that, not to figure out what's going to be the winning language model. It's going to be how and what ways can we implement and apply this to our investing, to the companies that we invest in. To me, that's, to me, the most exciting part because that chapter is unwritten at this point. I agree. It is exciting. Thank you so much for joining me today. Thank you for having me.

So will the increasing uncertainty about the economic outlook reverse this trend or accelerate it? I'm Alison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by James Reynolds, Global Co-Head of Private Credit and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and by Lotfi Karoui, our Chief Credit Strategist and the Head of Credit, Mortgages and Structured Products Research. James Lotfi, welcome back to Exchanges. Thanks for having me. Thank you. Lotfi, lots of volatility in the markets right now, but today we're going to focus on private credit markets. So give us some context. How much has the asset class grown in the past few years and what's really driving that growth? Well, it's been in focus because it's a young and new asset class that has experienced dramatic growth over the last 15 years. And so I think the reason why it's attracted so much attention is that everyone is expecting to see how it behaves in a full-blown sort of recession or a cyclical downturn. But let me take a step back actually and kind of define what we mean by private credit. But if you define it as any sort of debt claim that is privately negotiated without any third party being involved, such as a bank, the total AUM, if I use a conservative estimate, is probably to the tune of 2.1 trillion. So that is smaller than private equity, which is over $11 trillion. But that is on par with comparable public debt markets like the high-yield bond market, for example, or the BSL or the broadly syndicated loan market. And so private credit, if you define it that way, has unquestionably grown into becoming a distinct and scalable asset class for most asset allocators globally. That figure in 2010 was less than $100 billion, just to put things in context. Like what type of strategies does that involve? Obviously corporate lending is a big part of it across various parts of the capital structure. So senior direct lending is a big component of it, but also mezzanine, distressed and special situations. And to that, I would also add real estate and infrastructure. So you put all of that together and you get that 2.1 trillion figure. Interesting. James, you've been at the forefront of this asset class's growth. Tell us a little bit about your role, what you do at Goldman Sachs related to this, and how private credit has changed over the past few years from your seat. So I oversee the private credit business within asset wealth management, together with my co-head, Vivek Bantwal. And by the way, I've been doing private credit for the last 25 years. But at Goldman, we've been investing in private credit since the mid-90s, pretty much. You asked about what has changed over the past few years, certainly we've seen a lot of growth in the past 25 years, but also really in the past five to 10 years. A lot of this growth is associated with the growing acceptance of private credit as a solution for the borrowers, for privately owned companies, and in particular for the ones that are owned by private equity firms. And the reason for that would be what private credit can bring to the table, which is certainty. And again, in the world of volatility, that certainty of funds is something that is very important for the owners of these businesses, but also flexibility, confidentiality, ability to move fast, creativity, flexible capital. And so for all these reasons, we've seen really a growing acceptance of private credit as a solution for the borrowers, and I'm talking now sub-investment grade. And those same attributes that have helped propel direct lending at the forefront, we're now also seeing it in the IG business. And so mostly I would say driven by insurance companies that are attracted by the benefit of privately placed financing, but this time around for investment grade borrowers. So if we do think about the markets today, obviously exceptionally volatile, fears of recession are growing given the volatility in policy and the behavior of markets. Latvi, talk to us what that is doing broadly in the credit space and in the private credit space in particular. How exposed is it? James just said it's a place where you can find more certainty. Yeah. I mean, look, by design, private credit and private markets actually more generally are insulated from these fluctuations in sentiment. And actually, if you look back the last couple of weeks, that's exactly what we've seen. We've seen a repricing of risk premium across the board in public credit markets and equities everywhere you look off of levels that were historically quite expensive, because actually as violent as the price action has been the last three to four weeks, if you look at basic valuation metrics on the public side, this is still not a cheap market. If I look at public IG spreads, they're still below their medians of the last 35 years. So we're not even close to pricing in the beginning of a recession, but we definitely broke out of the range. And actually, even if you look at the real economy, most of the deterioration has been in the survey data. And that's also sentiment. Actually, the irony is that the hard data looks pretty okay. We had a pretty robust actually payroll report last Friday. And so we have yet to see signs of deterioration in the real economy. And that's when private markets and private credit will respond. And so until you see signs that this sort of weakness in sentiment is translating into weakness in the real data or the hard data, I think private credit will remain insulated by that. James, how are investors responding in private credit from your observation? You know, at moment of volatility, like we're seeing today, or we saw in 22, 23, or during COVID, I would say our investors, especially the ones that have locked up capital in closed end funds, they see credit as being very defensive, an ability also to get access to cash pay and regular distribution. And they see private credit as being a good hedge against potential inflation as well, given that most of what we do when we lend to a borrower is exposed to floating rates. And so as we go around the world and we speak to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, I would say they're very constructive about private credit. And we've seen over the last decade, a pivot towards exposure from public credit to private credit. And again, here I'm referring to sub-IG. I would say another trend in the last decade has been the availability and the creation of these open-ended evergreen vehicles that are giving access to mass affluent or wealth management investors, starting with the BDCs or business development companies in the US, but also similar type vehicles outside of the US. It's a bit of a newer, I would say, history here for these vehicles, but certainly we see a lot of interest in particular when times become a bit more volatile, we see a lot of interest towards private credit. And then I mentioned on the investment grade side, what we're seeing now is a pivot from insurance companies in particular, from portfolios that are entirely public fixed income towards portfolios that are more balanced between public fixed income and private credit. And the one thing that I would add to what Lotfi said earlier is again, if you step back and you look at private credit, the performance of these platforms and these funds is solely linked to the absence of what I would say losers or defaults and subsequently losses. And so these portfolios tend to be relatively defensive, certainly when it comes to the sectors in which private credit invests, they tend to be shying away from what is a bit more cyclical, maybe a little bit more exposed to market volatility. And so if you step back and you look at the last decade, these portfolios have performed relatively well at times of increased volatility. At the end of the day, we're just talking about the debt of privately held companies. And these privately held companies are also going to be exposed to a lot of the risks in the world today. So talk to us a little bit more about the structure for those of us who do not live and breathe private credit, the structure of these transactions and these investments that really do shield from volatility. Yeah, I mean, look, on the fundamental side, of course, you're not insulated from a world in which earnings growth contracts and the economy slows down and the unemployment rate rises. But the reality is, we've never really tested what that looks like for the asset class, because it's a relatively new asset class. The last real recession that we had was 2008, 2009. Back then, the asset class was actually quite small. COVID is an interesting case study. I would argue personally that it's a pretty unique shock, to be honest, because it was very short-lived. And then more importantly, it was followed by a spectacular policy response, both on the monetary and the fiscal front. So it's really hard to look at a data point and say, OK, this is how the asset class will perform if the economy goes into recession. I would offer two observations. The first one is that, at least as far as direct lending is concerned, direct lending is part of a bigger umbrella, and that's leverage finales. Losses and defaults do go up every time you have a recession. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that whenever you see a cyclical downturn, that you'll see some pressure in terms of losses. Now, the question in my mind is, how will direct lending do relative to other adjacent markets on the public side? And that's really the high-yield bond market and the broadly syndicated loan market, where you could argue you have four decades of history. Actually, you know exactly how things play out. I agree with James. I think there's more flexibility on the private side, and so you can reduce frictions that typically arise when you have rising financial distress. So whether it's cost of bankruptcies or challenges in coordinating among the creditors, et cetera. So that's one, I think, positive aspect that plays in favor of private credit. Two, there is a misconception. I think a lot of people think of private credit as being more cyclical, lower quality. It's smaller issuers, yes. The bread and butter is still, for the most part, middle market. But I completely agree with James. If anything, it's actually more defensive than a lot of parts of public markets, certainly in high yield, which is 14% commodities exposed in the broadly syndicated loan market. And then I think the second important nuance that I would highlight is, in aggregate, losses will go up across the board in a bad state of the world with the economy in a recession. I guess the one difference between private and public is that on the private side, those losses are going to be very unevenly distributed. And what I mean by that is that a full-blown default cycle will likely catalyze a lot of dispersion across managers on the private side in a way that you will unlikely see on the public side. Why is that the case? Because on the public side, there are well-established benchmarks that fund managers are trying to beat. And so there is a high yield index that, as a fund manager on the public side, you're trying to outperform every year. There is no analog to that on the private side. And so it's hard to find sort of two private or direct lending portfolios that kind of look alike a little bit. And so from the perspective of a capital allocator, I would say that makes manager selection a far more important ingredient than on the public side. And I think one of the outcomes of a full-blown recession is basically this idea that dispersion is going to go up across managers. And so, James, if you take what Lotfi just said, are there particular areas or sectors of the market that look compelling right now relative to others? By the way, I fully agree with Lotfi about the likely dispersion amongst private credit platforms. And I think we're already starting to see in areas where we track, for instance, situations where a direct lender has taken the keys of an asset following a debt-to-equity swap or restructuring. And what we've noticed, by the way, is that in Europe, for instance, these situations tend to be with companies of smaller size and they tend to be in sectors that are more cyclical and they tend to be, for instance, buyouts that were consummated pre-2019. So the whole kind of vintage of 16 to 19, it takes about four to five years effectively for a discussion between a lender and a private equity owner to materialize into a hard default. And we're starting to see those situations in the sectors that I mentioned. Where do we find opportunities today? I would say we continue to think that there will be opportunities in particular as volatility comes back in the market in our core business, which is senior direct lending in the US, in Europe, to a lesser extent in Asia, because that's a smaller market. Why is that? Because again, if you can provide certainty to a private equity owner or to a borrower that needs capital to acquire maybe a smaller asset, that certainty is going to be even more critical. And we saw it in 2022. The M&A volumes came down in 22, but the market share of private credit increased to a very high level. And in particular in Q2 and Q3 in 2022, there were very few deals underwritten by the banks. And that's in particular important in large cap, large size buyouts. So that's one, I would say the strategies around junior debt, flexible capital, creative solutions whereby you can provide capital to borrowers, good companies, but maybe they need a bit more time in particular in an environment like this one, because IPOs may be delayed or an exit may be delayed. And the owners of these businesses need more time to create value within that asset. I think we're starting to see an increasing number of situations around the world where our capital can be very helpful to these borrowers and the owners of these businesses. We see opportunities around energy transition. We see opportunities in investment grades around this kind of pivot that is happening between public fixed income and private credit. And by the way, today you can replicate a portfolio of public fixed income. You can replicate it almost entirely on the private side. Interesting. So as James said, there's a lot of opportunity in private credit markets today. But Lafi, we do hear a lot about systemic concerns around private credit, that too much risk is being accumulated there, in part because it's less transparent than public markets and other parts of the market. Is that concern about risk, which could spill over to other parts of the financial market warranted? We've been pushing back against that narrative. Obviously, again, I said it earlier, private credit as an asset class is not immune to a cyclical downturn. And so we have to define what the risk is. Are we talking about a risk of increased losses in direct lending portfolios? I think that risk is, of course, there. You cannot... The risk profile of the asset class is very linked to the state of the economy, et cetera. But if we're talking about the risks to financial stability or what you refer to as systemic concerns, I would push back a little bit. Because to me, what is the counterfactual to a world in which an asset manager is lending to a middle market company, or increasingly, as James was saying, to a large cap company? The alternative to that would be a world in which that role is taken on by a bank, basically. And so I would argue that an asset manager doesn't have any mismatches between assets and liabilities. You take the capital from the LPs and then you deploy it generally for the same duration. So there's no misunderstanding there. Leverage is, of course, there, but it's used in a pretty reasonable dose. I mean, I'll take the BDCs as an example. There are legal caps on leverage, but it's typically 2x. And most BDCs actually never exceed 1.5x. And so I struggle a little bit to see some of the amplifying channels that we had back in 2008, 2009. And those were really mismatches between assets and liabilities, or call them liquidity mismatches, and then leverage. But those two amplifying channels are just not there today. So I do think that those concerns are overstated to some extent. And I also think that oftentimes, unfortunately, there's a bit of a confusion between cyclical risks, the risk of a rise in defaults and losses, and then risks to financial stability. I think risks to financial stability are largely overstated. The best example I can give you, and I think we had a conversation about this in March of 2023, when we had a regional banking crisis. If that crisis had happened 15 years ago, where you have like failures of two decent sized banks, the odds of a recession would have increased dramatically, in my view, because people would have looked at things like the senior loan officer survey and credit availability, et cetera. And you would have had most likely a credit crunch and eventually a recession. We did not have that in the aftermath of March of 2023. And I think part of the reason why we didn't have it is because private credit has acted as a very solid line of defense against the risk of a credit crunch, in my view. So the fact that credit has been disinterminated away from the banking system is in some ways a good line of defense against these sort of fluctuations in the business cycle. And the lower transparency doesn't bother you because of all of these factors. Again, it's a privately negotiated contract between a borrower and a lender. And the lender is obviously acting in the best interest of the investor. And so as long as that triangle basically functions very well, as long as information flows well within that triangle, I don't think there's necessarily an opacity problem. But it is a privately negotiated contract, obviously. Very enlightening, Lotfi. Thank you so much. Lots of food for thought. Thanks, James. Thanks, Lotfi. Always a pleasure to have you on Exchanges.

I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I'm joined again by Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, and Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in the Global Markets Research Group. Jan, Dom, it's great to have you back on Exchanges. Thank you. Thanks. Jan, it's been a week for the ages, and so much has happened since we last sat down in mid-February. At that time, you believed that tailwinds in the economy were more likely to trump tariff headwinds, but we, of course, since have gotten what can only be described as a seismic shift in tariff policy from the Trump administration that companies and investors are now grappling with. So, first, catch us up on the implications of those shifts for your economic outlook. Are we facing recession at this point? Yeah, I mean, if we go back two or three months, we thought coming into 2025 that tailwinds would probably trump tariffs. That was the title of our outlook, and that was when we thought tariffs would rise by maybe four percentage points or so if you take the average US tariff rate. Now, it's much higher than that, and we now think that tariffs will trump the tailwinds, and we have a much more cautious view on the US economic growth outlook. Tariffs basically weigh on growth via three main channels. Number one, you get a price increase which eats into households' real income and thereby cuts consumption. Number two, tariff increases tend to tighten financial conditions. Obviously, we've seen that in spades over the last week and a half. And then number three, uncertainty about trade policy, like other types of uncertainty, make it less advantageous for firms to make capital investment decisions, so they sit on their hands, and that weighs on growth as well. Now, how big are these effects? Our estimate, and this is very rough, but our estimate is that a one percentage point increase in the average US tariff rate boosts inflation by something like 10 basis points, or boosts the price level by about 10 basis points, and hits growth by something like 10 basis points as well. So if you have a four or five percentage point increase in the tariff rate, that's approximately where we were two months ago, that impact is manageable. That's half a point, and there are plenty of other factors that go in either direction, and it doesn't put the economy close to a recession. At 20 to 25 percentage points, which is where we were a few days ago before President Trump delayed part of these tariffs by three months, that impact looked recessionary, because then you're talking about two to two and a half percentage points of growth impact, and the economy is only growing, trend growth rate is maybe 2%. So where are we now? We pulled back a little bit. We're in the 15 to 20 percentage point range for the increase in the tariff rate, and that puts us, our best guess is, to low but still slightly positive growth, but it's hard to estimate all of this, and it certainly could be recessionary. We're at 45% recession probability. We had briefly moved to a recession baseline before the delay, and now we're back to close to 50-50, but in any case, very weak in terms of growth, only 0.5% Q4 to Q4 US GDP growth this year. And what is the inflation expectation at this point? For inflation, we're at 3.5% for core PCE. We've been running in sort of a 2.5% to 3% range for quite a while, and the latest inflation numbers, both CPI and PPI, have actually been a little bit better, but all of that is for March, didn't really have a meaningful tariff impact in it, and we think we'll see an acceleration of close to a percentage point from here. So even if we are not forecasting recession at this point, we are looking at, as you said, much lower growth, much higher inflation than before these tariff announcements. Where does that leave the Fed? It seems like a very difficult spot. Oh, it's very difficult for the Fed, of course. This is the sort of shock that makes it very hard to know which way to go, even before you get to the magnitude, and I think it's going to really depend on two questions. One, as inflation in the short term is sure to rise and probably rise pretty significantly, that's a done deal, but how do your expectations change for inflation a year out, two years out, the sort of horizon for monetary policy? And that's going to depend a lot on what happens to inflation expectations. Do inflation expectations remain anchored or do they rise a lot, which would then cause very significant second-round effects and potentially higher inflation on a more sustained basis? And there are a number of indicators. They're somewhat contradictory. Generally, survey measures of inflation expectations have gone up. Market measures of inflation expectations, at least beyond the very near term, still look well-behaved. So it's an open question and we're going to have to watch it. Our expectation would be that inflation expectations long-term remain reasonably anchored. And number two is the unemployment rate rising. So far, while we've seen some weaker economic indicators, especially in surveys, we have not really seen a meaningful deterioration in the labor market. If and when that happens, that's going to be important for the Fed. It's partly important because it feeds into their longer-term inflation forecast, but it's also important because it's directly part of their dual mandate. So yeah, our best guess with our baseline forecast is that there's going to be a little bit of moderate easing. We have 75 basis points of cuts in the current baseline forecast. So basically June, July, and September. But I would say the range around that is very wide. It's very possible that we don't get cuts at all if the economy holds up a little bit better and the inflation numbers are more concerning. But if the economy were to go into recession, and again, we're close to 50-50 on that, then I think they would cut a lot more. And maybe 200 basis points, even 200 basis points would be quite a modest amount of easing by the standards of past recessions. Now, I think there are good reasons why it would be more modest because of the nature of the shock, but 200 basis points would be a more meaningful amount. And so when we look at the probability-weighted path of the funds rate, if I take these three scenarios and calculate a very rough probability-weighted path, we think that we could certainly see more easing than what's currently priced in the market. In fact, when we compare our path with current market pricing, it's a little bit more aggressive, despite the fact that our current baseline forecast is still that we just about skate by with modestly positive growth. Interesting. Dom, let me bring you into the conversation. Obviously, the markets have been incredibly volatile during this period, but I wanna start by asking about the rates market off the back of Jan's comments on the Fed. There's been a lot of questions about why treasuries actually fell and bond yields rose amid this market turmoil. We generally think of treasuries as the ultimate safe haven asset. So what's your view on what's driving those moves and do you think this treasury route can continue? Yeah, more than somewhat surprising, I would say. And it is very unusual to see that mix of yields rising with the dollar weakening and equities falling, certainly in the way and the magnitudes that we've seen over the last kind of week or so. I do think there were sort of two phases of that. I think in the initial phase, I do think some of the constraints and the complexity for the Fed that Jan was talking about, this kind of tension between the inflation and growth side played a role in the immediate aftermath. We saw treasury yields fall initially as equities came down, but they fell a lot less than you would normally expect given the magnitude of the equity declines and given what we've seen in some of the prior growth scares that we've had over the last couple of years. And so that already spoke to kind of some of the tensions that Jan referenced between the kind of growth and inflation sides. Coming into this week, then things changed much more sharply. You saw a lot more pressure on the back end of the curve. Again, I think some of that was sort of worries about the Fed perhaps being forced to ease into an environment where the inflation picture is still very uncomfortable and set to get more uncomfortable. I think there's also been a little bit of reemergence of worry about the fiscal backdrop, the acknowledgement that recessionary environment, much weaker growth is not going to be helpful for the budget and the public debt situation. But against the backdrop of that, I think two big new issues have sort of come into play that really drove the last leg and the more kind of panicked action that we saw in treasury markets, particularly since Tuesday. I think one was worries that foreign investors might start to take a step back more meaningfully from the treasury market. We saw a pretty difficult bond auction on Tuesday and some signs that maybe demand for showing up at those auctions was falling back. We haven't yet seen strong kind of broad evidence of the footprint that there's really been a big withdrawal by foreign investors when you look across markets, but definitely anticipation and worry about that being something that might be coming. And the second thing is alongside that unwinds of very big levered positions. I think particularly people positioning for wider swap spreads that came under pressure as that kind of first round of fear took place. Market's been extremely illiquid across a whole bunch of different asset classes. And I think what you've seen is then the kind of cumulative effect of those forces pushing yields up and then some sort of heightened fear that's gonna continue. I think with the tariff pause, at least the pause on that sort of segment of the tariffs, we saw kind of a little bit of a reprieve. We had a somewhat better auction yesterday, but 30-year yields really haven't come down in a meaningful way yet. The situation feels very fragile still. So it's always hard to know how long this will last, but I do think it's gonna be hard for investors to treat longer data treasuries as a comfortable safe haven, given what they've just seen. And I do think there's a pretty good chance we'll see new highs in those yields over the coming weeks. The irony is that the inflation numbers and the near term, the recent data has actually been better than expected, like meaningfully better this week. So without that fresh shock, we'd probably be taking credit for somewhat lower yields. But I think these other dynamics are still going to overwhelm it, and there's gonna be a lot of worry and nervousness about whether people are just going to take a broader step back from the allocations to US bonds. Yeah, I think I saw when I left my desk on the way over here that yields were up, again, this morning. So we'll see what the future brings. But as we've been discussing, markets in general have been extremely volatile. I mean, these equity moves, I mean, the whiplash is real. When you think about what the market is pricing right now across assets, what looks appropriately priced for the risk we're facing and what looks mispriced? Yeah, it's obviously a moving target. I'm sort of conscious that whatever I say now, by the time this is released, which will be soon, but by the time anyone listens to this, at any future point, the observations could be out of date. The process we've been engaged in is essentially to take the views that Jan and the team are coming up with on the economic front, these kind of shifting scenarios, both the central case and the risk scenarios around US growth, and try and see, broadly speaking, whether we think, as well as we can, that's reflected in the way markets are pricing. When we look at that right here, after the announcement of the delay to that portion of the reciprocal tariffs, we obviously saw a big kind of relief rally in equities on Wednesday. And when we looked at that sort of Wednesday night after that relief, it looked like we were pricing growth essentially somewhere close to the baseline that Jan outlined, so low positive, non-recessionary, but very weak growth. And so the problem with that is that, as Jan laid out, we're still seeing a very significant, not quite 50% chance that a recession will occur. And so essentially you should be pricing some discount to that baseline to give you something that lies in between those two outcomes at a minimum. And so certainly as of Wednesday night, it looked like we had removed that cushion more or less entirely in terms of the way things were priced. And we've put a little bit back since then. The market has come off from those very high levels on Wednesday, but our view is still, I think, that the market is vulnerable to any signs that recession might be coming. So it's not that we're pricing much more optimistic outcomes than that base case, it's just that we still see a meaningful risk that you don't end up there and the market should really be offering you protection and a discount against that. I think because of that, our bias is to think that equities and credit should, if they were kind of correctly priced or fairly priced to that distribution of outcomes, they should be lower. And as Jan said, that the market should probably be pricing somewhat more Fed easing along the curve, just as you wait the two different prospects. And so the biases is that after that relief, we got into a place where we were again, underpricing some of that downside risk. So the takeaway for me is that there is more downside ahead if there is obviously a more, we are not that close to pricing a recessionary outcome at this point. Yeah, there's no doubt that if we get a recessionary outcome, I think there's meaningful downside still in lots of different areas of the asset class. There are very few things even at the worst of this downturn that in level terms we're pricing what we think of as a full recession. I would say we haven't really priced above the baseline forecast. So I guess the kind of lucky version of this is we track along the baseline and then, that you don't need a further meaningful adjustment on that basis. But I still think the skew of risks is still like the upside scope there is still limited by the fact that growth is going to be weak and we're gonna be kind of tracking along that knife edge for a while. And if you get that downside case, yeah, there's still meaningful room to price it. And let's not forget, we were at extremely high starting levels before all of this, pricing a very good growth outlook at that point. Yeah, I think that's part of the issue. The changes have been huge, but the starting levels were high. And so what we've really done is taken ourselves from very optimistic levels of growth to what are now pretty modest levels of growth and much more pessimistic levels. But I don't think we've swung all the way to pricing proper recessionary risk. So if we head there, that's where the vulnerability still is. So Jan, it seems like the market is still holding at least some hope perhaps that we will see these trade deals, we'll see some relief continue. But ultimately, there's just tremendous uncertainty about that. And if we zone in on uncertainty itself, how much damage is that in itself doing? And is any of that damage really somewhat permanent at this point? Can we unwind all that's happened? It's very hard to give a confident answer to that, because if I go back to the three channels through which this trade war is weighing on growth, income effects, financial conditions effects, and uncertainty effects, the uncertainty effect is the hardest to estimate because they're not really great metrics. You can put a number on that. On the FCI financial conditions, at least you can sort of measure them as they change. And I think our models on that are generally pretty good. But for uncertainty, it's harder. Our working assumption is half a percentage point to one percentage point off of growth because of the uncertainty measures. But the range around that is, I mean, the true range is probably much wider and probably skewed to the downside because some of these uncertainty measures, trade policy uncertainty, I mean, they're at unprecedented levels. We haven't seen this sort of thing. And there's also the risk that it becomes more nonlinear at some point. To the other question of whether we can unwind this if things calm down a bit, to some degree, no doubt, but can we fully unwind it? I think that's going to be very difficult. So some drag on economic activity is very likely. Now, that's a statement sort of about the level of investment. The level of investment, I think, is going to be lower than it otherwise would be because of this, probably for the foreseeable future. Of course, the changes can look a little bit different if you have a really big shock to uncertainty in the short term, and then the uncertainty diminishes, then you can get a partial rebound. But it is likely to be a very significant issue for corporate decision makers in particular for a long time to come. Yes, can you imagine how corporates are managing this and investors as well? I mean, if you think about investors managing this uncertainty, what are you seeing in terms of actions they're taking? Are they hedging? And if so, how are they hedging? Yeah, look, I think the bottom line is it's extremely challenging environment and this level of volatility moves in both directions, just very difficult to manage effectively. I think what you're seeing at a high level, I think probably the most basic thing is people just reducing risk and just getting more defensive in their positioning. And I would say more diversification over time away from US assets, but also people emphasizing diversification more in their portfolios in general. You did see increased demand for protection going into the April event. Alec had been fairly explicit that the risks were skewed to the downside. I think that resonated with a decent portion of the investor community. So buying puts in equities, in credit, in oil, all of that, there was definitely kind of increased level of activity and that's been pretty valuable in protecting people, at least to a degree. You never have enough of that protection when things go bad, but- Sorry, and you're referring to Alec Phillips, our political economist, who kind of said, look, you gotta be concerned about the downside risk here. Yes, the chances of a negative surprise were rising and that was the direction in which things were more likely to play out. The problem now is those hedges are extremely expensive. So you're not finding people, I think, queue up to do that at this point. That was something you could do ahead of the event that is harder to do afterwards. I think part of the additional challenge, which we touched on before, is that the kind of conventional things people have done in other assets to protect themselves, buy treasuries or to protect your equity position or be long dollars, which has been a popular way of kind of protecting equity positions, those things have not worked. So, you know, there's obviously, people are looking beyond their bonds as a safe haven. I think front end of the yield curve, that's been a little bit more reliable. There've been constraints there, but those yields have come down. People think a bit more comfortable using that as a protective asset. Long positions in safe haven currencies, so not the dollar anymore, but yen and Swiss franc, and I would say gold, which has also been a very popular hedge. Those are things that continue to perform quite well and have been reliably seeing a lot more interest in that. But I do think the kind of broad problem is that once the event takes place, volatility generally explodes. It gets very expensive to buy options and so to hedge that way. And so I think people are just more focused on those kind of asset allocation issues, making sure they have the risk exposures that they're comfortable with. And as I said, part of that is this diversification into kind of non-US safe havens that is probably feeding some of the dynamics that we talked about with FX and rates. Right, we just had a conversation with Dan Struyven, our commodity analyst, earlier this week. He was pretty optimistic that gold was gonna be an effective hedge and we're seeing that play out at this point. Don, let me turn back to you because at least at this moment, it could change, but at this moment, it seems like China is really in focus, a target of this tariff policy. So what do we think is ahead for the economy in China off the back of all of this? Yes, that is the main focus at the moment. We've seen in total 145 percentage point increase in US tariffs on China. China has retaliated, 125. So that's the latest. Obviously, the situation is very in flux. What we have done with our China forecast is two things. We have put in more stimulus, in particular, another 20 basis point cut in the policy rate. So there's now 60 basis points. We've put in more fiscal, bigger augmented fiscal deficit, additional property easing, but nevertheless, we've cut our GDP growth forecast as well. So we went from 4.5% to 4% for this year and then from 4% to 3.5% for next year because it will be hard to offset all of this. However, there are also some very big questions. Of course, we don't know how long this phase of the US-China trade war really lasts and that depends on how much pain is there in China, how much pain is there in the US, what's the pressure for settlement. At the moment, it doesn't look like it's very close, but that could, of course, change. Number two, I think there are levers that could be taken to reduce the pain, exemptions for particular product categories or potentially more tolerance for effectively rerouting trade and being a bit more relaxed about rules of origin, which is a similar kind of thing where the headline tariff rates might continue to be very high, but the impact of those headline tariff rates might be a little bit lower. So it's a fluid situation. China is definitely under pressure here. Right now, it doesn't look like they are really willing to give way and yeah, they are going to be suffering in terms of economic growth and the US is as well. We've made bigger downward revisions to the US than to China. That continues to be true even after this latest round of revisions, but we will see how the Chinese economy holds up. Are there any economies that actually look well-positioned given all this news? My basic answer would be probably not many because I think it's very much a negative-sum game. And if it's a negative-sum game, you're going to have a lot more losers than winners. Trade is positive-sum. Economic exchange in general is positive-sum. That's why people engage in transactions, but this is a negative-sum game. And I actually just looked at the GDP forecast changes that we've made over the last four weeks. So out of around 25 of the biggest economies that we forecast, we've had, I think, 21 or 22 countries cutting growth forecasts for this year. And then we've had a very small number unchanged, very volatile EM economies like Brazil, Turkey, Russia. And then we had one increase for Argentina, which again is a very volatile economy. So basically, we are seeing losers and the degree of cuts differs a lot, but there have been downward revisions in the vast majority of economies that we cover. Interesting. Dom, you mentioned this briefly, but before we conclude, I do want to dig a little bit more into the dollar because it has been a very surprising move. We expected coming into any extreme tariff scenario, that would be good for the dollar, but obviously we've seen the absolute opposite. So why is that? And basically, is this narrative that the dollar stronger, is that dead? Yeah, look, it's been a big shift here, both what the market's doing and our own views on that. Last year and early this year, as you said, the conventional story, but also the way the market reacted to tariff news was pretty consistent. The dollar went up, generally speaking, when you saw kind of increased tariff risk or increased tariff proposals. And that is sort of the conventional way in which, at least without sort of significant retaliation, you would expect currencies to move on those tariff announcements. I think that already started to shift ahead of this. We started to see signs that was shifting late January, early February, already in the Canada and Mexico tariff episodes. And I think in the initial phase, sort of reflective of two things, I think one is realization that there would be retaliation, that this is sort of a two-sided story, but I think a lot of it was also growing concern about the fragility of the US economic performance, signs that US growth was softening and signs that the uncertainty around policy on top of that was creating unique risks for US growth. And I think what we've seen is that narrative has only grown since then. As Jan said, we're cutting our US growth forecast now more than we're cutting our China growth forecast. That itself is an indication that we see a kind of very different set of risks from the sort of 2018, 2019 trade story, for instance, where we would have said that the damage for China was gonna be meaningfully worse than the damage for the US economy. And I think beyond that, the bigger issue and the one that's emerged, which we touched on, is that you've had a large overweight build in US assets, lots of kind of outperformance of the US over a long period of time. So foreign investors very exposed to the US economy. The dollar's been strong. They've generally not felt they needed to hedge that exposure. And now people, they were starting to question that allocation a little early in the year, just on kind of relative economic performance, some better news out of Europe and China and some softer news out of the US. But what you've added on top of that is a lot of uncertainty about what the policy environment's gonna look like here, the institutional environment and foreign investors. I think have become a lot more nervous about the extent of that allocation and that overweight that they have for the US. We definitely have seen a sharp increase in questions from people about the risks to that position. And I think when you go through an episode like the one we've just gone through over the last couple of weeks, it just heightens those risks. To see treasuries sell off in this environment, to see an episode where equities are down and dollar is weakening, which for an unhedged foreign investor is a sort of double whammy that you're not used to seeing that frequently, those are just going to kind of confirm the notion that these exposures and these risk exposures that people are carrying are uncomfortable for them. And so I think what you are seeing at some high level is the beginning of a shift in just preferences for US assets overall relative to where we've been on the basis of some of these moves. And I think that is probably going to continue. We as a team, our FX team shifted their forecast view pretty substantially recently. And the forecast is now for kind of extended dollar weakness through the course of the year. I think there's some self-fulfilling element to that, that the more that is reinforced by the way the market behaves, the more people, as I said, are going to kind of question the exposures that they already have. And given where we've come from, there's probably quite a lot of room for that process still to run. I think it's a little harder if you look at the mix of currencies, cyclical and risky currencies in an environment like this, it's hard for the dollar to weaken a lot against that group. But if you think of the core group, euro, yen, Swiss franc, maybe even sterling, the kind of core G10 alternatives, I think there's room for that, that reversal and that appreciation against the dollar that we've been seeing to continue. And it's seeing one of the interesting things with this pause is that we, again, we've had reversals to some degree in some assets, but the dollar weakening trend has continued through all of this. So let me just conclude by asking you both what you're watching from here. Jan? I mean, I think a lot of the markets issues that Dom just talked about are very much top of mind and not just for investors, but also in terms of processing how the economy is going to get through this. Because in the past, if you look at significant periods of volatility and downturns, there was always a lot of room for US policymakers to ease aggressively because they were able to rely on the safe haven status of the US dollar and US treasuries. If that's no longer true to the same degree, then that could also constrain their room to some degree. So I think this is a really first order economic issue as well. I think in terms of tariff policy, the focus is really going to be on what happens between the US and China. I think on other things, yeah, there are negotiations going on, but that's not quite as urgent probably. There's also the question of, again, how much are these extremely high tariff rates on China really going to bite around exemptions and potential rerouting. And then otherwise, we're going to be more focused on the data. The first order, first tier data releases are probably still not that useful. We had some good inflation releases this week, didn't really matter. Last week's employment report didn't really matter. Next week's retail sales report probably won't really matter because it's going to be distorted potentially by pre-buying. So the things to focus on are probably some of the surveys. We've seen huge declines in expectations. Current conditions, both businesses and consumers still look okay. So we're going to have to see whether that changes. We'll be focused on the weekly jobless claims numbers. I would say so far, we haven't really seen any significant signs of increases in layoff activity, either in the claims numbers or in higher frequency measures like announced layoffs. We've seen the doge layoffs in the federal government, but outside of that, there hasn't really been anything, but that would be a very important shift. And yeah, otherwise business confidence matters and hard economic activity to the extent we can get something very timely. But it'll be probably similarly busy as it has been, but the focus might shift a little bit more to the consequences. Dan. I was going to say, we're going to be watching Yan, but, and I mean that somewhat flippantly, but I do think, like I said, the process that we're going through as a team is a lot of it is, where is the economic outcomes? Where do Yan and the team think the economic outcomes, how do they think that's evolving? And we're looking at the pricing of that in the market. And that process I think is going to be over the next couple of months. The things that Yan said, I think in terms of watching things, obviously China, U.S. tariffs, and this kind of recession watch in the data seems like that's going to be the most critical element of that. On the market side specifically, the one new thing, which is something you never want to be doing, but always have to when these huge shifts take place is we're watching for measures of market stress for the first time again, really since COVID, looking at measures of funding stress, measures of liquidity stress, and just trying to keep an eye on the notion of whether there are secondary effects and signs that, as we started to see a little bit in the treasury market earlier this week, that markets are not functioning properly. Overall, outside that kind of treasury pocket, mostly this has been a story of illiquid markets rather than dysfunctional markets. But I think the risks have risen and we're going to be keeping a much closer eye on that than we have done for several years now. Yan, Dom, thanks so much for joining me today. I look forward to continuing this conversation. There's going to be a lot to talk about. Thank you. Thank you, no doubt. This episode was recorded on Friday, April 11th, 2025. I'm Alison Aythen.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-04-09 16:14:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Recession watch: How to hedge now\n**Episode ID:** 4504\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nThe recent historic tariff announcements have raised the risk of recession. So how can investors hedge against this risk? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by Don Stroyven, our co-head of global commodities research, who's making the case that oil and gold are particularly well positioned to protect investors against recession risk today. Don, it's great to have you back on the program. It's great to be on, Alison. Thank you so much. So, Don, I want to start with gold. We think of it as a safe haven asset. We think of it as an asset you want to own in a portfolio when the economy is struggling, when risk markets are struggling. And in fact, gold, as you're going to tell us, has had a tremendous performance in the recent period. But it's been somewhat surprising, I think, to a lot of investors that that hasn't been the case every day. In fact, in some of the most volatile days in the recent week, I should say, gold sold off along with risky assets. So first, give us some insight into those moves. How do you explain them? Yeah. So I think it's mostly because of forced selling, basically investors suffering losses on portfolios of risky assets, such as equities, and being forced to come up with liquidity to meet those margin calls. And one of the possibilities through which you can meet these margin calls is by selling gold. This is not that unusual. We have seen this before. But what happens typically once equity volatility stabilizes, spec positioning tends to rise back up. And in fact, if you look at price action of the last week, silver was down 11 percent. Gold was down 4 percent. But investors are more reluctant to liquidate gold positions because the long term outlook remains structurally very bullish and because we think it should be a great hedge against a recession risk. Well, when you think about that positioning, though, just to be clear, investors are still quite long gold. If you think about how much unwound in recent days, where would you put that? Yeah, so before the announcements of the tariffs, we were around percentile 85 or so of the distribution. We don't have the data yet for this week, but we think that positioning is now probably pretty close to the median, to the historical average based on the partial positioning data through Thursday and the price action we have seen. So in other words, positioning is quite clean. And so I think this is a very attractive entry point to enter long gold positions, especially as a hedge, both against the general risk of a recession in the US or globally, but also given the particularly important role that gold could play to mitigate against the likely drivers of potential recession, namely tail policy risk from the US, whether it's on the trade policy side, pressure on the Fed or other changes in US institutions and governance that may erode the trust of global investors in US assets. Gold would do really well in all of those potential scenarios for a recession. We're still above $3,000 per troy ounce on gold. So where do you think gold is headed? Obviously, our discussion is mostly around hedging risk, so it's a hedge, but you actually have an outright bullish call on gold. That's the beauty. In the base case where the US economy stagnates but avoids a recession, we have gold rising another 10% by year end, $3,300 per troy ounce. But if you look at the risks around that forecast, they are very much skewed to the upside. In fact, we think that gold could rally to $4,250 per troy ounce by year end if we were to see a recession, which would really boost ETF investors' demand for gold, as the Fed would cut probably by around 200 basis points. If central banks were to continue the very rapid purchase rhythm of gold over the last few months, it would get there too. And finally, the third condition you need to get this very big upside would be that uncertainty stays high and spec positioning would actually bounce back and go to high levels. And I think it is an extreme upside scenario, but if you put those conditions together, it is a fairly plausible scenario for global markets and the US economy in the next year. Interesting. Let's turn to oil. You have cut your oil price forecast pretty dramatically. You actually are below where the market forwards are pricing right now. So very bearish from that perspective. Not entirely surprising because we obviously have seen concerns about recession rising. You associate that with lower oil demand. But you make the case that oil is kind of set for a double whammy here if we think about the risks ahead. Talk to us about why you are so negative on oil right now. Yeah. So Brent oil is trading currently around $64 per barrel. By year-end, we are at $62 per barrel. But by the end of next year, 2026, we are at $55 per barrel. And the risks here are skewed to the downside. The two key assumptions we're making for our forecast where that oil would decline significantly for 2026 is, one, the US economy avoids a recession, but it's a close call. And second, the supply increases from OPEC plus will be moderate. But the risks to both assumptions point to potentially lower prices than our base case. For instance, if you were to see a global slowdown and a typical US recession, but keeping OPEC policy constant, Brent by the end of 2026 would be in the mid-40s. If you were to see a combination of both a full unwind of OPEC voluntary production cuts and a global slowdown, our models would point to Brent by the end of next year just under 40. And so we think that oil puts, basically insurance policies protecting investors against lower oil prices, are really quite attractive right now. What is the rationale for OPEC to be increasing production into a slowdown? Yeah, so I think that the starting point is a starting point of high spare capacity. Roughly 6% of global oil production capacity is currently shut in, in countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, or Russia. And OPEC has been stabilizing the market, has been supporting prices for several years now. And so patience levels have diminished somewhat over time, in particular because compliance with production cuts from countries such as Kazakhstan and Iraq has diminished. And so I think that OPEC plus has decided to bring back production to markets precisely when global markets are becoming more concerned about downside to the demands outlook for two reasons, incentivize better compliance from the countries that are not producing in line with the quota, and also trying to slow down U.S. shale supply growth. And in fact, we have now cut our U.S. production forecast and are now looking for declines in U.S. production. But aren't they shooting themselves in the foot? I mean, I'm asking the obvious question here, but they're also going to suffer the lower prices off the back of this. How does that work? Yes, I think it all, the calculus very much depends on are the production increases successful in restoring cohesion and compliance? Are the production cuts successful in slowing down U.S. shale growth? And the jury is still out there, and it very much depends on how the other countries and the U.S. shale complex will react. And we are starting to reach oil prices that are becoming the breakeven point, so a pressure point for increasingly large number of oil producers. We think that the average breakeven price in WTI terms for the U.S. producers is around $50 per barrel. So we're starting to get closer to those pressure points. So if I am hearing you correctly, Don, we think there's going to be a demand shock to oil. There's going to be a positive supply shock, which seems counterintuitive, but as you explained, makes sense from an OPEC point of view. So ultimately, less demand, more supply, much lower oil prices. So if we put that in the context of how we started this conversation and recession hedges, we're going to see a lot of assets falling amid recession concerns. But are you saying that oil, let alone gold, but oil could also play a role as a recession hedge here? Yes. So the title of our 2025 outlook was Stay Selective and Hedge the Tales. Our new tagline is It's Time to Hedge with Commodities. With long gold positions and short oil positions, especially for 2026, where our forecast is well below the fort and where the risks are skewed to downside. Why? Is it attractive to use oil puts as a recession hedge? Both because you have this double whammy, more supply and less demand. But also because the cost of insurance implied volatility, for instance, in oil markets is still cheap. It's still low, for instance, to the cost of insurance implied volatility in equity markets. Interesting. So ultimately, though, are we seeing investors doing this? What are you seeing investors, how are they operating in the commodity space at this point? Yeah, we have seen a surge in trading volumes for puts. So insurance policies are protecting against lower oil prices after a period of pretty low transaction volumes. So markets are sort of waking up to these downside risks when they have already partially realized. I mean, I know you probably don't have precise data on this, but if we think about who's putting on those puts, is it macro investors? Is it equity investors who are looking for a put? How do you think about the type of investor who's engaging in this activity at this point? Yeah, macro investors, in particular equity investors, because if you get negative growth surprises, it's obviously negative for equities. For bonds, you have some potential hedging benefits there as well. And then the oil producers themselves, especially U.S. oil producers or oil producers elsewhere in the world who are at the higher end of the cost curve and who want to protect against potential additional downside price pressure. Right. So that's a different kind of hedging in a way, hedging your actual business model. So how else are smart investors engaging in commodity markets right now at this really uncertain and volatile moment? So I think we have seen a lot of investor interest in the implications of tariffs on U.S. metals. And that has led to some very big moves in the regional differences in prices in metals across the world. And there continue to be some opportunities as the tariffs on U.S. copper imports are still very likely ahead of us. They're not announced yet. I think investors with a very long investment horizon continue to stay focused on the pretty positive long-term copper outlook. Yes, if you see a global slowdown, copper prices are likely to fall, but that would probably not derail the bullish outlook and the deficit would simply delay them. In fact, if you have lower prices now, you know, you would actually support demand and discourage supply. And you may potentially sow the seeds of a tighter market down the road. So a lot of our investor clients are still very focused on the structurally pretty interesting copper outlook, but cyclically, it may be more challenging in coming quarters. Thanks so much, Don. Always so insightful. Thanks a lot, Alison. This episode was recorded on Tuesday, April 8th, 2025. I'm Alison Nathan.

I'm Alison Mass, Chairman of Investment Banking in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking and Markets, and your host for today's episode. I'm thrilled to be joined by David Gross, co-managing partner of Bain Capital. Bain Capital is one of the most prominent private investment firms in existence, with about $185 billion in assets under management. David is a founding member of Bain Capital's Asia business, and he's been the driving force behind some of the largest and most consequential private investments in Asia. I'm excited to hear David's views about the global market for private investment. So David, thank you for joining us. Great to be here. Thanks for having me, Alison. So we are picking a very interesting time to record this podcast. There are real questions about the outlook for the global economy, which provides an investment firm like yours, like Bain Capital, which has a global portfolio, a unique perspective. So before we get into that, I'd love to spend some time on your views about the macro landscape globally, and I'll put you on the spot and ask you, are there countries or asset classes that you think are particularly well-situated or particularly at risk in this very moment? Sure. I mean, the answer is yes. We continue to think a lot of sectors in the United States are going to have significant tailwinds because there's been a lot of savings, a lot of capacity to spend, significant government intervention in the economy to drive stimulus that will be a positive for manufacturing businesses and other ways that the United States is set up to actually perform quite well in terms of energy prices and obviously the really strong position in technology. It's sector by sector, but this notion that the U.S. sits in a pretty good place from a geopolitical perspective, energy, inherent growth is still there. We're very bullish on Japan. Japan is a large market that's taken a long time to develop, but we're starting to finally see the convergence of forces that are going to turn this into a really big buyout market, but a market for really all the asset classes in which we should participate. And you will see some pockets in Europe that are going to see some interesting trends. Germany has had a really tremendous set of changes that we've seen really up against a lot of pressures. You combine that with large German corporates that have big portfolios and there'll be, I think, a wave of divestitures, export facing businesses that have faced some pressure that will also need some new partners. So it might be a little bit contrarian, but some of the tougher European economies now from a price value perspective are going to start to look pretty interesting. So you talk about Asia and I've been working with you and with Bain for over 20 years and I remember having conversations with you in the mid 2000s about Asia and which countries that you wanted to plant your flag in and where we saw opportunities and we compared a lot of really interesting notes back then. But you were one of the first private equity firms to really establish a presence there. And you notably started your career in Japan where the firm has been doing business for almost 20 years now, right? Yes. So before we dive into your career in Asia, can you talk about the drivers behind the globalization of private equity and alternative investments more generally? So as you know, this was a very U.S. centric business. Part of it was just that's where the funding and the financial innovation started. But also this notion that private equity could be a useful tool in terms of corporate governance, in terms of driving efficiency at companies with a long-term focus, the ability to add value, a low cost of capital was kind of a unique phenomenon to the United States. And it's not like that doesn't apply to Europe and Asia, but there were other constraints there just in terms of the process of gaining corporate control and making investments. But probably more importantly, just the cultural acceptance, the notion that an outside party could come in with ownership, governance, and capital and do something that was good, help businesses. And that was a process that really had to be proven in each of these geographies, whether it's places like the UK and Germany, or whether it's places like Japan. And so we started early because we knew there was a lot of spade work that had to be done. I mean, that you really had to prove this by changing businesses, making an impact, getting them growing again. And there was some skepticism, I would say, in the early days, for sure. And then there's cultural aspects in terms of just you need to have deep teams in each of these geographies. We talk about being global, but it's really about being local and having people you can trust to have great relationships and becoming part of the cultural fabric, and all that takes a lot of time. So we needed to start early. We needed to make big long-term investments, and we needed to let the process play out in terms of taking kind of a US Western approach and adapting it for the local conditions, explaining it and educating all the market participants, whether it's the local banks or management teams, that this would be something that would be good for the economies. And you also had to have staying power, because I think you know better than anyone that so many of your, quote, peer organizations were in Japan, out of Japan, in Japan, out of Japan. And you've been consistently there for decades. So I do want to talk about Japan a little bit more, which is, why is it a particularly appealing market for investors like Bain? Well, I'd say one is the value equation is still very attractive. There are a lot of great Japanese businesses with good technologies that, you know, come from the R&D focus, the extremely high standards of education in the country. And those are all tremendous assets. But for various historical reasons, there hasn't been this pursuit of productivity and efficiency. There've been some other reasons why industries have remained fragmented, not consolidated. And we made investment in a drugstore chain in Japan. And it's interesting to note that Japan is one of the big developed economies that doesn't have big national drugstore chains, because it's been a pretty local, family-owned business type of contract. And so we saw some of these things in the United States, founder-owned businesses, fragmentations, corporates have big portfolios that are core and non-core businesses. But in Japan, the process of moving that towards what we see in the United States was, it just took longer. And on top of that, you know, I think people came to Japan and they left Japan. Back then, the terminology was this passing over Japan, meaning you skipped over Japan and you went right to China. And it's a hard market to build relationships and it takes time and patience. And so because of that, you've got really great opportunity, but not as many competitors pursuing that opportunity. That's changing a bit right now. It's really changing now. But that equation was very interesting. So you could invest in businesses at, I'd say, good value relative to the current earnings, but most importantly, relative to the potential earnings by having a hands-on approach. And that's the bread and butter of what we had always done at Bain Capital, going back to the early days in the United States. We had this consulting value-addition-oriented approach with a lot of capabilities around that. And we built that all up in Japan so that we could come in there, not just say, hey, we're going to hire a managing team and set a new plan, but we're going to jump in there with our people hand-in-hand and help bring some of these other practices that we had learned through 40 years of investing in different vertical industries. And that accelerated the process of change at the companies. And if you're buying things at relatively good prices with attractive capital structures and you can get declining businesses or flat businesses to grow even 3%, 4%, with some margin improvement, it can lead to really interesting returns. So it's really that economic proposition that was very attractive to us. So one region we haven't talked about yet is India. And for a long time, there's been a great deal of enthusiasm about India among global investors. Favorable growth dynamics, supportive policies for business, and a growing middle class are seen as important catalysts. Do you share that enthusiasm? Yes, we share the enthusiasm. We've been interested in advocates of India for many years before I think everything had kind of come together. It always had this promise of a large economy, a growing middle class, really positive demographics, and just extremely low penetration in almost any product category you would look at. But the hope had not always been fulfilled because the markets were volatile. When there was a global disruption, the money would kind of go out of India. The market would not be as reliable. And so you saw issues with just making investments, not being able to exit them, were the classic issues you heard about India. But we loved the IP, the just strong intellectual capability of managing teams, management capabilities, the aspirations that Indian companies had to not just be leaders in their industries, but be global. And so therefore, they wanted to work with global private equity firms who could bring the best benchmark globally, not just in India to them. And so we liked it because, again, it had this growth opportunity like in Japan, but also this fit with our model. And now you're seeing some of the other macro issues kind of get solved one by one. First of all, you have stable government. The Modi government has had a clear strategy that they've been able to execute because they stayed in office for quite a long period of time. Secondly, the markets have just matured. There's more depth in the capital markets. There's more domestic capital that's circulating. You don't have this issue of kind of hot money coming in and out, and that helps with exits. And the other big thing that's changed is you can gain control of companies. It used to be the fact that first-generation Indian owners didn't want to turn over ownership of the company. And so they're mostly minority deals. But now you see a change. And so you've got more control over your destiny, more of the levers we can bring to the table in terms of value creation to create good outcomes. So we always liked it. There were some missing pieces, and now a lot of that's coming together to make it really interesting. So we've spent some time talking about your macro views, which is fitting because you led the creation of Bain Capital's macro team. So what role does macroeconomic analysis play in Bain Capital's investment decisions, and how does that macro team contribute today? Sure. So we had always thought about ourselves as the opposite of macro investors, particularly at Bain Capital, where we were extremely analytical, and we take these bottoms-up views of industries and companies. And I think we did fail to recognize that we're all macro investors, right? There's so many exposures that can overwhelm certain things you may really like as a concrete driver of a company that you have to factor into your business. So one is just a recognition of that. The second is we don't think of ourselves at all as momentum investors. We are fundamental investors, and fundamental investment means you're doing deep research and doing a lot of work. And again, we didn't think you could do that in the macro area. But when you dig under the covers a bit, you can take a very analytical approach. You can build a macro capability. And we found that we were actually uniquely positioned to do that, because we have all these portfolio companies, all these breadth and asset classes, whether it's the credit markets, in the real estate markets, in the life sciences markets, that we've got incredibly unique and proprietary data. So the first step was, how do we bring all that data together, combined with some third-party intelligence to get a better view of what's coming around the corner? Not so much to predict the future. I don't think macro is about predicting. It's about getting a little bit ahead of the curve and creating better scenarios about, okay, if XYZ happens, how will that affect the business? And what are the things that we could be doing now to better position ourselves around that? And that's now become an embedded part of all the deals we do. But the second more interesting part is really investing behind macro opportunity, which is what I was mentioning in terms of thematics. And so we've taken to the next level of getting all of our business units together with outside experts around certain macro themes that are going to power those things we want to invest behind. Take immigration and migration patterns, a big driver of housing development in certain countries and supply-demand gaps that create some really interesting opportunities. Also a big driver of outsourcing trends. And so that's an example of tying some of these macro insights about what's happening in each country down to some investable themes. Healthcare, an incredible issue with healthcare efficiency and even the supply of healthcare. And this has led to a lot of thinking across business unit around healthcare IT and how we can bring that technology into healthcare organizations to offset pressures from reduced funding and from payer and provider pressures that you see. So kind of thinking about macro as this is another capability we should have. It's consistent with being a fundamental investor, marrying it with all the good Microsoft we do can create a lot of opportunity. Yeah, and it's smart to do. I mean, you have a global portfolio, so you do have a unique perspective. And I know some of your partners call it like scenario analysis, you know, a confluence of things happening and how is it going to impact each of your businesses and regions? So let's talk about private equity in general for a minute. There have been a lot of questions about how private equity firms are managing to return capital to LPs in this environment. I think last year was maybe the lowest percentage in 10 years that was returned. So how have you been thinking about that and how has it impacted your investment thesis, your exits and your conversations with your LPs? So it's an important topic. We get asked a lot. You know, we try to put it into some industry context, which is, you know, this has been a cyclical industry. We've seen four or five big super cycles over the last, you know, four decades we've been in business. And we just came out of a really big one. So post COVID, you saw a peak velocity that I think the peak in 21 was maybe two and a half times larger than the last peak. And generally speaking, after those peaks, you see lower years in terms of both deployment and liquidity. And so some of it's just the math that you had a big, very big deployment year to increase the base. And we're still kind of early in the recovery cycle there. So my first message would be, I'm not sure this has really played out. I think it's not surprising to see some low percentage years of distributions versus, you know, asset value. And so we're kind of in that phase. The second is that we really didn't experience a recession. Typically after these big peak velocity periods, it's been followed like a global financial crisis or the dot-com bust by a recession. And capital structures were pretty favorable. So I think the industry has had more time and cushion to be able to play this process out. So they haven't really been forced to sell. And so this gap between buyers and sellers hasn't really come to head just yet. And I think that's probably positive relative to other cycles in the industry's ability to digest it. Also recall a lot of that peak velocity was in technology. I think 50, 60% of the deployment in 2020 was in technology businesses. And those businesses, many who invested a lot in technology, believe that there's still a lot of opportunity to grow. And so combined with the patient capital structures, you'll be able to grow out of it. So I think we haven't seen exactly. I know there's a lot of reaction to the absolute numbers. But there's still some steps that we're going to see. We took a bit of a different approach to it. We were much more value focused in that last super cycle we did to technology investing. But we were pretty careful on the price growth metric. We were very focused on multiple contraction. We were concerned about low interest rates. And that when interest rates go up, you're going to see a multiple impact. And that's contributed a lot to our ability to get pretty steady realizations is we're not really underwater from a multiple perspective. And we've added a lot of value to these businesses, more value oriented businesses that we've grown in the last couple of years. So for instance, one of the key metrics that we track is what we call our distribution yield, which is the amount of realizations that we have as the numerator divided by our total net asset value. So really, it's the percentage of your overall funds that you're monetizing in any given year. And we have funds that invest over a four or five year period and may liquidate over another four or five years after that. So last year, our distribution yield, which is our realizations divided by our NAV, was north of 30% in North America. And so to have 30% or roughly one third that you're monetizing in a year is a really significant statistic and something that I think is significantly in excess of where the industry is today. Yeah, I was going to say it's a good number of both absolute and relative to the industry. Yeah. And I think it's due to the fact that we didn't go too long on the higher price tech related businesses. We thought about the right multiple to be paying in that really elevated cycle period. And I think we've been able to be quite good at adding some value. So you actually have real earnings growth coming through that cycle. The industry is going to have to work this out. But listen, we've seen it. We've heard a lot of forecasts of the end of the golden age of private equity. And there's always been some innovations that have helped go the other way. Yeah. And every 15 years, the same article comes out. Exactly. Right. It's the end of the golden age. So Bain Capital originated from the consulting firm, Bain & Company. And through my work with you and your partner, certain traits like operational excellence, value creation and technology, just to name a few, remain central to your identity. So how has that model evolved over the years? Sure. Well, it's- And so were you a Bain & Company person? Company person before you- I was. I was a Bain & Company person for a number of years. And I think that's similar to a lot of folks at Bain Capital. There's some part of their career where they spend, it could be Bain, it could be McKinsey or others. But yes, it's an important part of the DNA. It has helped us a lot with this value creation model, which is something we're really proud of. I think we were pioneers of it. But the reality is others have also said, hey, that's an interesting model. And they have value creation capabilities. So for us, it's really been about how do you continue to build the next and the next legs of it? One of the ways we've done it is just scale. So we have 130 people across our platform who are dedicated to value creation across our business units. And there's a lot of collaboration around knowledge and around capabilities and best practices that we're sharing. That's a really powerful aspect of what we're doing. We're trying to codify that and energize that even more. The second is building more specialist capabilities. So we have very deep teams in go-to-market strategy, in procurement strategy, in IT systems, and of course, in technology and AI, which is really the third big leg, which is there's an enormous opportunity to drive technology deployment into our companies. AI is a big one, but it's not just AI. It's data science. It's robotics. It's machine learning. Depending on the industry segment and the type of use case, there's a different technology. But our ability to, at the firm level, invest in being at the forefront, find use cases that we can actually field test in our companies, see what works, see what doesn't. And then to bring those to the other companies, this is a huge potential source of competitive advantage we have. And we can bring to this something unique, which is we're one of the few multi-asset class players that has or still has a venture capital business. And we love being in the venture business. We think it's a great standalone business to be in, but it contributes a lot to the rest of the platform, both in helping identify the newer disruptive technologies. So if you're investing in a late-stage buyout deal, you'll understand the winners and losers technologically. But we're at the forefront of investing in AI companies, in machine learning companies, data science companies that give us this view of what is working and what's not working that we think will help our platform. And that's the next big leg for us in value creation. So let's rewind the clock. Tell us about your career path. I asked you whether you were at Bain & Company. But how did you ultimately get into finance, private equity, and how did you initially come to focus on Asia? Right. So I think the Asia thing came first, depending on how far back you go. But let's just take after I graduated from undergraduate, a mentor said, hey, why don't you try going to Japan? And I had never been to Japan. But you were here in university in the United States. In the United States, yes. And I grew up in Ohio and upstate New York, so I've never been that far away. And I did it a little bit on a whim, and I got very interested in the culture. I mean, this was the late 80s, and this is when Japan was the big economic challenge to the United States. So I was also kind of fascinated as an economic student and the differences between these two systems. And that was a great experience and incredibly perspective enhancing and widening. And so I worked in Japan for a Japanese company in Tokyo for four years. Then I came back to the United States, went to business school, and that's when I joined Bain & Company. And I got into private equity and finance really from more of that angle of I loved what they did at Bain & Company, but this notion that Bain Capital had really pioneered, which was taking that analytical approach and applying it to investing in a driving value in companies, that seemed fascinating to me. So I think I got into the finance industry in a non-finance kind of way, and then it went on from there. It was only later that we then decided to open up the business in Japan. When I joined Bain Capital, it was pretty much a U.S. business. We were really just getting Europe going. So there was no Bain Capital Asia. I got involved in that a few years later. When did you actually start? 2005. Yeah. I remember that. I literally remember the meetings with your partners who were coming to talk to other financial institutions just to get their background. And you were all very helpful because, obviously, Goldman's incredibly long heritage and track record in Japan was not only very impressive and a great model for us to understand and really try to replicate in many ways, but you were a terrific partner as well. Yeah. I remember those discussions. So continuing on with your career, last year you were asked to become co-managing partner at Bain Capital. So can you talk a little bit about your new role and how you have adapted to it? So first of all, it's an honor and a privilege to have the opportunity to do this for the firm I love. I'm also thrilled to be partnering with my co-managing partner, John Connaughton, and our chairman, Jonathan Levine, who have been long-term mentors. And it's a team effort for us to think about how we take the firm to the next level. We are, at heart, a private partnership that is looking to drive the growth in value and develop the careers of our close to 2,000 people and 200 partners. And so a lot of what we're doing at the co-managing partner role is to try to ensure that this broad 12 business unit, business we've created, works really well together. It's driving these synergies at the platform level, at the intersection of business units, identifying some areas that we say, hey, this is a really great growth opportunity. It may involve two different businesses. How do we collaborate together to create something that's enhancing for the firm? Taking something that could be complexity and making sure that we're turning that into a real platform advantage. I see that as the overarching role. And it's not dissimilar from what I did in Asia. When we went to Asia, we went to Asia in a multi-asset class way. So we started with private equity, but pretty soon we had our direct lending business, special situations business. Now I mentioned life sciences. And we went to market as Bain Capital in a cross-platform way. And there's a lot of work to try to get all that to come together. And that's kind of where our Bain Capital and trying to leverage all these opportunities to make sure it's a creative growth and that we're creating new career opportunity lanes that were motivating and exciting the next generation of leaders, I'd say is the other really big part of this job. Yeah, Bain has a very special and unique culture. And I'd love to hear you talk about the culture you inherited at Bain and what it means to you and how you're going to carry that forward. So well, it's our greatest asset for sure. I mean, in many ways we admire and we've always revered the Goldman Sachs culture because for a lot of years, Goldman Sachs was a private partnership. It still obviously has that ethos. And culture is so critical. I mean, you talk to Goldman Sachs folks who've worked there, have been on to other things. And so many of the attributes of combining the incredible financial acumen with a collaborative approach and a focus on people, we try to really create that at Bain Capital. And I've inherited that. And the key though, is that as we grow and you become bigger and become more global, how do you ensure that doesn't dilute over time? And that has a lot to do with kind of growing, but keeping it small to making sure that we're operating at the vertical level and the country level, the business unit level in a way where people feel that they have mentorship and sponsorship of what they're doing, that we're still keeping that small entrepreneurial company feel while we're large and it requires a lot of communication and affiliation. So I think the core culture is very much there. The DNA is there, but there's a lot more you have to do every year to maintain that and even to enhance that. And part of the culture likely stems from the fact that you're still privately held and so many of your peers are no longer privately held. So why did the partnership choose to remain private? So we started in private equity world, we kind of looked just the same as pretty much all of our competitors. And now we're seeing this stratification in the industry along with all the growth. And I think where people have ended up depends a lot, I think, on their strategic choices. I mean, we definitely feel that the strategy should come first and then your corporate form would come second. And for us, the strategic choices are really critical. One, we want to have very strong alignment, both internally with our people, but also with our investors. And we have incredibly strong investors, our limited partners, that have been with us for many years. And we want to be 100% aligned with those investors. Second is we really want the freedom and the flexibility to choose the businesses that we want to be in based on how consistent they are with this approach we're taking of trying to generate premium performance in these alpha-oriented segments that we can do that with these deep capabilities. And we don't want that to be excessively driven by, okay, there's a high fee-related revenue component to it, which is trading at this. And so we need to shift our strategy in this direction versus that direction. We want to really determine what's the best mix of what's going to drive equity value. And third and maybe most important is we didn't want to sell the equity. We're a broadly held private partnership. There's really no one that a big owner who needed to monetize their stake. And we wanted to keep the equity for future generations. And we think that over the long run, that's going to be really critical to retaining the next generation of talent is that you do own all your equity. That can be something that folks aspire to over time as they're growing their careers and adding value. And so the corporate form there has a real impact on the talent retention in the core economic model. And we wanted to kind of control our destiny there. And the management succession has been very smooth from Mitt Romney, right, through the next generations and a great role model for your industry. Yes, for sure. So at the same time you took on the new role last summer, you had another new responsibility with a new baby in your family. So congratulations. Thank you. So how is that balance going? It's great in a word. I have six children in total. So I have a little bit of experience. That's a lot of experience. It's been great. I think the key success factor is just like I have a co-managing partner, I have an important co at home who does epic things to make it all work. So I know it's been a great, great, great experience. You're also personally a big supporter of music and music education. You've served on the board of the Berklee College of Music. Why is music important to you? Are you a musician? I play musical instruments, but I'm afraid to go on record here saying I'm a musician, especially the musicians at Berklee are way up there. But I love music is the short answer. It's an institution that does amazing things, both in terms of supporting music development and the arts and just the incredible high caliber. But it's also a great institution in terms of music as a vehicle to take folks who are not even in the education system into the education system and from there to really interesting careers. And they do a lot of innovative things. And it's a way to spend some interesting time on things that are not, you know, being capital in this industry. That's a lot of fun. So can't be happier. That's a great institution I'd encourage people to follow and look into. Yeah. I always say keeping your interests outside of work gives you longevity in this business. And so you have other things to think about other than. Yes. You need a bit of that. Right. So when you speak to younger people entering the financial industry today, what advice do you give them? We talked about the growth trends, and I think the really good side of the story is despite all the growth that's happened, we're still at the very early innings here in the growth of alternative assets. I mean, most of the metrics you look at private equity, penetration, credit, these new sources of, you know, the wealth channels and insurance are in like the five to 10% penetration zip code. So if this is a career you want to get into, it's a growth industry, which is always a positive thing. But listen, I tell folks the same thing I tell my kids, which is you got to follow your passion. You have to love it. You don't want to get into this industry because of growth or the economics and things like that. Those are actually the wrong. Second one's the wrong reason to do it. It's because you love it or you think you might love it, and it's dynamic, and, you know, we're in an era now where it's easier to change your career and to acquire new knowledge over time. And so you want to follow the passions and not feel too much pressure to do something that maybe is expected of you versus what you really want to do. So listen, a great industry to get into, but not for everyone. That's good advice. All right. So we like to end these sessions with a lightning round. So we're going to run through a couple of questions, just get a very quick answer. Sure. So what was your first investment? Very first investment was a company called U.S. Internetworking, which was kind of like a data center type business. Before your time. This was, yes. You know, the only interesting thing here was it was the first deal we did after 9-11, but it was, I think, 18 months when there were no deals done because we weren't sure what was happening to the world, but memorable in that way. And what would you say your greatest strength as an investor is? I would say it's working really hard to overcome your own biases, your own kind of confirmation bias, which is a very powerful force because it's something that, you know, has served you well in the past, but keeping an open mind as long as possible to new information that might change your view is really critical in this business because as much as we look at and think about patterns and history, each situation is different in very nuanced ways. And so not reacting based on too much based on your initial conceptions, I think, is really key to successful investing. So what's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Probably it was that person who said, why don't you go try to spend some time in Japan? I don't think I would have come upon it another way. It changed the trajectory of my life personally, but also, you know, in terms of the next advice, my mentor and former boss at Bankable, Paul Edgley, came to me and said, why don't you go start the Japan business, which at that time there was no business. So it didn't sound like a great idea, but I took his advice and I did that and that turned out to be a fun thing. And finally, what are you most excited about in the world right now? I know we're in a very tumultuous moment from a geopolitical point of view, but what excites you the most? Yeah, you know, listen, I think it's for sure what's happening in the world of technology and I'll broaden that to include, you know, biotech and life sciences. I mean, it's stunning, the pace of change and a lot of things that were talked about in like futuristic novels that even 5, 10 years ago, we kind of said, wow, I think that might happen, but I don't think I'll be alive for it. I think I actually, knock on wood, will be. Some of these- Flying cars. Some of these things are like around the corner. And we had a technology person come in and show us some, you know, visions of the most advanced robotics now and robots, and one of them was doing this like triple backflip and then went over and, you know, was cracking eggs. And you look to that and say, wow, that's really close to something that could dramatically change work, home, and all these things. And again, we talked a lot about AI, but in so many areas there's dramatic changes. It's a little scary, obviously, but it is pretty exciting. All right. Well, David, thank you so much for joining me today. This was a really fun discussion. Great. Thank you so much. It's been fun.

I'm Allison Nathan and I'm here with George Lee who is the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. Together we're co-hosting a series of episodes exploring the rise of AI and everything it could mean for companies, investors, and economies. George, good to see you again. Great to see you. I really enjoyed our first discussion and super excited about this one today. So today we are going to discuss how AI can fit into enterprises. We are always talking about the use case and perhaps we should say it's a big question about how enterprises can fit themselves around this evolving and exciting technology. So set the stage for us. When you think about what companies are doing today with AI, how would you explain the usage and how has that evolved over the last year or two? Yeah, great question. Well look, I think we're in the early days and that's consistent with the state of development of the technology itself, which is quite novel as you and I have discussed before. That having been said, there is definitely a value gap opening up between the trajectory of the technology and the amount of enterprise adoption of that technology. And I think there are really three reasons for that. First is, always was it thus. And by that I mean that the diffusion of new technology in businesses is always a little bit of a slow, deliberate process. Second, the pace of progress of the technology itself is an obstacle to adoption. Any technology that is moving as fast as this one makes it hard for CIOs, CDOs, etc. to figure out what technologies to deploy, when, where, and how. And so almost it's funny, as much as I admire their trajectory of improvement, for the sake of adoption I almost wish it would slow a little bit. Third, it's a general-purpose technology. That's part of the genius but that's part of the challenge for an enterprise. So its use cases are bounded only by human creativity and imagination, but it takes human creativity and imagination to determine how you want to use this very broad technology. Now I have two caveats to that. One is there's a generational component to this. In the department of it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks. As new people join our organization and organizations like ours, they inherently bring with them an appetite to use the technology, a facility with the technology, and they will in a way drive adoption naturally. So that will happen. The other thing I would say is there's a big distinction today between big incumbent companies who are using this technology or attempting to use this technology and de novo enterprises. If you're starting a business from scratch today and you can write code unfettered by legacy, etc., you can instantiate processes that are built from first principles around AI. It's an amazing piece of leverage. We have encoded workflows, habits, regulatory obligations, new technology, old technology, and fitting this new tool into that mosaic is just inherently harder. But man, if you look at the data from, I saw something from Y Combinator recently, new businesses being formed today that are using this technology to build the software platforms allow them to operate are just zooming. They're moving really fast. So look, early days, I'm very optimistic and be fascinating to talk to our guests about the actual practical day-to-day challenges of deploying this new technology. So let's bring Marco Argenti into this conversation. Marco is our Chief Information Officer here at Goldman Sachs. Thanks so much, Marco, for joining us. I'm happy to be here and this is definitely an exciting topic for us to discuss. Great. Welcome. Thank you. Marco, given the context that George just gave and the many developments in Gen AI over the last even weeks, certainly months, has your thinking about AI changed at all in this time period? I think the world of AI has changed like three or four times over even in the last year or so. And I think what's interesting is that every time we seem to have reached some form of a plateau, here comes sort of a bolt from the skies that, you know, just kind of makes us rethink any illusion of the technology having reached any sort of scaling limit. So if you look at even like the last two months, there has been some of the most fascinating evolution with regards to specifically thinking models and models that have the ability to reason. And if you look at those are not incremental changes. Also for the user standpoint, you now have models that, for example, can do real research for you in a depth that was unprecedented before. I personally tried it. I compared all these models on a topic that I know really well, which is kind of the last few years of the history of Nokia smartphones because I used to work there. And it's, you know, an interesting, like, obviously case study of, you know, strategic choices. And I had six different AIs doing the research. And some of that came out as the best book I've ever read on Nokia. It felt almost like it was written by an insider. And, you know, then we tried other subjects. So I think what I'm trying to say is, you know, I've been in technology, like, sadly for about, I would say, since I wrote my first line of code, now 45 years, almost exactly. And I've been through revolutions such, you know, the beginning of mobile or the internet or the beginning of the cloud or Amazon. This is compressed in a way that I've absolutely never seen before. So we all agree that the advances the technology itself is making is absolutely enormous and unprecedented in terms of the speed. But when you think about this topic of enterprise adoption, I mean, George already said it's not necessarily keeping pace, but what are you observing from your seat? In general, I agree with the fact that enterprises in general are lagging the state of the art with regards to adoption. Also because, I mean, let's face it, it took even, like, decades to be perfectly proficient with computers. And then it took, you know, years to be implementing the internet in a meaningful way. It took, you know, a couple of decades even for adopting the cloud. I would say we're, like, in year one and a half of actual useful products and not toys. So let's give ourselves a break a little bit, because guess what? On one side, you have a brain that is evolving on a daily basis. On the other side, you have a human brain that inhabits, that generally tends to evolve, you know, in hundreds of years or millennia biologically and at least years from a habit perspective. And so I think right now the biggest friction point to adoption of AI in the enterprise is people, is behaviors, is the fact that you have muscle groups that you need to retrain. Although, I have to say that we're starting to see areas where there is actually fairly consistent and meaningful progress. And those are, you know, in areas that maybe are a little bit easier to change because the people that work in there are more, in a way, open to change. And one of them, for example, is the developer community. The developer community, in many cases, tends to be eager to experiment new things. Historically, they know how to deal with imperfect products. A new operating system is released three, four, five versions to developers before it actually hits the market. And so you kind of know how to use stuff that is not there yet, and you kind of use the good stuff, and then you know how to deal with the bad stuff. And so I think that community has been very receptive, and that's one of, you know, the first area that Goldman has gained real traction of really improving our developer experience, and then as a result of that, getting more efficient. There are many other cases, but I will say that today, the real answer to your question is, this is probably one of the biggest change management challenges and exercises that any corporation have ever seen in their history. Totally agree. And Marco, one of the things I talk about with this technology is, especially as it relates to adoption, there is this magic button hypothesis. The idea that our users tend to expect it to work perfectly and solve all their problems, and unless and until it does, they tend not to want to adopt. Yeah. Again, caveat, as you write, certain populations more inclined to do it. How are we getting people on the journey with us, and how do we identify people who are willing to experiment, to change habits, to reconsider? Talk a little bit about what we're doing to foster adoption by finding those people inside the firm. You know, if you want to have a disruption or if you want to kind of be ready for a disruption, you need to find people that have already crossed the bridge of accepting that a disruption is going to take place and be very open to it. And so we have really started to seek for disruptors that have taken a very kind of, you know, purposeful approach on how to navigate through that disruption and ending up on the winner's side, even at the sacrifice of questioning their own beliefs or even sometimes really profoundly rethinking their own businesses. So we identified quite a few of those, and the trick when you're finding those disruptors is to find people that are actually in a position where they can drive change. And I think we have a few. You know, I don't want to, you know, call out names, but it's starting to become a movement, and those people in turn will influence others, will become role models, and then they will actually apply their judgment. So because we don't want reckless disruptors, we want mindful disruptors. And I feel pretty good about how we've been doing so far. Exactly. Now, I think the dynamic inside businesses, once you identify those disruptors, they're willing to take some risk. Think from first principles. They start to generate positive results. There's a follower effect in enterprises. And so that's what I think we're hoping to catalyze. Marco, you talked about one of the obvious use cases, which is instrumenting our developers with this technology. I can think of a few other sort of more pedestrian use cases. Let's dream big for a second. What are some of the most ambitious use cases of this technology for a knowledge-intensive business like Goldman? What are, you know, let's fast forward a couple of years. And what are some of the inspiring use cases you can imagine in a business like ours? I think my belief is we're heading towards a world where we're going to live in a hybrid workforce, where you're going to have to have the ability to manage interactions with human colleagues and AI colleagues with the same ease. And so in this hybrid workforce, one of the great advantages is the fact that you can achieve elasticity the same way as you do with the cloud. If 10 years ago someone would have asked the CIO of any large company how many servers you have, they would have said the number with very great precision. Today, if you ask me how many servers I have, I tell you I have no idea, because it might change on a minute-by-minute basis. Because with the cloud, if you have a high workload, especially in the world of serverless, you can go up and down in minutes. And I think that is actually going to be the same answer if you ask me 10 years from now, because you could actually surge agents for a closing of a quarter or for an earning season or for particular times in the market and then shrink and then go up and down on the agent side, where, you know, your human side kind of remains more stable. And talking about, you know, the way this is going to impact our daily life, I think one of the first objectives that we kind of already, I think, kind of realized is that pretty much every developer right now has AI in their what's called IDE, which is their interface to do coding, okay? I want that to happen to every single employee, but not for coding, but it should be basically as natural as Google, okay? It should be as natural as doing a web search. It should be actually, most importantly, as natural as sending an email to someone asking, can you do this for me, or can you find someone that could give me this information, like client report or research, et cetera. So going into really a world where you can ask natural language questions and you get very complex, very GS-specific answers. And for that, we built and we're deploying at scale our GS AI Assistant, which is really like your desktop for AI. That's the way to think about that. And from there is where you go to find answers. And I think to me, the evolution and what I see as a really fascinating future is where this assistant is actually becoming and sounding more and more like a very experienced GS employee or a very deep expert on a certain subject rather than giving you generic answers. Because at the end of the day, the companies that are going to win are the companies that are going to have a workforce that is not only embracing AI, but also, in a way, knowing how to make AI part of their daily life and their daily work. Marco, there are some guardrails that an institution like Goldman Sachs has to be aware of and put in place. So, I mean, talk to us about what we might be doing to try to overcome the limitations that we face in the type of information we deal with. We're using the latest models, but we're very careful at controlling, you know, any potential infiltration of external data or data externally. And most importantly, we are doing a lot of work to, you know, quote, unquote, ground those AIs so that they don't make stuff up. That is the most important thing. Right. So rather than removing stuff, we tend to actually make sure that stuff is actually accurate by cross-checking it with sources. So I think, you know, that's one of the things that, unfortunately, we live with when we talk about AI, that, you know, when you use AIs, you know, the wild type of AI that is out there, it's kind of a medical term, which means what's normally out there. You, in many cases, tend to get information that is not necessarily accurate, but it sounds really plausible. And then if you kind of try in a sort of a heavily grounded AI, it might sound a little bit less creative or imaginative, or maybe it's more correct. And so I think we've been putting a lot of our biggest effort there has been to increase accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and also to make sure that we minimize the risk of prompt injections or, you know, data somehow, you know, exfiltrating out or being inserted in the mix. This leads me to something you've written about, Marco, that I'm fascinated in, how the managerial challenge will evolve over time, where we're not only managing humans, but we're managing AI agents. How will that shift the job of being a manager? And what skills do we need to build to live in that world? Yeah, that's an incredibly, you know, fascinating question. So, first of all, one of the challenges is to somehow inject, call them the cultural traits, the leadership principles, the tenets, like I like to call them, of the organization into the AI agents the same way as you do with humans. Because cultures are very peculiar. Goldman is very peculiar. Amazon, where I was before, was very peculiar. And I tell you that people tend to kind of unify their decisions, their way of thinking around certain tenets, sometimes written, sometimes not written, and cultural traits, which, you know, you will get when you're here, and they're hard to describe, but you see them when you see them. Whereas agents that you implement from the outside are going to be like employees that we hire the first day. And so the challenge is agents will get smarter and smarter, but not culturally smarter, if you don't do something on that front. And I think this is not something that has been talked about too much. We talked about mostly like specialization of expertise. We're not talking too much about, in a way, enhancement of the cultural aspect of agents, because those agents eventually will, you know, even today we have, let's say, AIs or kind of agentic AI that does things like providing or creating drafts of research, or, for example, you know, in private wealth management, when it comes to portfolio analysis, to use agents to summarize the nature of business of dozens of positions, and in a way that puts a Goldman Lance into the answer. Okay? Even like something as simple as translation, which obviously should come out of the box, we have adapted the tool of Translate AI to translate in a way that is actually very specific to our financial content, but also that somehow is specific of the Goldman language, in a way, right? The way we call things, and imagine just acronyms, how complex that is. And so those are just early examples. But in general, I think as we use agents to more and more interact with people, but also produce content for people, I think there is a little bit of a sort of an extended example of the three laws of robotics for me, like Asimov. There are, you know, what are the actual leadership principles or tenets that an effective corporate agent should adhere to in order to fit into the culture of an organization? And I think that's a very complex problem that I don't think has been solved yet, to be honest. I mean, this hybrid workplace is just such a sea change from where we are today. I mean, do you see it really just driving corporate strategy overall? Yeah, there are companies, like I was on a panel actually yesterday with a chief people officer of a major software company, and her new title is chief people and AI officer. Because, you know, they're already thinking that even today, they want to look at how do we make sure that employees that communicate with our AI tools are not exposed to biases, for example. And also the cultural aspect of the answers is very important. And then agents are definitely something that is already knocking at the door. And so when you do like resources planning or when you actually like, you know, the training right now is such a big deal because we are all pretty much AI illiterate. This is comparable to a change on pre and post computers. And by the way, funny enough, if you talk to people like in the, I don't know, 40s and 50s or 60s about whether they could imagine a workplace without computers, a lot of people will tell you, absolutely. You know, the computer is always going to be this big thing over there that a few people with white lab coats are going to use. But on a day by day, there's nothing like a physical signature or a paper. You want to sit down and read it and whatever. And think about like today, imagine any company that doesn't have a computer. What would they do? They couldn't scale even like minimally. And I think in this new world, there is going to be actually an interesting, like you mentioned that, but a bit of a generation shift where you now have this new generation and my daughter is 20 and she knows how to use AI very naturally because she's been using it for, you know, at least two or three years. And a lot of the kids that are even coming into Goldman, they're extremely versed on AI. They're great prompt engineers and it took them years to perfect that. The same way as computers. And, you know, like I've seen that with, you know, with my parents or et cetera, that there was a point in time in history where if you actually never use the computer until you were like 40, you will be like never having ridden a bicycle until you were like 40 or 50 or never done certain things early enough that you will never be natural around it. You could use it. But even today, when I look around, I swear there's people that are still typing with one finger or two. Okay. And those are fine. They can be very effective. But there is definitely been a generational gap before on the use of computers and then on the use of the Internet. And now with AI, I think is even more profound. And so the change happening in a generation that is not AI first is the same as a generation that was not digital first. And that's why I think that's one of the biggest challenges for human resources and human capital professionals to try to understand how to navigate into this. And what makes it, I think, different is that all this is happening in weeks versus years. And that is what I think are raising some of the most profound questions on how to actually drive that change or how to actually somehow survive that change. So how long will it take until we get to a hybrid workforce? I think for developers is already kind of happening because there are today virtual developers that you can buy for $20 to $30 a month, literally, and you can chat with and they do things for you. You're always going to need a developer because I don't believe in a future that is dominated by AIs and humans of a marginal. I mean, I tell you that is not even in sight, not even for the most futuristic predictors. In fact, AI, I think, makes the role of humans even more important because you now have an added responsibility. Everybody becomes a manager. Everybody becomes a manager of agents. They can have hundreds if they want. And everybody needs to be somehow taking responsibility for the work that is done. And the amplification of your good and your bad can be incredible. Your mistakes can be amplified and your successes can be amplified. And so you even have more responsibility. Therefore, this is a wake-up call to step up for everyone. And I think the centrality of professionalism and high judgment has never been more important than now. Speaking of being an AI native, you and I both push ourselves to be ardent adopters of the technology. But you have a very specific personal use case that I admire and I've seen a lot of cool evidence of. Why don't you talk about some of the ways that you use AI and the one in particular you know I'm thinking about? So I do in my spare time, which is not much, but I'm a little bit of an amateur musician. And so I've composed a few songs with AI that actually some of them my band has actually performed live. And I have to say that, OK, AIs can do terrible compositions. But actually, if used properly, they really accelerate or make it, you know, make it much easier to kind of go through the creative process. If you try to kind of help it for some of the mechanical part of composing a song or like, you know, creating rhythms or loops. So there is a lot of musicians that are actually using it creatively. And I'm not obviously one of them, but I aspire to be at least OK on that. And so I've been doing that with pretty good results. And all it takes is just knowing how to ask. First of all, Marco's being humble. He's a terrific musician. And I must say the music that he co-composes is remarkable. The lyrics are poignant. The rhythms are interesting. And so it's one of those things that you see that really makes you sit up and take notice of the progress of the technology and the ways that human creativity can be used, can be elevated with it. So, Marco, thank you so much for being with us. Fascinating discussion. We could go for hours. Thank you, Allison. Yes, absolutely. I mean, we started this conversation saying adoption. We got to give ourselves a break. We're only a year and a half into this. So I'm really interested to see how this all evolves. Thank you so much, Marco. Thank you so much. Thank you. And thanks to you, George. Great. That was fun. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Thursday, March 6th. I'm Allison Nathan. Thanks for listening.

I'm Alison Mass, Chairman of Investment Banking in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking and Markets Business and your host for today's episode. Today I have the great pleasure of sitting down with Don Mullen. Don is the founder and CEO of Predium, a real estate-focused investment firm with about $57 billion in assets under management. Before that, he spent about a decade here at Goldman Sachs, where he served as head of our Securities Division's Global Credit and Mortgage Business. Don and I have known each other for almost 40 years, and I'm excited to... You look much better than I do over those 40 years. Thank you. I will accept that compliment. Don and I have known each other for almost 40 years, and I'm excited to hear Don's views on the housing market, and in particular, his predictions about the future of real estate as an asset class. So Don, thanks so much for being here. Thank you for having me. Nice to be included in a great investor's group. That's very kind of you. Well, you're one of the greatest. Greatest. Very kind. So let's start in 2012, when you left Goldman Sachs to create Predium. What did you see at the time that made you want to take that risk? Sure. I saw a couple of things. I'd say that in those 40 years that we just referenced, I had the opportunity to see the savings and loan crisis, the tequila crisis, LTCM, long-term capital management, for those of you old enough to know, and the dot-com. And so each of those crises really ended up reshaping the market's regulatory environment and capitalism a bit itself. And so when the global financial crisis happened, my view about that was that we were going to change the manner in which we lent money for mortgages, that we would be in a position that we had to move 10 million Americans out of home ownership into rentership, and that the assets themselves were trading at a material discount. I also had a view, quite frankly, that my time at Goldman Sachs was over. Not because anybody asked me to go, because I was old enough that it was time to, quite candidly, either try to be in higher management at the firm, which I am politically completely incapable of executing. Not true. And as a result, thought it best that I move on to something that I might add more value than here. So with that, I often viewed myself as the least successful member of my cohort of people. So we were talking about partner cohorts. My cohort includes successful fellows like Dave Tepper and Mark Rowan and Tony Ressler. And I could go on and on of people that we both work with. I said, they did it as entrepreneurs much more than working here. So each of them, I think, benefited from either a great idea or a great market entry point. And I saw this as a generational event. And despite my years in corporate credit and a small amount of time in mortgages, I thought the investment moment was all about single family homes and mortgages. And it would be an investment event, one of the greatest ones of my lifetime. Well, it was certainly a great idea and perfect timing. And it sounds like Pretium was formed in the shadow of the financial crisis, as you mentioned. So how has the housing market changed since then? Sure. Dave, as a country, made the decision that we wanted to substantially reduce systemic risk in the system. So the first thing we did was we created the qualified mortgages, which has reduced the risk in underwriting and increased the speed, quite frankly, that you could underwrite a safe mortgage. And with that, we defined a box pretty narrowly, knowing full well that we would increase the number of people who are renters versus that. Active homeownership volatility is modest in the United States. If we go back to the 1960s, I think we varied between 62% homeownership and 69% over the course of that almost 64 years. So while the changes that we were making were significant in reducing systemic risk, we weren't changing the American dream in a way that it wasn't attainable for the majority of Americans. So I think one of the most important parts of the housing crisis was the manner in which we rationalized the industry. So we reduced home construction dramatically in the face of an oncoming tsunami of demographics. If you looked at the history, even at that time, you could tell that millennials were aging, that we were going to be in a position within a decade, we were going to be short a substantial number of houses. That shortage is expected to last at least 2040. So we have years to go, and we have a massive demographic imbalance between housing volume and prospective homeowners and home renters. And so as you can tell, we're building homes as fast as we possibly can today, but that's still not going to meet the needs of the American people today. So we should expect a persistent and continued shortage of homes. So with that as a backdrop, how is Predium capitalized on those opportunities you're talking about? Sure. So we're the largest private owner operator of single family homes in the country today. We are also the fourth largest manager of residential assets, both homes and apartment buildings in the United States today. We're one of the largest lenders to people who renovate homes, investors who do what's called a fix and flip. So we're one of the largest lenders in that space. We're also a top non-QM lender. What's non-QM for those listeners? Non-qualified mortgages are people who don't fit in that box that I described earlier. So ironically, those are people like Ben Bernanke. The non-qualified mortgage means that you don't get a W-2, so you're not a regular employee. So if you're a speakers bureau person like Ben Bernanke, or an artist, or a consultant, or a person who owns a small business, a chain of dry cleaners, or drugstores, or gas stations, you are a non-QM mortgage. So many Americans. And those have to be bespoke underwritten. So I have a business that does that too. It's been a terrific business, and we're really very happy how many folks we've been able to lend until they can buy houses. And we are also in the business of buying stressed and distressed mortgages for people who need to have help working them out so they can become re-performers. So we have an ecosystem that touches almost every part of housing in the United States. So you've talked about your unique investment approach, as the company's both an asset manager and an operator of those underlying assets. So does that give you certain advantages? Sure. I think being in a position, it's a higher level of complexity. So if you think about what we really like, it's high complexity. And so whether it's serving single family homes, meaning owning, operating, leasing, repairing, we do all that. We do the same thing in multifamily. We originate mortgages, as I said, and we work on stressed and distressed mortgages and make those loans for fix and flip. Let me give you a sense of why it's important to own the operating company. The average unit size of what we're talking about is $300,000 to $400,000. That's a lot of units when you're managing almost 60 billion of them. So that's a lot of units. And so as a result of that, you're in a position that you need an operating company that you can control its focus, make sure it makes the right investments in technology, optimize workflow to deliver efficiency on behalf of your investors. And so one of the unique things about the firm relative to what investing was like 20 years ago is we take highly fragmented asset classes and are able to roll them up into investable scale global institutions. And that's relatively unique, and that's why we have such a large cohort of operating companies to do it. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit more about investing in single-family housing. How far have we come in terms of making this asset class investable, and how much more progress do you think can be made? Sure. So we as an industry still are in a position that the single-family rental business managed by institutions operate about, let's call it, 3% to 4% of the industry. Single-family is an industry that's had institutional investors since the early 1990s, increasingly dominant in that space. That was one of the moments we talked about, the savings and loan crisis. That industry moved into institutions and away from individuals. So there's tremendous upside growth for investors in this space. I strongly believe it benefits the residents in these assets because we're able to provide more services at the same cost as renting from an individual. In addition to that, we've been able to have houses in, I would call it, better communities, meaning our houses are predominantly in good school districts with low crime rates. And the goal behind that is that helps folks who are renters get into better communities and helps in many cases break intergenerational poverty. It's important to understand that if you look at the Harvard Housing Study on home ownership versus rentership, they point out that the most important thing to break intergenerational poverty is, yes, owning a house, but the second best thing is renting a house in an ownership community. In a good school district. That's what ownership communities are rented by. So not being in a rental-only community. And so while it's a challenge for many public policy people who are less understanding of this topic to think that a house might have been owned by someone, the family living in it feels it's a blessing. And so with so many Americans, remember, of all the homes in America, almost a third are rented and 41% are renting. And of those people who are renting, 70% of them would prefer to live in a house than an apartment building, but can't. And one of the reasons why single-family rental is actually declining as a choice. The only asset class over the last five years that's seen it decline in square footage is single-family rentals. Not because of this. Why is that? Because the moms and pops went through COVID and couldn't sustain the challenges of managing through that problem. And so they've been big sellers of assets. The industry shrank, not from the institutions, but from the individuals. So is it an institutional investable asset class? Yes. It's from Australia to Abu Dhabi. Is the liquidity of the asset getting better? It's yes. But real estate generally, as we know right now, is sticky as interest rates went up pretty dramatically. And that's created a dislocation in many forms of real estate, except for everything, maybe not data centers. And so what we see right now is that we think that we're in a position that we get a more understandable rate on interest. But I think right people don't understand right now where interest rates are going because we have the challenge of public policy around tariffs and immigration. As soon as we have a better understanding where rates will go, I think you'll see real estate start to trade more aggressively. But yes, this asset class is institutional and it's happening right now. Well, we talked about this a little bit earlier, but when you think about the future of housing in America, will owning a home be as important as it's been historically? Or do you think long-term renting is going to become more common? Well, if you travel the world, so we can look at data from around the world, and some of the highest home ownership rates in Europe are in Greece and Italy, ironically. I don't think that'd be on anybody's list. And some of the lowest are in Germany and Denmark and some of the other countries that are viewed as historically engines of growth in Europe. The United States, I don't think, should be as concerned if rentership grows because it improves labor mobility, which is an important thing that's an important part of GDP growth is being in a position that the workforce can move around. And certainly the most recent increase in interest rates from a very low number to a more normalized number has slowed labor mobility. But I'd also say there's alternative ways for people to save. And the tax advantages of owning a home have not been as attractive because the standard deduction versus the itemized deduction, not to geek out, but then last but not least, as I showed you a chart earlier, it's actually cheaper to rent a house than to own a house right now. And so there are different periods of time that I think it makes more sense to rent versus own. This is one of those moments. I think that a lot of people would have been better off during certain periods if they had rented a house and invested in the stock market. So I'm not going to take one side or the other of that story. I think we should leave people the opportunity to make those choices. Again, someone with a 620 FICO score, where there's a lot of Americans, with $40,000 to $60,000 of debt, be that student debt or auto debt, they cannot buy a house in this country. They need to be able to rent a house. And so unless we're going to be in a position to say those folks don't have the right to live in a house, we need an industry that rents them houses. By the way, you and I grew up in our business lifetimes, mostly in a zero interest rate environment. We were very fortunate. A lot of our career was in a zero interest rate environment, which is interesting. I want to talk a little bit about how interest rates impact your business. And I imagine that there are a range of implications, perhaps some positive and some negative. And you've built this business through highs and lows, now, as you say, more normalized. So talk a little bit about that. Sure. I lived through a pretty unconventional period. When I first started raising money and I was talking to investors, and the most common question was, well, if we have such a large imbalance of demand versus available supply of houses, and so many people with lower FICO scores, what could go wrong? My answer was, having worked here at Goldman Sachs, and not on my resume, is I helped run the life insurance company that we had at the time. And we used to have a thing called the Spanish flu stress test. What is that? That was when the Spanish flu hit, and how many policies would you have to pay out versus your liquidity and assets when you had a large cohort of people become sick and dying. So I would say to people during the period that I was raising money, something like a pandemic would be very bad for house prices. So I bring that up as a self-deprecating comment, because clearly I was wildly wrong. A pandemic drove up house prices rather dramatically, and let me bring that to what that means with interest rates. Because if you had asked people what was going to happen when rates went up, people would have said to you that house prices would sag. But because we went so quickly up in interest rates off such a low level, what we did was we destroyed not the demand function as much as we destroyed the supply function. So while home builders are building at pretty rapid rates, we have a 70% to 80% decline of homeowners selling their home and moving on. So the net available of supply of houses available are down. Demand is down less than supply is down. So higher interest rates actually caused some increase in home prices. Very unexpected by the Fed and everyone overall. Just like a pandemic caused an increase in prices and no one expected that. All right. So I want to pivot to talk about your path into finance, understanding whether you saw yourself having this type of career. And then I want to go back to your time at Drexel, Burnham, Larimer, where we actually worked together and first met. Well, so I grew up in New Jersey and my dad was an elevator repairman, and I didn't really know what job I was going to have. So my mom likes to tell the story and I've recovered from the trauma of my mom telling this story that the first job I had wanted was to be a detective because I read a book called Encyclopedia Brown. Yeah. I love that book. When I was a kid. It's a great book. And I actually, I was the only kid instead of a lemonade stand, I had a detective agency out on the street. I love that. That is a great story. My mom loves to tell that story and I've gotten over the embarrassment. By the way, it's not too late for a career. Exactly. Magnum PI version, right? I can get a nice car too. But with that, so I never thought of finance. Nobody in my house read the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. My dad didn't go to college and then my mom, they got married when they were 20 and 19. And my dad was in the military and then became, as I said, an elevator repairman. My dad's only rule growing up is that you have to go to college. It's a good rule. Because he was the only one in his family, his brother and sister one. So with that, I had a ironic twist in life, which people find hard to believe. And our old friend Harvey Schwartz makes fun of me when I say it, which is, I think I'm the only person ever in the history of the university system in the United States who was rejected at Rutgers and accepted at Yale. That is funny. I think I'm the only person. That is really funny. I think the odds are pretty much. I'm probably the only person. Probably. Right. That's hilarious, actually. Yes. So with that. Rutgers loss, by the way. And so I ended up having a new perspective. And I started as an English major in college, and then I realized how little money English professors make and the odds of me actually becoming a great writer was low. And so then I made the transition into economics and got a summer job, and I still had absolutely no idea what Wall Street was. Was a summer job at Drexel Burnham? No, my summer job was at First Boston. And that was pre-Excel spreadsheets for those of you who don't know what that was like. So it was green accounting paper that you had a handwriting. And I made spreadsheets with a big piece of, we used to call it oak tag, you know, those big poster boards with a pencil and white out. And then I would photograph them, you know, like in the big printers to make spreadsheets for our research reports that we sent out. I'm sure our listeners do not know what white out is, but that was a classic of the 80s. It was. That was. So, yes. So I didn't know what I was doing when I was hired in the fixed income research. And I thought that meant I was investigating or analyzing Social Security payments. And little did I know it was the bond market. So talking about Drexel Burnham, what did you take away from that time in your career? And what have you learned about building an organization? Sure. Well, that's a podcast all by itself. So from Drexel Burnham, I'd say the most important thing I learned was cash flow. Liquidity. Not just the liquidity for the company you work at itself, which was important, right? But the world, having spent time doing corporate analysis before I went there, you know, my background was research for, let's call it six, seven years before I got into the high yield marketplace. Credit research? Yep. I was a credit research analyst. Any particular industry or just? I first started out in the electric utility industry, which sounds really tedious. I was just going to say, fascinating. Except it was the period we were building nuclear power plants. The industry almost went completely bankrupt. And the reason was because of a thing called AFUDC, which I won't give you what the acronym means, but I'll tell you what it is. Okay. Capitalized interest. And so what it was is that people who were doing the research, because the industry of quality fixed income research was so new, didn't know to subtract, actually didn't know to add back AFUDC. They just subtracted it. And so they saw interest coverage ratios and debt service capability far in excess of the company's true ability to service. And so several utility companies went bankrupt and it was the beginning of distressed investing after Penn Central. So with that, I became very focused on learning about real accounting, not just reported gap. And so as a result, became a better bond trader, bond salesman, because I actually understood the financial statements and I understood cashflow. And that's why Drexel hired me. And everybody there was about cashflow. So I want to go back to the second part of my question, which is, what have you learned about building an organization, having founded Predium and you built it to where it is today? Sure. I have the incredible benefit. So over those 40 years we just talked about, I did a pretty good tour of Wall Street and I worked at First Boston, as we said. I worked at Drexel. I worked at Salomon Brothers. I worked at Bear Stearns. I worked at Goldman Sachs. So you get to spend a long time places and it doesn't mean that I skipped around. It just means I'm old. And so with that, each organization really gave you the opportunity to get a perspective both on the different cultures, as well as thoughts on risk management, how important people are to a successful organization. And I think most importantly, the work ethic that it takes for an organization to succeed. So at most of the organizations, I would say the successful ones in particular, incredible work ethic, optimism is critically important. Pessimism is an important thing to be aware of. It's a tool to use in risk management, but it can't be a dominant factor in the culture. Bear Stearns had a little excess pessimism in the way they approach things and therefore didn't take enough risks to succeed. And we can have another podcast that talks about why they did fail. It wasn't about their risk taking on their trading desk as much as people think. Goldman Sachs was filled with optimism and confidence. Still is. Yeah. And I think it's a critical part of its culture. And I think that you need to be optimistic, again, hardworking, high quality people who want the organization to succeed is critical, a bonding of people to try to accomplish that. And growth is critical because when people feel like they're on a shared mission to grow something, they take great pleasure out of it. But working really hard to go sideways grinds people down. It's not a lot of fun. So hopefully that was helpful. Very much so. And I'm sure you can spend another hour talking about what you've learned about building organizations. So before you joined Goldman Sachs in 2001, which by the way, the same year I joined, you actually discussed work-life balance with Lloyd Blankfein, our CEO at the time. So tell us that story. Right. So I won't say that I have the view of work-life balance the way it's discussed currently. I had recently gotten divorced and had the wonderful benefit of joint custody. And so I had my daughters every other week for the full week. And it doesn't matter of all the things I've had the great opportunity to do, which is, you know, eat at the White House with a bunch of presidents or be on the board of a bunch of companies or have great colleagues during financial crises where we made money when other people lost money. I can go through the list of bands I've seen, concerts I've been to. It doesn't matter. The most joyful moments are being with your children and having them have joy in accomplishing or doing something. So when Lloyd was trying to hire me, I said, I have just one rule. And he said, what? I said, every other week, I am home for dinner. Every single night. Every night. And that doesn't matter. And how did he react to that? He looked at me like I was a Martian at first. And in only the way he can, he thought of a way to commercialize it and decided to make me a figurehead of work-life balance, which no other person on earth would ever have thought of me as a work-life balance person. Because on the other weeks, I worked. Right. 24-7. And he still would call me on vacation with my daughters and ask me, what the hell just happened on something? But it's important because the opportunity to spend time with your children and watch them grow is one of the best experiences any person can have. And so I think we should all try to find the opportunity for people to have that. So I just, I'm going to go off script for a minute. You mentioned that your mom had one rule that you had to go to college. My dad. My dad. Okay. Had a rule. My mom, a God lover, used to say it was too stressful for me. I shouldn't go. All right. So your dad had this rule that you had to go to college. Do you have rules for your children? And what are they? Sure. And they didn't listen to me. So the first thing I said was, please, can we not get tattoos before college? That's a good rule. But it didn't work? Didn't work? And I said, listen, because in college, I have no control anymore anyhow. So that didn't work. They just hid them until they were in college. So yeah. And then I had pretty rigid times you had to come home. Did that work? That did work though, because I had more control over that. I'd be standing at the door and they all complained. But I used to say, when you're 16 years old, there's nothing good happening after 11 o'clock and 17 could be midnight and maybe senior year, you got to 1am on Saturday nights, but that was about it. So yes, we had good rules, but there were also, you know, academic rules that there were no TV during the week. There was, you know, that was completely defeated by social media on your laptop, though. But yeah, I had extensive rules and I was known as the strict dad among their group of peers. Okay. By the way, my husband always says and said to our kids in high school, nothing good happens after midnight. Yes. That was his rule. So. And they'll still think it's true. Yeah. No, absolutely. So let's continue on with your life outside of work. You're also a passionate art enthusiast. In fact, I'm not sure how widely known this is, but you were instrumental in bringing art to the High Line, which for those of you not in New York, is an elevated freight rail line that's been transformed into a public park. So talk about that experience and why art has played such an important role in your life. Sure. I took my first art history class in senior year of college, and I was completely overwhelmed by just the experience. That once I started making a little bit of money and being in a position I had a little bit of free time, I spent a lot of time at museums and starting then to think you could actually collect things, which just never occurred to me, I don't know why. And I began a contemporary art collection, and it was at around that time that the other Goldman Sachs partners were getting very involved in the High Line. So lots of folks here were big in helping the founders help create the park, and that group of folks asked me if I would like to get involved. So I met Robbie and Josh, who were the founders, the real catalysts behind it, and they asked me to sponsor the garbage collection program. The garbage collection program? Oh yeah. So this was really both a true story and somewhat unfortunate, but all the guys from Goldman had gotten the opportunity to sponsor these beautiful ends of the park, this sitting area, these trees, this cafe. And you got the garbage collection. And I was getting the garbage collection, which I really did feel was typical of my role on management committee and FIC, that I could put my name on the garbage cans. Yeah, there was not going to be a banker who was collecting the garbage. Definitely a FIC. So I said, not sure I really want to do that, but I said, Robbie and Josh, what do you guys think about your art program? What's your program going to be? And they said, we don't have an art program and we will not have an art program. I said, that's not possible. You're running one of the great public parks in the world. You're renovating an extraordinary early 20th century piece of infrastructure and making it into one of the most accessible, unique pieces of city architecture and park in the world. And all the galleries are on either side of it. You have to have an art program. And they said, no, we're not going to have an art program. And I said, just tell me why you're not going to have an art program, not to make this long window. They go, we can't afford it. We have so much money that we have to raise for the park itself that we can't afford any mission outside the park itself. I said, that makes perfect sense. I understand that. Well, if you change your mind, call me back. They called me about a year later in classic, like a sitcom. They said, we have good news and we have bad news. I said, okay, what is it? The good news is we're going to do an art program. And I said, that's terrific. What's the bad news? There can't be any bad news. You're going to pay for it. You're going to sponsor the whole thing. I said, well, that's not a problem. I'll talk to my friends at Goldman. No, you have to pay for 100% of every piece of art that we do on the High Line for at least the next five years. Wow. It's a big commitment. And I was like, oh, okay. When we think about that, yeah, I'll do that. And it's been one of the, like I said, your kids are the most important thing to you. Being in a position to be involved with the High Line and art program is something that I've been very lucky that they made that decision. And I'm very thankful that they gave me the opportunity to be involved and the money is irrelevant. It was wonderful. It's still wonderful. And it's extraordinary. I mean, New York is one of the greatest cities in the world, objectively speaking, of course. And I think the High Line is number one or two thing you're supposed to see when you're in New York. Yes, yes. In terms of tourist attractions. Yeah, I think it's a top two or three visited site. Now, it wasn't designed for that, which is why it's so crowded. The original surveys when it was designed thought they would have almost one-tenth the tourist visits that it does. That's amazing. And it's become catalytic around the world where other people come to study it to see what they can do with their old infrastructure and cities and not just tear it down, but renovate it in a way that brings more life to those communities. I think it's already accomplished a lot of that. So before we move to the lightning round, which I'd like to do, I want to end with a question on how you see Predium evolving. You were early in finding a new way to invest in real estate. So what are some potential new investment categories that we could see? Sure. So I mentioned in passing what we do in residential credit more broadly and real estate. And so we lend money to, I mentioned, fix and flip folks who renovate houses and make them for consumers to buy. And so that's a way we need to renovate housing stock in America. We have the oldest age of housing stock in American history now. And so we have a massive renovation need as a country to be in a position that folks can purchase houses that were not really of contemporary nature. I won't go down the rabbit hole, but I will say that in changing the mortgage system that we did in 2008, we changed it so it's harder for a consumer to do that themselves. And so as a result, we need this intermediary of investor to renovate houses. So what you'll see us do is continue to grow by helping facilitate renovation and building houses. We're fast growing in to be one of the largest lenders to home builders in the United States. You're going to see that occur because banks are exiting that field. So like they've exited a lot of other businesses and created the growth of private credit, they're exiting lending to home builders. They're exiting lending to land development. They're exiting lending to lot finance. They're exiting lending to multifamily construction. And we and others are taking over that. So you should see us be very large in that space over the coming years. We continue to see opportunities in what we call residential credit, which is our stressed, distressed MSRs, all the mortgage universe of assets. It's a pretty resilient all weather strategy that we continue to grow. And we're very excited about the opportunities in the coming years. And we think right now is, in fact, one of the best times to invest in that category. You also will see us become international, but deliberately did not choose the word global, but international because the problems that the United States faces are not unique. Longevity is something that's happening worldwide. So people are staying in their houses longer. Immigration is something that most countries need at some dose of. We can all debate what's the right amount. But because birth rates have been flat to down, we need immigration. So the UK's short houses, Canada's short houses, Australia's way short houses, the banking system's not up to the task of lending in all these places. So there's need for the same banking products and renovation products that we've talked about. So I would expect our firm to be international as we think of the coming years with the same set of products, multifamily, single family, home builder, lending and mortgages. And that I think you'll also continue to see us look for adjacencies so that we can continue to be in a position that people look at as the go-to firm in residential assets, internationally and domestically. All right. So we like to end these sessions with a lightning round. So we're going to run through a couple of questions and just get a quick answer. That's hard for me, but I'll do my best. Okay. What was your first investment? I always think my first investment was my studio apartment at 77 Bleecker Street as that. How did that investment do, by the way? Well, but I would say that my first financial investment, separate from a house, was buying long bonds when interest rates were at 14% on their year. Do you remember, I think when I started, I think the prime rate was 20 in the early 80s? For sure. A crazy time. All right. You talked about music a couple of times and concerts. Who's your favorite musician? Well, I have lots of favorite musicians at the current moment. I will say that my daughters like to make fun of me because I'm a big Chaperone fan and the Charlie XCX. I'm not even sure I know how to say that right, but I love those are my two current favorites. And then I have a new wave group of favorites. I'm a Blondie fan and the Psychedelic Furs and the Talking Heads. And then obviously some of the best concerts I've ever been to are Rolling Stones concerts who I've been to well over 20. I had the pleasure at a Rolling Stones concert. That must be their third or fourth retirement tour. And I was at the Prudential Center and I was with my daughter, my middle daughter, who's a huge Stones fan. And we're sitting there and there's this blonde woman sitting next to us all by herself. She was very charming and chatting with everyone and then the Stones had Bruce Springsteen come out. Wow. It was great. And then he went back and they said, our next guest is Lady Gaga. And so my daughter and I looked up and looked left and the seat was empty. No way. And so she performed and then she came back and said, she goes like, how'd that go? Oh my gosh. And so we were like, I cannot believe we were sitting with Lady Gaga and we're both Gaga fans. So. That's great. My new favorite is Shaboosie, which my daughter teases me about, who I think is fantastic. All right. Back to our business lightning round. So what do you think your greatest strength is as an investor? I've had guys call it like pattern recognition, right? Which is what a lot of folks do in this space is I've never had what I would call short to intermediate term pattern recognition skills. So there's a lot of great stock investors. That's one of the things that they can do. I'm more of a pattern recognition long arc, as we've talked about, like it was so obvious to me in 2008 that we would change the shape of the mortgage market and that if you were early capital into it, you could be in a position to forge a business out of that. And so I constantly look for that and I think that's, you know, the value. It doesn't mean I'm always first, but I try once we make a decision to go into it, we become very successful at it. And so I think it's that understanding when businesses are dislocated in many ways. What I would characterize, which you said earlier, what did I learn from these other firms? It was less about investing and more how to build a business that invests. So it's not like some folks who would wake up in the morning very successfully like Dave Tepper and look at a stock and he understands where it's going to go. I'm not that person. But I can look at trends and fundamental trends, regulatory trends, GDP trends, and things like that, and have a sense of where we're going to go and then try to manufacture an enterprise that will capture the opportunity from those changes. Yeah. Well, as you said, pattern recognition. Yeah. So what's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Well, I'll give credit. I had a colleague here named Pablo Salame. And like all partners at Goldman Sachs, in fact, we were all competing. We were competing with each other every minute. And so we were very parsimonious with our compliments to each other. But we had some rough times, and Pablo was very kind to say, don't doubt your confidence in your ability for pattern recognition. It's very extraordinary. So that was an insight and a compliment that at times you needed, so I give Pablo credit for that. Advice I'd say more from my dad, who more or less said, you have no control over where you're born, who you're born to, whether you have hair or don't have hair, whether you're charming, you're handsome or not, but you do have control over how hard you work. And so you may not be a key, you might not be able to outsmart someone, but you can outwork them. That's good advice. So that's been one of the most important things someone told me. So you've talked about David Tepper and some others, but which investor do you admire most? Well, I think there's lots of people that I look at them and I admire them for things they've created. So he's an extraordinary investor, right, Dave Tepper. I would say that Mark Rowan's an extraordinary business builder, is really an extraordinary business builder. And so I look at people for different skills and what they've accomplished in doing those things in the space that I know the best. And so Mark's pretty high up there on all skies. I think that, you know, I'd say that having been here, I give a lot of credit to both Lloyd and David. This is a not fun place to run and I know everybody thinks it's a fun place. Maybe it's not fun every day, but it's probably fun. I will tell you my happiest day is when I realized I would never run this place and I thought I was going to be sad and I was relieved. I think it's really hard and I think they earned every nickel they get. It's a really hard job. So I admire them for their contributions and the hard work they put into to deal with it. But I would go back like one of the best investors I ever saw was Tepper and one of the best business builders is Rowan. So where do you spend your time outside of the office now? Well, I still spend time on art. I still spend time looking for pattern recognition more in books as I get older rather than the Wall Street Journal because things like the Wall Street Journal and research, I always feel like I'm reading something that everyone knows already. It's not new. Right. What books do you read? I'm reading books on AI now because I'm trying to understand what's really going to happen because we don't need large language models to change the world. It wasn't too many years ago we called this machine learning, I think correctly. And so I already see the beginnings of its impact on what I do and not just in investing, but you're going to see it even in a computer does a better job handling resident inquiries for challenges with the house than a human being does. So I think we'll see a lot of that. And one of the reasons I'm optimistic despite these volatile times, both socially and politically and economically, is I think we will end up with an era of unprecedented labor productivity coming up. So similar to the 90s, though, even more extreme. And I think that will allow us to improve GDP per person so significantly that I'm less worried about our high level of federal debt, quite frankly. So I spend time on things like that. I know that's weird. I like doing that as a thing to do. I still like collecting art. I have a five-year-old. So I have the blessings of a 32, 31 and a 30 and a five-year-old, and that is one of the greatest gifts I could have ever received. So I'm going to watch him do ice hockey because he's a big ice hockey fan is extraordinarily fun. It'll be fun. And I like working. Right. So, yes, I do things that work. Of all the things you said that you asked, let me tell you one that you didn't ask. Would I have ever imagined that at 66 years old, I would still love working 60 hours a week doing what I'm doing? And I never would have imagined it. I'm the guy whose dream was that at 45, I would buy a bar in St. Bart's and live there year-round. Instead, here I am, 66, still working. But you're having more fun than you've ever had in your life. That's great. So, Don, thank you so much for being here.

Corporate bond spreads that reflect the additional yield on corporate bonds above government bond yields have risen dramatically in the past month. So what should we make of that? Does it mean that bond investors are hunkering down for a recession? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by Lotfi Karoui, our chief credit strategist and the head of credit, mortgages, and structured products research. Lotfi, welcome back to the program. Thank you for having me. So Lotfi, first catch us up. There's a lot going on. Give us some sense of what's been happening in the corporate bond markets in recent weeks. Yeah, so there is this general perception among many people that corporate credit has sort of been resilient and it's outperformed its beta relationship to the equity market. That's actually just optical illusion. If you look at how much spread widening we've had since the peak of the market in mid-February, it's been exactly equivalent to what you should expect with an S&P that is down roughly eight to eight and a half percent. And so I think what's creating a little bit of confusion is really that the starting level is so tight and optically it looks like investment grade spreads are still below 100 basis points, which is true. I mean, that is tight when you put it in historical context, but the change or the additional risk premium that has been building up since is very much consistent with the move that you've had in equity. And so I would say we're in the midst of a gradual rebuild of risk premium and our view is that that process has room to go. Right. Well, just to clarify, we started at a very high level of the S&P 500 too. Absolutely. Absolutely. So we're still at high levels relative to history and we are coming from very tight levels in credit that are now wider. So talk to us about what's driven this big increase in spreads. Certainly uncertainty. Basically the gradual realization that we are in a macro environment with structurally higher volatility and certainly a lot higher volatility than many had anticipated going into the year. And so I would view that rebuild the premium as essentially a process in which spreads have to realign themselves with that new reality. We can talk about the impact of tariffs, but at the end of the day, what they do, they essentially shift the trade off between growth and inflation in a direction that is not that friendly for risk assets and credit in particular. And so until you recalibrate things back into a friendlier trade off between growth and inflation, I think you should continue to expect to rebuild the premium. The three other things I would add really, one, you're absolutely right. I mean, valuations do matter when uncertainty is elevated. It didn't matter last year when the economy was steadily growing, the Fed was sort of delivering the cuts. Now we're in a different situation where you have to demand a high risk premium in the face of a risk distribution that looks very different. And so the fact that we started the year with very severe valuation constraints clearly put portfolios in a position of vulnerability. And then the two other things I would say is that, look, there are safer and competing alternatives to risk assets and credit, but cash still paying you 4%. Duration, look at where 10-year yields are, four and four and a quarter. If we have an accident in the cycle, duration can provide a very solid embedded hedge to multi-asset portfolios. And so what could reverse it? We'll see. Generally, an even bigger repricing of premium can actually reverse all of this because you attract new capital and people buy the dip. But our sense is that we're not there yet. But just to be clear, fundamentals themselves are not showing signs or meaningful signs of deterioration. And this is just all about concerns that they might, given some of these growth concerns in particular and inflation concerns you just highlighted? Yeah. I would describe this as a repricing of risk premium as opposed to tangible signs of deteriorating fundamentals. But you're absolutely right. I guess the tension is between spot data, which is looking pretty good, and then that's true whether you look at macro or standard econ activity type of data, or also whether you look at corporate balance sheets. In general, I think things look pretty firm. The forward signal, however, is a totally different story. And I think the fact that that forward signal has turned more negative is enough in our view to justify a bit of repricing of premium. And so it is a repricing of risk premium as opposed to nervousness, at least at the moment, over the prospect of an abrupt deterioration in fundamentals. Right. And because ultimately, the risk of recession does seem to have gone up fairly materially in the last several weeks. Incrementally. Off of very low levels, again. Right. Right. And so that's something I think we should be very clear about. We're not forecasting spreads going to recession levels. We are saying that we've had a couple quarters now where spreads were stuck at the very low end of the historical range. They should gradually go back to levels that are closer to historical medians in order to reflect that new reality, which is elevated macro volatility, and then incrementally higher recession risk off of a very low level, too. And the market is far, just to be clear, from actually pricing a recession. I mean, how much farther would spreads widen in a real recessionary scenario? The recession narrative, I would say, has come back in client conversation. That is unquestionable. If you look at levels, we're still far away from getting close to recession levels. So just to give you a little bit of sense, if you look at the IG bond index, it trades at a spread of roughly 95 basis points. Recession levels would probably imply levels that are closer to 200 basis points. And so you would have to double, basically, the amount of premium to get to those levels. And if you look outside of the U.S., the news seems to be better out of Europe. So is this just a U.S. phenomenon? What are we seeing in Europe, and does that make credit markets more attractive in Europe rather than the U.S.? Europe has performed very strongly. I mean, it's performed strongly on the equity side, but also on the credit side. A lot of that is obviously a reflection of better growth sentiment there. You will spend more on the fiscal side. So that is stimulative to growth, while the U.S., we've essentially injected a meaningful dose of policy uncertainty. And so markets took the opposite direction. Can that outperformance extend on a forward basis? I mean, I'll talk about credit. When I look at European credit, I think it can continue to outperform in relative terms. But I think the scope for more tightening in absolute terms is quite limited. I mean, it would be very unusual, actually, to see those two markets diverge. History tells you that that actually rarely happens. But then more importantly, because Europe outperformed so well, actually, over the last two months, European spreads are essentially back to the same valuation contender that US dollar spreads were stuck into for most of 2024. And so you do have pretty binding, I would say, valuation constraints in the Euro market. So to me, it's a relative play. Sure, I think growth sentiment is better. You're going to spend more. And so you have a tighter range of outcomes from a policy standpoint in Europe. But in absolute terms, I think the bulk of the outperformance is behind us. Right. And ultimately, it feels as though a lot of the good news is therefore priced in Europe. Absolutely. So when you take a step back, where does this really leave credit investors at this point? Where do you think credit spreads are heading? So our view, again, is that you're set up for a gradual sort of reversion towards historical medians. If you look at the IG index as an example, again, we're roughly at 95 basis points today. We think you'll peak at an average of 120 to 125 basis points. That is actually, it seems like a big move from current levels. But if you take that number and put it in historical context, you're sort of at the median of the last 25 to 30 years. And so it's a little bit of a 2018 type of playbook where the market is set to continue to digest this uncertainty. As a result of that, you will continue to build some risk premium. That's a spread conversation. The total return conversation is a very different one because if you're a total return investor, you have good support from the risk-free component or the treasury yield component. Yields are still high, at least relative to the history from 2010 to today. And I think it's still very tough actually to derail total returns because one of the really interesting shifts that's been taking place the last couple of months is that the correlation between bonds and risk assets is actually back to where it used to be pre-2022. And so if spreads widen hypothetically to more than we think, to 150 basis points because actually the odds of a recession are going up, you will get a solid embedded protection from the yield component. And so your price return over at least a two to three month period is unlikely to dip into negative territory very much. And so the bar is high I think when you think about total returns for bonds. The bar is really high for those total returns to turn deeply negative, which is a big shift relative to 2010, 2019 when actually the investment grade market was pretty much a spread product because the base yield component was very thin. You didn't have that cushion basically that would act as a line of defense when the cyclical outlook deteriorates. Right. And then if you think about the overall landscape of assets and products that you look at, are there pockets that are actually more resilient if we do see growth concerns grow and materialize? We're directionally negative. So naturally that leaves a short beta a little bit. We do have strong conviction in owning agency mortgages relative to investment grade. And so that's a perfect example of a low beta asset class that is a lot less sensitive to these fluctuations or these phases of deceleration and growth. We like it for a number of reasons. One, it's a bit more defensive, it's a lot actually more defensive than IG. And then number two, valuations are a lot more attractive than they are in IG. I mean, this is an asset class that has no credit risk and yet it pays you a very generous success premium relative to IG. Of course, there are reasons why that's the case. We could talk about it. But it's a good example of an asset class that gives you good income, a bit of excess spread and it has the ability to withstand potentially a period of slower growth. Away from that would be up in quality. We had two years where we kind of like carry over quality. We were comfortable owning double Bs versus triple Bs. At some point, we were even comfortable owning triple C rated bonds, which are really at the low end of the quality spectrum and high yield. We switched that view a little bit. I think if you're directionally negative on the market, you kind of have to be up in quality too. Talk to us just for one more minute though, because your comment about mortgages was interesting. A lot of people I feel like think that housing and mortgages are quite cyclical and exposed to some of these risks, but you're saying they're not. Yes. These are agency mortgage-backed securities and so they do benefit from an implicit guarantee from the US government. There is really no credit risk embedded in them and there's very little correlation with the performance of the housing market. What you're really taking a view on is the risk of prepayments of these mortgages, nothing more. But as far as credit risk goes, unless you're nervous over the credit worthiness of the US government, but there's- That's another conversation. Exactly. There's virtually no credit risk basically in there. Understood. If the Trump administration walks back, some of the news and announcements that have really increased the growth and recession fears on tariffs, for example, and equities bounce, will credit also reverse some of the recent moves? Sure. Yeah. I think if you recalibrate the policy agenda away from measures that are negative for growth back into some of the actions that are more pro-growth, absolutely. The one thing you need to hope for is that between now and then, there isn't enough damage that's been done to the economy so that the market is comfortable going back and mean reverting. But absolutely. I mean, in fact, actually the first three months, almost three months of the year, felt to me as if we skipped 2017 a little bit and we went straight into 2018 by delivering all the tariffs, et cetera. But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of pro-growth measures in the current agenda that could reverse things. I mean, deregulation is one of them, obviously tax cuts, all that is stimulative to growth. But the timeline is sort of key. I mean, you want to get there at a time when the economy is actually still holding up pretty well. So assuming that we don't get this better news or the concerns at least continue for a while, are you concerned that we are going to see more defaults and more actual deterioration in fundamentals that could then again inflict that damage you just mentioned? Yeah. So again, it really depends on what the baseline view is. Ours is that we're poised for some deceleration in growth and a temporary boost to inflation. And so I would expect that to fuel some deterioration in fundamentals, but not a lot. And so the widening in spreads that we envision is really a repricing of risk premium, i.e. investors demanding a higher premium against that risk as opposed to something that would be driven by rising defaults or negative ratings migrations because balance sheets are coming under pressure. Now, of course, if you look at the risk that we get a more severe deterioration in the cyclical outlook, that would certainly bring defaults back into the conversation. Always an interesting conversation. Latvi, thanks so much. Thank you. This episode of Exchanges was recorded on Friday, March 14th. I'm Alison Nathan. Thanks for listening.

I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by David Maracle, our chief U.S. economist in Goldman Sachs research. He joins me over the phone from Doha. David, welcome back to Exchanges. Thanks, Allison. Great to be back. So, David, there are so many tariff headlines coming at us. Help us cut through all of this. Where does the picture stand now, and how has that changed from your prior expectations? Sure. The tariffs that are now in effect raise the U.S.'s effective tariff rate by somewhere around three percentage points. Between Election Day and Inauguration Day, that's more or less what we were expecting. So the tariffs that have already taken effect are not necessarily larger, but we have raised our expectations for what will eventually come into place. Some of that was just seeing that they were willing to go ahead initially with these tariffs on Canada and Mexico and pulling them back. Some of it is commentary from President Trump and others in the administration that has made us think that a tariff on critical imports and a meaningful reciprocal tariff are probably also coming, maybe something on autos, and that all of this is going to wind up adding up to a more substantial increase than we expected. So actually, just last week, we raised our tariff expectations. We had been expecting a four to five percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate. Now we're expecting that it will all add up to about a 10 percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate. So that would be a larger increase in the effective tariff rate than we had anticipated before the new administration took office. So let's talk about the macro implications. Is inflation, which has been so much in focus, becoming a bigger concern off the back of all of this? If there were no tariffs this year, we would expect inflation to fall. If you look at the Fed's preferred core PCE measure from 2.65 at the moment to something like 2.1% by the end of the year. Now under our prior more moderate tariff assumptions, we thought maybe instead of falling to the low twos, inflation would stay at something more like the mid twos for the duration of the year. Our new larger tariff assumptions have a meaningful impact. They imply that instead we'll see a bit of a pickup and we'll wind up just short of 3%. In principle, even with the larger magnitude of the tariff increase, we're still talking about a one-time impact on the price level. Although one thing we're learning that's different than say 2019, the last time President Trump in his first term raised tariffs, is that the public is extremely alert to tariff increases. And as a result, you've seen a jump in some measures of inflation expectations. I still don't think this is as dangerous as say in a 2022 like environment where inflation or expectations are going up. Not because people are being bombarded with news about tariffs, but because they're actually experiencing high broad based inflation. But it is, I think a little bit of a surprise relative to what I might've expected several months back, just how focused businesses and consumers are on tariffs. And I would say at the very least, this is something to keep an eye on. The risk of the tariffs sparking broader price increases. And what about the risk that we see a hit to growth? I'm hearing the word stagflation a lot these days. How concerned are you that we could be in a stagflationary environment? So we have revised our inflation forecast up for the year and our growth forecast down for the year. So directionally, that would be the effect of tariffs, higher inflation, lower growth. I think using that word, at least in a U.S. context where most people have in mind when they hear stagflation, what we experienced back in the 1970s, a very weak labor market and very high, eventually double digit inflation, comparing what we're expecting even larger tariffs to do to that period seems to me inappropriate. So I think that the terminology is probably a little bit misleading, but the effect of the larger tariffs is to push inflation higher and growth lower. So what are we expecting for growth at this point then? So we've just cut our 2025 GDP forecast on a Q4-Q4 basis from 2.2% to 1.7%. So we took off half a percentage point to reflect the larger impact of tariffs, which hit economic activity through a few channels. First, just a tax-like effect on real disposable income and consequently on consumer spending. Second, we've tended to see a tightening in financial conditions around tariffs. It's been a lot less extreme than it was in Trump's first term, especially scaled to the size of the tariff increase, but we have seen some sell off in the equity market, for example. And third, I think the uncertainty that tariffs introduced are probably going to have a larger effect discouraging business investment than I would have thought a couple of months ago when it looked like the tariffs would be smaller in total and more narrowly focused on China. What about the risk of outright recession? Has it risen? We raised our 12-month recession probability from 15% to 20%. It's a pretty small increase and the thinking there was the increased risk is ultimately a consequence of policies that the White House is choosing to impose, and so it can always choose to stop imposing those policies or even reverse them if the economic data come in too weak. If we get the impression that they're moving ahead with even larger tariffs than we now expect, or if the White House just signaled that it's really committed to its policies, even in the face of weaker economic data, either of those developments might imply that the recession probability is higher. Recently, President Trump was asked about the risk of recession in the context of these policies and maybe somewhat surprisingly, he said that he didn't really want to talk about that or think about that rather than just maybe saying more strongly, well, we wouldn't let it come to that or we don't think it's going to come to that. In general, I think one gets the impression that the White House is willing to pursue policies that might imply more economic and political risk than it was willing to in its first term. Back in the first term, even at a time when no one was really that worked up about high prices or high inflation, when inflation was quite low, even then, they seemed to be pretty alert to the risk that higher tariffs that raised prices could antagonize the public and they held back on the largest round of consumer focused tariffs. This time around, I do think there's a little bit more willingness to take those sorts of risks, but we'll see how big that turns out to be. That does feel like a big surprise, David, doesn't it? I mean, we keep hearing that people think Trump is the stock market president, but he's sending different signals, as you just said, to that end. Yeah, I think that's right, that both President Trump and all members of the Cabinet have kind of signaled a willingness to take larger risks than the first time around, that President Trump has said that people might have to bear with him, that there might be some adjustment period. And that was part of the thinking in penciling in larger tariff increases. And I think it does highlight that the risks around even what we have, which at 10 percentage points would be much larger in the first term, that the risks around even our new forecast are two sided. So where does this leave the Fed? Obviously, market expectations of Fed cuts have moved pretty widely over the last 18 months, but recently have begun to shift again towards more cuts. Where do we think things are headed? Sure. In December and January, we generally thought that market pricing was too hawkish for a variety of reasons. For one thing, we thought if President Trump does only do moderate tariffs, we think there is enough underlying disinflationary pressure that inflation could come down to something where they might deliver so-called normalization cuts, moving back in the direction of neutral as inflation gets lower. We also thought that the probability of hikes was a lot lower than the market was implying, that people were being a little bit too quick to forget the lesson of 2019 when tariffs triggered what were called insurance cuts, where the Fed felt the need to push back preemptively against a potential weakening of the economy in response to the impact of and the uncertainty created by tariffs. Now the market has actually gone from being priced for a kind of flat path in the low fours to penciling in three cuts for the year. I would say we haven't made any change to our forecast. We still have two cuts this year and one cut next year, but our thinking about what would get you there has certainly changed. It's still possible that you would get normalization cuts on the back of lower inflation if tariffs come in smaller than we're currently expecting. But I do think they would have to be smaller. With our new baseline of a 10 percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate, we think that means inflation actually runs closer to 3% despite those offsetting disinflationary pressures. And that's just too high for the Fed to be cutting because they've had success on inflation. Even if we all feel like we have a decent sense of what the tariffs are worth, and even if we still feel like the underlying inflation trend is lower, 3% would be too high for normalization cuts. So I think the way to interpret what the market is now pricing is instead as 2019 style insurance cuts. I think that's possible. I would emphasize that with inflation expectations as measured in consumer surveys now quite a bit higher than they were before all of this tariff talk began, the bar for the Fed to deliver insurance cuts is going to be higher than it was in 2019. 2019, we didn't really see that much evidence that the economy was weakening. They went ahead and cut anyway. This time, I think they're going to need more supportive evidence in the form of weaker business and consumer confidence, weaker hard data, weaker financial market performance, some combination of all of that. I wouldn't say that the high level of inflation expectations means they can't deliver insurance cuts if things get bad enough. But I do think you would need more substantial evidence of that because it is going to be an awkward question for any central banker to answer, why are you cutting rates when inflation expectations are moving higher? So the bar is higher, but the risks are clearly higher as well. We have a number of tariffs that we think would raise the effective tariff rate substantially. Those tariffs would affect many, many countries, most of which would likely retaliate to some degree against US exports. So it's a possibility. There are two paths to cuts. But if we do see larger tariffs imposed, I think that the more plausible path would become the insurance cut scenario. So are you basically saying that the risks to our mainline scenario of three cuts that we've held for a while now is tilted towards the more hawkish side? In the very near term, I would say the Fed's preference is probably just to stay out of all of this. That is more or less what they've communicated, that they're not going to be in a position to make important decisions when there's so much uncertainty. Since Chair Powell said that at the January meeting, we've probably had, if anything, more policy uncertainty in the intervening period than anyone could have imagined. So I'm sure their preference is until things calm down a little bit, until they have a sense of what the White House is going to do, they would really rather not be adjusting the policy stance. So in the near term, I think that's where we are. In the medium term, I think it depends on the impact of the tariff policies on the economy. And I could see them delivering cuts later this year. We still have a couple penciled in. If those effects wind up being as negative or more negative than we think, and if we get a string of data points that raises some worry that left to its own devices, the economy might weaken more than the Fed wants. That was the scenario that led them to deliver cuts in 2019, the thought that they should prevent things from kind of continuing to get worse on their own by intervening, providing a bit of accommodation. Even if some of the tariffs end up being lower than we're currently expecting, and some of the tail risk is removed, is the uncertainty alone that's come up a number of times in our conversations? Obviously, we're all very focused on the uncertainty. Is that enough to do economic damage? How do you think about that as an economist? I think it is. There was a debate around this in 2019, and we actually took the other end of it. The narrative in markets and at the Fed at the time was that trade policy uncertainty was causing businesses to hold back on investment in a big way that was pushing the US economy potentially to the brink of recession, and that we really needed these rate cuts to make sure that things didn't go that far. Our own research suggested directionally, logically, all of this makes some sense, but kind of exaggerating the consequences. This time, I do think the uncertainty is more serious for investment and hiring decisions for two reasons. The first kind of simple, straightforward reason is just that the tariffs being proposed are much larger. In fact, the tariffs already in effect even are larger than in the first Trump administration. The second reason is a little bit more subtle. We showed in a recent analysis looking at industry winners and losers from the tariffs that US industry and Chinese industry don't overlap that much. US manufacturers don't use that many Chinese inputs in their own production, and they generally don't compete in the same output markets with Chinese producers. On top of that, back then, you only had one foreign government to worry about retaliating, and it largely retaliated against the manufacturing sector, at least retaliating in a big way. This time around, none of that is true anymore. If the White House does go ahead with some of these broader tariffs, for example, a tariff on critical imports or the proposed reciprocal tariff would affect a lot of countries, then far more US businesses would be affected on the input side, on the output side, or by potential foreign retaliation. Now they have to worry about retaliation from any of many foreign governments, and that retaliation could even stretch beyond the manufacturing sector to affect services first. So yes, I do think I was a skeptic last time around, but I do think the uncertainty is potentially more problematic this time. So what are you watching most closely from here to determine the impact of tariffs on the US economy and whether we're going to need to make more adjustments? After the Canada-Mexico tariffs, which I imagine were probably a surprise to most people, I think we're kind of resetting, and I would say most of the data we have in hand, even the survey data, is probably a little bit out of date at this point. So I would certainly think that after the latest round of tariff threats, you see some step down in business confidence next month. That's one thing that I'll look at. Many of the business surveys also have questions about capital spending expectations. That would be the most obvious straightforward channel through which tariffs could have an immediate effect on the economy, so that's something I'll look at too. Having said that, the survey data or the soft data have not been particularly reliable over the course of the last few years, so I would want to see some confirmation of that in the hard data as well. I think it's reasonable to think that all of the policy uncertainty, especially the trade policy uncertainty, but I would also throw into the mix some of the proposed government spending cuts, that those could affect both business investment and hiring. So we'll be watching closely the hiring numbers, and particularly exposed, I would say, would be the two sectors, healthcare and government, that have accounted for such a disproportionate share of hiring over the last couple of years. Exposed not through uncertainty about trade policy, but uncertainty about government spending. So that's what I would look for on the hiring side, and then we'll also be watching closely the business investment numbers. I'm a little bit concerned there, even apart from the tariffs, because over the last few quarters, business investment growth has not been very good. In Q4, it was outright negative, Q4 of last year, and in Q2 and Q3, it looked okay, but the numbers were flattered by Boeing finally being able to ship out a bunch of planes. If you take that out, actually over the last few quarters, we're starting from a fairly mediocre place on business investment, and now all of a sudden, companies have quite a bit to worry about. So we'll watch that carefully, too. I would say all of this should be viewed in perspective. We had a big post-election jump in business confidence. We are still, at least prior to the latest round of tariff threats, we were still at a level that, although it was below the post-election peak optimism, it was above pre-election levels, and it was certainly above the levels of the last couple of years when many companies have feared recession. I would also say that while it's perfectly reasonable to think that tariff uncertainty and policy uncertainty more broadly could deter investment, it's probably the case that fear of a looming recession, which was on many businesses' minds for a few years, probably deterred as much, if not more, investment. So I'm not sure in an absolute sense we're in a bad place just yet, but certainly I do think you could start seeing some of these uncertainty effects materialize in coming months either on the hiring side or the capital spending side, so that's what we'll be most focused on. Interesting. David, thanks so much for your time, and safe travels this week. Thanks, Alison. This episode of Exchanges was recorded on Monday, March 10th. I'm Alison Nathan. Thanks for listening.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2025-03-04 05:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Trump’s tariffs: Big talk or big action?\n**Episode ID:** 4510\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nPresident Trump has announced several tariffs in just the short time since his inauguration, and there are signs that bigger and broader tariffs could still be ahead. So is this mostly talk, or does Trump really intend to usher in a new era for international trade? I think everyone needs to really buckle up here because things are just getting started and it's likely to be even more unpredictable than the first term. I'm Allison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month, I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing, market-moving issues for our top-of-mind report from Goldman Sachs Research. In late February, I spoke to Jeff Garish to get an insider's perspective at what's driving Trump's tariff policy and what could be ahead. Jeff served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative for Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and industrial competitiveness during Trump's first term. He's currently a partner at Shagrin Associates, a law firm that focuses on international trade law. We started by asking Jeff what Trump is ultimately trying to accomplish with his tariff policy. The president really has several goals with respect to his trade and tariff policies. The first of those is to use tariffs to address unfair trade practices and correct significant trade imbalances with other countries. You hear the president talking a lot about how other countries treat us unfairly and about the big trade deficits that we have on a bilateral basis with other countries as well as with the world as a whole. So he wants to use his trade and tariff policy to address those problems that he sees. The second goal that he has is to rebuild U.S. manufacturing and grow jobs, particularly in that sector. Again, you hear the president talking a lot about the need to use tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the United States and bring the jobs back as well. The third goal that he has is to use tariffs and the trade actions that he takes to protect national security. There's a real concern that the president has and his team has that we're over-reliant on imports, particularly in certain key strategic sectors, things like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. We also saw during the pandemic the fact that we were completely reliant on imports and other countries, particularly China, for PPE, which was obviously a real problem and a strategic vulnerability for the United States. And also there's a real concern that he has and his team has about China's use of its industrial policy to dominate strategic sectors of the global economy. And he wants to use his tariffs and trade policy to counteract that. The fourth goal that he uses tariffs for quite a bit is to gain leverage for negotiations. We saw that in the first term with his use of tariffs to get the phase one trade agreement with China, as well as the threat of auto tariffs to get a trade agreement with Japan as well. And to a more limited degree, the use of tariffs in the USMCA negotiations. The final two goals are ones that are a shift from the first term to the current term. And one of those is the use of tariffs to address what I would call non-trade, non-economic foreign policy or geopolitical issues. We've seen that with the threat of tariffs against Colombia, on immigration issues, the use of tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China relating to border security and fentanyl trafficking and the potential use of tariffs or threat of tariffs against Denmark relating to Greenland. The other area which has been a shift is the greater focus on using tariffs to raise revenue. I don't think anyone thinks that we're going to replace the income tax as a basis for revenue for tariffs, but the tariff revenue can help to offset some of the tax cuts that the president would like to implement. Thanks for laying that out. What do you think is most misunderstood about this approach to trade policy? I think the first thing that's misunderstood is the fact that there is a plan and that there is a strategy. And the strategy really is to achieve the goals that we just talked about, even though it appears to the people outside the administration that this looks erratic or haphazard. The president is showing that he's not going to go softly here. He's going to go at this in a really hard way and go as close to the deadline as possible to get action. And then if the action isn't taken that he wants, he will move forward with those tariffs. And even if he pulls it back, it's because there have been actions taken to address the concerns or at least enough done to postpone the action to make sure that other actions are taken. One of the biggest surprises, I think, to the market was the announcements around our major allies and trading partners like Canada, Mexico. But given everything that you know and the goals that you had laid out, does it feel to you like this is more on the camp of negotiating tactics or tariffs that he really wants to see put in place? I think it's more in the realm of negotiating tactics. I really do. Again, he's looking to take big action on the border and on the fentanyl crisis. And I think he's just looking to get as much as he can done on that and declare victory. And I do think the Canadians and Mexicans are really doing their best to try to meet those goals in terms of giving him enough that he can declare victory on that. And that would be a big win for the president early on in his administration. But it's been unclear, I think, to many people as to what exactly Canada and Mexico need to do to satisfy the president. Right now, I think it's very uncertain what's going to happen. 25% tariff on autos has been an area of focus. Do you think that goes in the camp of negotiating tactic or more likely to be implemented? I think it likely goes more into the camp of a negotiating tactic. He used it very effectively in the first term to bring more investment into the United States in auto manufacturing. So I can see him doing that in this context as well. And I think it fits also into what he's going to try to do through the USMCA negotiations, which I think one of the focuses there is going to be on how we make sure that we keep as much of the auto manufacturing here in North America, but particularly in the United States. And they're going to want to, as part of those negotiations, tighten up the rules of origin to make sure that happens. But I think he's using it primarily as a negotiating tactic. Now, if he's not getting the kinds of traction and results that he's seeking, then he could potentially move forward on that. And he was ready to move forward in the first term. So I could very well see him wanting to move forward. But I think primarily at this point, it's a negotiating tactic. When it comes to things like steel, how committed do you think he is to actually implementing those tariffs? Oh, I think he's very committed to that. I think there is a real recognition, and certainly in the first term, of the importance of the steel and aluminum industries in the United States for national security reasons. And the real threat that the influx of imports of those products, the impact that had on the steel and aluminum industries at the time that the original action went into place, there had been a flood of imports coming in from around the world. And the U.S. industry was really doing quite poorly. There were losses in the industry, capacity utilization in the industry was very low. And those tariffs really did have a major impact in really helping the industry, both the steel and aluminum industry, leading to additional investments in the industry. Again, we're back in a situation where steel companies are suffering losses. The aluminum industry is in a difficult spot as well. So I think he's very much committed to taking strong action. As you saw with the announcement, he's removing exclusions, removing country exemptions. He wants to try to do this in a way which removes the limitations on the impact of the tariffs. Now, I think he's going to get a lot of pushback on that, not only from downstream industries, including those who will argue that they cannot get certain products from the U.S. industry, and then also from Capitol Hill, because those companies also will be talking to their members and there's going to be, I think, likely some pushback there and requests to put in place an exclusion system of some sort. So that's going to be interesting to watch. But right now, the president is very much focused on being strong and extending those tariffs. Of course, he's extended them to derivative products as well. How likely do you think blanket tariffs will be on a broader range of products? And what is that most likely to encompass? So I think the president is looking to go bold and broad with respect to tariffs. He's looking to address the overall problem that we have with the global trade imbalance. Now, we've seen a decline in the trade deficit that we have with China following the imposition of the Section 301 tariffs. But with that decline that we've seen with the trade deficit with China, the trade deficit with other economies like the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, India, Thailand and other countries has exploded. So he's already showing that he wants to take expansive actions to bring down our overall trade deficit. Now he could do that a few different ways. We've of course heard him talk a lot about the global baseline tariff. He talked about that during the campaign quite a bit, global baseline tariff of 10 to 20%. That would be the minimum across the board tariffs on all products from all countries, many of which currently have zero or very low tariff rates. The more recent announcement he made was on potentially putting in place a reciprocal tariff system. That's under consideration. That would be a major, I would even say fundamental change to the global trading system. It's a little unclear at this point whether if he did go forward with reciprocal tariffs, if that would take the place of the global baseline tariff that he's talked quite a bit about. That may very well be the case. But I do think the president is looking to really take strong action across the board. It sounds like he's think there is a high chance of either a broad reciprocal tariff and or a universal tariff. Yes, I agree with that. A lot of our clients are very focused on whether VAT is included. There's different ways to calculate the reciprocal tariff. If you had to wager which direction he was going to go, a broader implementation or reciprocal tariff seems more likely to you. It does seem more likely to me. I think the president and his team see that the unfair treatment of the United States in the trade context is not just based on tariffs. It certainly is reflected in the different tariff rates that are set by countries around the world. But there's also the problem with non-tariff barriers, which can be in certain instances just as big of a problem as the tariffs themselves. So I think he will want to try to address that. Now, it is going to be complicated that you're trying to measure how to put a tariff at a level that reflects the non-tariff barriers that are in place in certain countries, particularly systems that are fairly opaque with respect to those matters. That's going to be somewhat difficult and challenging. But I think that is something they are going to try to address. So it sounds like you think Trump is going to do something very big on tariffs. But the market hasn't seemed to believe that. What do you think the market isn't believing or why is that at this point? I think it's just such a radical change. And I think the market may not expect that the president would be willing to take such an action. But I think that's a miscalculation because the president, especially in the trade and tariff realm, tends to do what he says he's going to do. And he has people in the administration who very much are trade hawks and will want to take bold action with him. Now, as with the first term, there's a range of different perspectives in the administration. Certainly I would put Jameson Greer and Peter Navarro and probably Howard Lutnick in the trade hawk camp. But there are others, including Treasury Secretary Besant and some of the other economic officials who are less hawkish on those issues. But even if you look at past treasury secretaries, I think Besant tends to lean more in favor of tariffs than many of them have in the past. So I think the market may be miscalculating on this. What would your key message be to investors who are trying to understand what's next on tariff and trade policy? I am confident that the bulk of the tariff developments still lie ahead. I think what we've seen so far is really just the beginning. And I think the president is just getting started at this point. I think something that I'm really watching closely is the outcomes of the various studies and reports that will be issued on April 1st, pursuant to the America First trade policy memo that was issued on Inauguration Day. In that memo, the president directed his trade team to conduct a comprehensive review of a number of different trade and tariff actions that could be taken and to report back on that, of course, on April 1st. And I think those reports could lead to a whole host of tariff actions. So I think there's a lot still to come. I think everyone needs to really buckle up here because things are just getting started and it's likely to be even more unpredictable than the first term. But Trump is a business guy and he understands business and he knows that business does not like uncertainty. Does that weigh on his mind at all? They know it and they embrace it because they think that it will bring back more manufacturing, bring back more companies, bring back more jobs to the United States. The only way to gain certainty is by doing that. And they want to push that as much as they possibly can. So I think they are embracing the uncertainty. They are fully aware of it. But I think they think it's helpful to achieve the goals that they ultimately want to achieve. So some valuable insights from Jeff Garish on how Trump is thinking about tariffs and what that could mean for what's to come. Now there is another question here, which is the legality of all of these tariffs. So when I spoke to Tim Brightbill, co-chair of Wiley Rains International Trade Practice, he told me that while Trump's tariff actions will likely face legal challenges, the tariffs announced so far are arguably within the president's authority, which could mean that most of these challenges will likely fail.

I'm Tony Pasquarello, Global Head of Hedge Fund Coverage and Global Banking and Markets and Co-Head of 1GS. And today I have the great pleasure of sitting down with my friend, Paul Britton. Paul is the founder and CEO of Capstone Investment Advisors, a global investment firm with about 11 billion in asset center management. Capstone focuses on derivatives and strategies that capture alpha and protect against downside risk. Capstone recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. And so this will be a great opportunity to discuss how the investing landscape has changed in the past two decades and where opportunities could be now. Paul, thanks for doing this. Thanks for being here. You're welcome. Lovely to be here. Thank you for the invite. So I want to get your take on the current environment, but let me just go back to the beginning. Let's just start the beginning of Capstone. What were the origins? What was the impetus? Why did you decide to launch the business in 2004? My DNA is in the options market-making space. And we built a relatively successful firm. And then I moved over to the States in 2000, 2001 to look to expand our European operations into the US. By 2003, 2004, I realized that the market-making business and the providing liquidity business was really becoming a technology arms race. So the more CapEx you would spend, the higher probability that you had of being the most successful in the game. So it felt to me that it was a winner-takes-all game. And who knows? Today, I could be sat here of having Capstone Securities and competing alongside Goldman Sachs Securities or Citadel Securities. It's a relatively low probability outcome. So I said, you know what? I think that there's an opportunity to... It always frustrated me of not knowing what was going on on the other side of the world and what was going on in other asset classes. So I said, you know what? I'd like to build a global business. I'd like to build a business that encompassed every asset class. And I think this is useful for institutional investors. And I certainly didn't have that fully formed in terms of what the end game looked like. But that really was how I thought about it at the beginning, to build a big global business that covered every asset class. Right. And who knows? But I think we'd probably agree, the instinct was probably correct, that the path you struck was the right one. Listen, I can't complain. I sat here with you. 11 billion later. And I remember distinctly people being like, gosh, if you ever get to a billion dollars, and that sounded incredibly scary to me. And then you just, you trust the process, you trust the people around you, and you're sharing your story and your vision with investors to be able to see whether investors buy into that narrative and that story as well. And along that path, when was the first moment where you thought, okay, I think I'm onto something big? So I remember distinctly January of 2008. This story ends badly, by the way. But it was one of those first aha moments where I'm like, wow, this could actually really work. And it was MLK Day in January of 2008. And one of the large European banks disclosed that they had a potential issue. And there was an awful lot of volatility on that holiday day in the US. And we made a decent amount of money. And that was one of the moments where I'm like, oh, this is, I get this. You have sizable capital, where you can put reasonable amounts of risk on, and you're going to get rewarded for that. And that was my first kind of aha moment of saying, all right, this has to be a scalable business. And I see how this can really work. And if you push forward to say the year 2020, was that another signpost when you said, what we have built in scale is here to last? Because that was a spectacular year for what you do. Yes. The January 2008 story was great. We made a lot of money for investors. We did spectacularly well. But it gave us, looking back at it, a real false confidence. And then it went spectacularly wrong in Q4 2008, where we realized that, or I realized that, we didn't have the appropriate rigor framework around risk that we needed to. And then fast forward to 2020, where you had an extraordinary event. It was, now, there's lots of sleepless nights, but you could feel that the framework was there. And the level of comfort that gives you as an investor, as a business owner, knowing that all the processes are in place, people know exactly what to do, that was a very gratifying year. And not because we made money for investors, or it's just that things worked as they should have done. And that really comes from the experience, the lessons, the mistakes, candidly, the stupidity of things we've done in the past. And then 2020 was really a test to see whether we've learned or not. And was there any other moment or period of time, again, along those 20 years that were particularly difficult for you or for the business, outside of the fever pitch of crisis like 2008 or 2020? I think that the most difficult from an investment standpoint was definitely Q4 of 2008. I'm not particularly religious, but I remember going to the bottom of Broadway at the intersection of Wall Street, there's a beautiful church called Trinity Church right by here. And I remember distinctly going there on a regular basis, not because I was seeking solace from a higher power, but I found it so overwhelming of what was going on. And I needed a place of solace and a place to try and collect my thoughts and definitely ask for help from a higher power to be able to try and help me get out of this mess I'm in. And so I'd end up having these wonderful conversations with these terrific vicars and priests at Trinity. And then I'd come in on a relatively frequent basis and they'd be like, how are the volatility markets today? Right, right. And so that was a moment in time of extreme stress, but acknowledging that you're literally putting one foot forward and learning from the process. So from an investment standpoint, but that ultimately defined the firm. Sure. Big pivot off that. Let's talk about the derivatives market. It is a hallmark of what you do, how you take risks, how you manage risk. You're an options guy. I came up in the business as an options guy. The derivatives market has expanded hugely in the past decade or two, particularly I'd say in the COVID, post COVID era. Has that opened up the opportunity set for what you want to do or has it made it more crowded, more difficult? How has that all played to your strengths or to your detriment? So when we started this back in 2004 and we took in institutional money in 2007, that discussion around what size, what capacity could you really be? I was surprised by investors would always push back on us becoming bigger than 500 million or, because when I looked at the size of the derivatives market, it was just enormous, even back in those days. And so 20 years ago, I think the derivatives market was really used by the professional community and less in... And there was certainly big pockets of retail participation. But what I think has happened over these past 20 years is the evolution of the derivatives market to make them more mainstream and to make them more appealing to a broader audience. And there's lots of people that I think have done a very good job around the exchanges, the dealers, the banks, et cetera, to be able to figure out ways of enhancing the derivative offering to a wider group of participants. For us, that's good, meaning that as long as there is more volume going through those pipes, then that should translate into a higher alpha proposition. Just simply that if there's more volume going through those pipes and there's more volume going through our filters, then that should translate into a higher alpha proposition for our investors. It sounds like one part of that is liquidity begets liquidity. In other words, if the market's getting bigger because of more market participants, you can take more risk and scale your risk. But also, it's going to create alpha opportunities because not all of that money, not all of that capital flow will be as elite, perhaps, as you all. Is that fair? Yeah. And it's not even elite. It's that the great thing about the derivatives markets is people use them for different reasons. If everyone just focused on the volatility component of the derivatives markets, that would be a challenge for us. They don't. They focus on using derivatives for a whole variety of different reasons. And even when you speak to some participants of the derivative markets who are sizable participants in them and sizable users of derivatives, they don't really care about the same alpha factors that I do. That's not to say that we're elite. It just means that we're after something different to the average participant and the average user of the derivatives markets. And that's what I think makes what we do relatively unique and a relatively unique source of alpha for investors. Got it. And then you are a US-based firm. You're a downtown-based firm, which I think actually owes some of its heritage to 9-11 and your commitment to stay downtown post 9-11. But you're running very much global business. So how much of your time is spent in non-dollar markets? Obviously, the US market is enormous top to bottom, but are you also taking a fair amount of risk across Europe, across Asia, on and on? If you think about the global footprint, you can draw parallels to where the largest pools of volume is. That typically correlates into our risk-taking in terms of saying that our largest risk exposure has always historically been the US, just simply because the volumes here in the US have been the greatest. An interesting market that we're looking at and exploring and have some exposure in is also the China markets. They have a very large, deep equity market, less on the derivative side. But that is essentially how we think about our exposure from a risk standpoint. Volumes first, that should equate to the alpha pi being the greatest. And then our role is simply mining that alpha and then extracting alpha from those markets. Okay. And then let's just flash forward to the current day. There's a lot going on in the world. Yes, there is. We have this upending of a traditional political order. We have a very disruptive set of technologies in part colliding in real time. We have a very concerning and dynamic geopolitical backdrop. The VIX is at 15. How do you square that circle? I square it because if you think about what is trying to be accomplished for this new administration, you have on one side, a very pro-growth, pro-business agenda, which you imagine would be constructive for asset prices. The way that the agenda is being formulated and being presented is unconventional. And that's, I think, the push and pull of what markets are trying to digest. If we're sat at this table in three years time, and we look back as to where we were sat here today, I imagine that we're going to look at one another and say, well, that was pretty obvious. Why didn't we do that? Why didn't we have more of that? But because it's an unconventional, unpredictable manner of how policies are being implemented, I think that can be confusing and draw anxiety from the marketplace. So if you didn't have that, you could maybe make the case that the VIX could be lower, because clearly President Trump's policies and campaign pledges were very pro-growth and very business friendly. And so you would imagine that would be supportive of risk assets and thus less volatility in the system. I also think that there is an enormous amount of dispersion. Which is a big business for you. Which is a big business, where one day you have a stock or a sector that perhaps gets mentioned, and that can cause terrific volatility. But it's stock or sector led, and that is not necessarily at the macro level. So not to get too technical, but clearly realized correlation is extremely low, because you've had an awful lot of dispersion across different sectors, different stocks, et cetera. But ultimately, the indexes just haven't really moved that much. You've had big moves across the different sectors and stocks, but not necessarily that hasn't translated into big index led moves here in the US. I want to ask one question, which is, I think at your core, you are still a risk manager. You still retain that trading instinct, the risk management instinct. You're running a big business. You have many people working for you. But you wake up August 5th. I'm not sure where you were. I was in the middle of nowhere. I was 20 miles from the Arctic Circle. And I thought, oh, this will be interesting. And the VIX is at 65. I presume you take off the CEO hat for a moment, and you put on the head of trading, head of risk management hat. Yeah. The way I try and describe it is a business is a large casino. And people come in to the derivatives casino, and our rods are 51.49 on a regular day. When you get those types of events of the VIX moving at that level or distress going through the market, you have the ability, you have the odds change. And the odds go to 55.45 or 57.43. And so, I just encourage my teams to say, we want to play more. Because the odds now are more in our favor. For whatever reasons, there's more alpha available. And so, you have to trust your process. You have to trust your infrastructure, your systems. You've got to trust your instincts to be able to bet more. And to be able to, and bet meaning that- Play offense. Play offense. And put risk on. And that is still a work in progress, because it's difficult to do that when the VIX is at 65. Sure. Humans are human. Humans are like, let's shut the casino down. Right? I don't want to play because you don't know. Sure. You just don't know. Sure. I'm super curious what the answer to this question is. Because again, I've known you a long time, and I would have guessed a good bit of what we covered so far. But I have no idea how you're going to answer this question, which is, away from the hedge fund community, one of the biggest themes in recent years has been the rise of private assets. Yes. Private equity, of course, venture capital, of course, and the more locally private credit. Yes. Does it matter for what you do? Does that create opportunity or challenges for what you do day to day? It's kind of the after effects. So, I think the private industry has done an unbelievable job, has delivered outsized performance in certain areas, but it's a different part of the portfolio. I think some of the issues that we see historically over these past two, three years, the hedge fund industry and the private industry are competing for the same dollar. And we, the hedge fund industry, wants to be able to demonstrate to the end investor as to why we should play that role within the portfolio, and the private industry is doing exactly the same. I think over these past two, three years, there's just been a conversation, a dialogue around institutional investors, around this notion of liquidity. And so, I think there's a dialogue, an ongoing dialogue of saying, all right, how much liquidity do we need within a portfolio, an institutional portfolio? And that impacts Capstone in a couple of ways. One, you've seen hedge fund allocations, and Goldman wrote about this in a great piece that you just put out, that because the privates are not distributing as much over these past two, three years, that impacts allocations across the broader sector. To everything else. To everything else. Yeah. So, we've seen some of that occur. And then secondly, we've engaged with institutional investors around, how do you think about liquidity in your portfolio when you do have a large private allocation, and you are running these assumptions of saying, okay, if you do have a drawdown, what do you think your net distributions and net outflows capital calls are going to be? And so, it's interesting that it's less about like a tail hedge, but it's more about of a liquidity function. Super interesting. That they look to be able to say, we don't want to be in a position if the market's down 25%, we have to raise liquidity because of capital calls, we don't want to be selling equities. So, we want to be able to think about ways where we can have a strategy that helps us deal with that liability that we know we have. And I think that makes all the sense in the world. The way I think about it is that if the private market has demonstrated over the last 20 years that it can deliver 300 basis points over the benchmark, then I think it makes all the sense in the world to say, let's invest 20 basis points, 30 basis points, 50 basis points, to help that portfolio be more liquid. Rather than just simply relying on it to pay out over seven, 10 year cycle, why not use some of that outperformance to make a good strategy great? And those are interesting conversations for us. Super interesting. I want to go back to Paul Britton, the CEO. How do you think about managing people and risk? Working at Capstone is an unbelievable experience. I'm slightly biased. But it's very fast paced. And I say to people, if it's not fast paced, that's a problem. That's right. That's a real problem. Because the evolution and the innovation in the business goes at such a rate that if you aren't fast paced and you aren't moving, then you're dying. Right. And that's the thing that keeps me up at night. Sure. It is like you've got to drive the car at a sensible pace, meaning you can't be in a position where you are going too fast because you can run the risk of having a wreck and coming off the road. But the thought of going too slow and seeing who's behind us in our rear view mirror, that motivates me. And that's what keeps me up at night. It is an element too of the hedge fund business, which is a little bit unique, which is every day, it's a bit of a knife fight. It is. Every day. It is. You're going to compete every single day. Every single day. And it's not to say other fields of investment are any easier, but the lived experience in a trading seat is very demanding. Yes. All right. Here's a tough one. You're going to come back here in five or 10 years. We're going to sit down, we'll do this all over again. If you had a hazard to guess, what do you think we'll say about the path that the market took or the economy took? I think that these past 17 years have been an anomaly post GFC with the intervention, maybe it's a strong word, participation, contribution of central banks over these past X amount of years, I think was an anomaly. Their presence. Their presence and their participation. And I think that central banks were critical in that early phase of stabilizing markets. And I don't really have a better answer or solution of what they did to be able to ensure that the financial market survived and the financial system rebounded from where it was, but I think they just overstayed their welcome. And I think that they got enamored with this notion of getting into the growth game with all good intentions of saying, I think that we can play a role of being a growth partner to this economy. And I think that that won't happen again. Now, I think that that's also this notion of having a Fed put is the size of that put, I think has gone down dramatically. And so that to me who runs a trading organization, really, it's just much more interesting. And it would frustrate me of seeing central banks be very active in wanting to calm markets, wanting to participate in markets, which I didn't think necessary they had a place and let free markets do what they should do. So I think that's the biggest change over the next five, 10 years that we will see. I think that translates into the elasticity of markets being greater. So this notion of you could see perhaps the VIX at 10, where really the fair value of it should be at 15, but because of liquidity issues or whatever it is that you're going to get the elasticity, and that will be the same on the upside as well. And then I also think these correlations that we have relied on historically, I'm not too sure whether they're as stable or as reliable as what we have become comfortable with. Yes. I sent this around a couple of weeks ago, but we did some very basic analysis on the performance of a 60-40 stock bond portfolio as compared to a hedge fund portfolio in kind of the five years that marked the end of the secular stagnation new normal era. It's called 2015 through 19. And then the past five years of the COVID, post COVID era. And it kind of gets to your point, which is when the stated policy goal was to get to the zero bound and suppress volatility. No surprise, 60-40 outperformed hedge funds, actually only by a little bit, but they did nonetheless. And that stuff is generally accessed for very little cost. Against that in the past five years, hedge funds have meaningfully outperformed almost 2x 60-40 on better volatility, on lower volatility. And so my guess is, I think you are on the same page now. We're not unbiased in this regard because we're rooting for hedge funds, of course. But my guess is if you're right, then the future will be favorable for active management and for what hedge funds do, the best hedge funds do. And I think that there has to be... Economies are having to deal with their COVID responses. They're still having to deal with their COVID responses because of the seismic response that central banks made. And that's going to be felt for many, many, many years to come. And so this notion of between 2008 and 2020, that you would have a coordinated response from the G5 of, okay, we're all going to lower rates by 25 days or whatever it is, I think that's gone. And that really is, I think, good news for the industry because now you don't have this coordinated response. You have real dispersion around policymaking and central bank interventions or responses, et cetera. And I think that's good from an alpha perspective. Okay. A couple of questions for the road, quick ones. What skills do you think make a world-class investor? Follow your process. Process will always get you out of trouble and be curious. Got it. So curious around, don't believe that your process is always going to be... Your process can always be improved, refined, augmented, and you get that through being curious. So be disciplined, but be curious. Yes. It's an interesting pairing. Yes. What's your greatest strength as a CEO? I think consistency is key in great CEOs that people want to feel as though that they know what they're going to get. Now, there'll be lots of people within my organization being like- Last Tuesday. Yeah. I don't know whether that's that accurate, Paul, but I try to be as consistent as possible so that people always know what they're going to get, whether it's good or bad, but they know what they're going to get. And secondly is to, as a CEO, show some vulnerability. As a human. Yeah. You're a human too. People respond to this notion of when I'll sit in a meeting and be like, I really didn't understand any of that. And there's lots of people that will be like, is he really as dumb as what I think he is? And having that vulnerability and humility to be able to say, I'm really sorry, I just didn't understand any of that. It then allows people to be like, oh, okay. I can show vulnerability as well. Got it. And then you create, I think, a better culture. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? It was from my grandparents. And my grandfather was a fruit and veg trader. And he always told me the importance of working hard. And then I had this crazy Scottish grandmother who was just an avid traveler. And they certainly weren't wealthy, but at any opportunity, they'd always be going around the world. And that's what she said to me. She says, the greatest gift is seeing the world. Which investor do you admire most? That's a good question. I'd have to say, I didn't know Mr. Simons, the late Jim Simons, but I'd always try and find a time of listening if he did talks, et cetera, talking about curiosity. And clearly, he had an IQ 10,000% more than me. But you could always tell this, that there was a level of curiosity, which allowed him to always be at the forefront of what they did. And I think his philanthropy was he always spoke so much about his mission, his purpose. And that really resonated with me. He had that great quote, I did a lot of math, I made a lot of money, and I gave most of it away. And that's to me, again, humility and what our greatest purpose should be. That's right. Where do you spend your time outside the office? So I used to, for those of you who are listening to this from the audio, I'm wearing a boot. I have torn my Achilles on a tennis court. So I love tennis. I love sports. I've always been active in sports. And now I am not so active with a repaired, torn Achilles. Last question. What are you most excited about in the world right now, Paul? I think there's an awful lot of discussion around the impact of AI. There's not a day, an hour goes past where we're discussing the impacts of it at Capstone. It's moving so quickly. And I'm fascinated as to see where it ends up. I'm fascinated to see the role it can play within industries, within my business. And it's got even more fascinating in terms of just you feel as though the price point and accessibility is going to be a game changer, which that really excites me from understanding how to use this within our businesses over the next three to five years. And as we sit here today, has it made a meaningful change in the productivity of Capstone as yet in the game? We're a relatively small firm, right? Compared to Goldman Sachs, we have 330, 340 staff, but we have an ambitious goal and target of trying to save 50,000 hours. And I do these small get togethers called Cap Chats of five or six individuals within the firm. And my message is quite straightforward. It's, if you have a workflow, a work function that is repeatable every day, you have to be thinking about using this technology to be able to automate it. Because if you don't, then you are at risk. Because in three or five years time, I believe, and there's definitely a segment within my organization that thinks within nine, 12 months, this is all going to be done. And I think that's the interesting question. But if you have a repeatable task, I don't want you doing that because I want you doing tasks and work that are higher value. And that's good for me. That's good for you. And I think that's how humans stay ahead of the game with this first phase. So that's how my message within my firm is, this is an unbelievable tool that has to be harnessed to be able to the first phase is to be able to reduce the repetitive workflows that we have within the organization so that we have the ability to work on other higher value workflows. Okay. Well said. We're going to leave it there. Paul, thank you for doing this. Thank you so much for the invite.

So what impact do they have on the economy and on markets? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm sitting down once again with Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, and Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in the Global Markets Research Group. Jan, Dom, it's great to have you back on Exchanges. And to continue the dialogue we began last November, soon after President Trump was elected. Great to be with you. Thank you. On one, I last spoke to you and Dom in November. We were discussing your outlook report for 2025. It was entitled with a question, which was, will tailwinds Trump tariffs? And I think it's fair to say that the answer at that time was probably, but we've now seen several announcements. We have a better sense, not a complete sense, of course, but a better sense of the tariff policy coming through in particular and many other Trump policies. So has your thinking shifted? Would you still answer the question the same way? I would still answer it exactly the same way, both in the sense that I think the tailwinds are probably going to Trump the tariffs, but also that there's still a probably there because we actually still don't know just how pervasive the tariffs are going to be. Of course, there have been some surprises in terms of the details, generally a little bit less focus on China, a little bit more focus on other things. And at the margin, it looks like the increase in the effective US tariff rate might be a little bit higher than what I would have said three months ago. We were thinking three percentage points or so. I could now certainly see something more in the four, five, six, seven percentage point range. And of course, that has some implications for economic activity and also inflation, but it's not really a major change from a big picture perspective. And I think the tailwinds that have been pushing the economy forward are also still very clearly visible. And therefore, our forecast from a growth perspective and from an inflation perspective hasn't changed substantially since the time we recorded the November podcast. We're still looking for about two and a half percent growth in the US. We still think that inflation is going to come down, core PC inflation is going to come down to something like two and a half percent by the end of the year. And in that environment, we still think that the Fed might deliver some additional rate cuts, although we have pushed that out to some degree. But in terms of the overall economic backdrop, I think it's actually remarkable how little has changed so far. Let me grab onto the inflation point really quickly because I think that is a primary concern in the markets right now. And we did get another set of inflation data that was broadly interpreted as hotter than expected. So that doesn't concern you at all is what I'm hearing. Not if I look at the measure that's most important to the Fed, which is core PCE after the CPI and PPI data. We think core PCE 0.3 percent, 30 basis points on the month, which is in line with or even a touch below what we were expecting before the CPI and PPI numbers for January. It is a higher number, of course, than the sequential pace that we've been seeing. But it was predictable that it would be a somewhat higher number because of the well-documented January effect, the tendency of sequential inflation to be higher and higher than the seasonal factors can necessarily adjust for in months like January when there are a lot of annual price resets following a period during which inflation generally was higher. This is a well-established pattern now. It was much more visible in 2023, 2024. And I think what we're seeing here is consistent with the idea that the catch-up inflation that's been still a force over the last couple of years, firms raise prices in order to catch up with previous cost increases that is gradually petering out. I'd also say if we do get 30 basis points for January, it would come after 11 basis points in November and 16 basis points in December. So that's still a fairly benign pace of inflation. Adam, if you think about how the markets have reacted to all of this news, so the tariff news and then some of this inflation news, is there anything surprising about how the markets are pricing this? I think mostly what's happened, and it reflects, again, some of the things that we talked about, is that it's become more complicated. I think the last few months of 2024 was relatively simple. We were essentially moving towards pricing the kind of growth picture that we've had in our forecasts, and you had a pretty consistent upgrade to growth across a range of assets. You had equities go up. You had yields go up. You had the dollar stronger. I think what's happened, particularly coming into the beginning of the year, is that the trade-offs across that group of trends has become more complicated. And I think that reflects three things. Part of it is just the uncertainty around policy, the uncertainty around trade policy. That certainly created back and forth within equities and asset movements up and down. It's made it a little bit more challenging for people to maintain their conviction that they understand the paths from here. And so some of that, I think, has probably contributed to a flattening out of that equity uptrend. The second thing, which Jan reflected to, is that the markets had to focus on a less dovish Fed. I would say most of that shift really started with the December FOMC, where the Fed signaled more reluctance than before to think about easing. But the uncertainty around policy is, as Jan mentioned, making it easier to envisage that the Fed postpones the start of easing further and that we're in an environment where rate cuts are slower in coming. That's not a major obstacle. The growth environment, the growth picture looks fine. But I think, again, it complicates the risk picture. The market now is more likely to see upside surprises to growth as something that stops the Fed from cutting, and there's more of a balancing act taking place there. I think the biggest thing and the thing that has changed, I think, relatively more in the markets than in the macro is just pricing. And so the challenge is not that the outlook has changed in a dramatic way, but that relative to when we spoke in November, the market has moved closer to a view that growth is going to be good, that recession risks are relatively low. That felt like a debate we were having with the market for a lot of the last couple of years. And it's just less of a debate at this point. And so part of the challenge is that baseline, still pretty friendly, but also reasonably well priced. And you've still got these tail risks that you need to balance against that. And I think that is inherently just a more difficult structure to invest around. What we've seen is, essentially, as those risks or the deep risks don't appear, markets are finding room to relax in places around that. And then you have the periodic but ongoing fear that the environment is going to change more significantly, which you still have to be cognizant of and wary of. If we think about how the markets have digested a lot of the tariff news, one thing that I think has been pretty clear has been the strength of the dollar. That seems in some ways to be the easiest asset to own in this uncertain environment. But it's run a lot, a little volatile, but run a lot. So where are you in that thinking about where the dollar goes from here? Yeah, it has a lot of the same elements that we talked about before in terms of just the challenge being the pricing. We've had a view, and we had a view back in November when we talked about it, that there were good reasons to think that this policy mix would continue to drive the dollar stronger. So there's both the outperformance of the U.S. economy and just that macro differential, but also the tariff policies that were coming and then the tail risk that's there. As you said, the challenge is not that any of that story has really changed. The challenge is just that the market has reflected that story to a greater degree. And I would say we're clearly pricing reasonable divergence between the U.S. and non-U.S. kind of growth and rate paths. And there's some tariff risk premium priced. It comes in and out, obviously, with the news, but the market is expecting tariff action to some degree. And so you've got a little bit more two-sided risk, which we've seen already. If tariffs aren't delivered, you get some relief. And so I think to a greater degree, a much stronger dollar, so real strength from here, probably does depend more on that tariff tail coming more prominently into focus. I think our view has been that there's value in the dollar from that perspective, that the prospects of a significant weakening in the dollar, given this backdrop, are relatively low. And that deep tail is still one that is worth protecting against. But I think that the case for that strength relies more on that balance. And what we've seen is that the risk that's priced into non-U.S. markets in China and Europe, when you're thinking about surprises and the question you asked earlier, that because we've already priced a lot of risk in that, you've had a relatively low bar for those markets to do better on the absence of some of the bad news that might be coming. So as long as we avoid the worst tails as well, there is some upward repricing. I think that's more an equity story than an FX story. And that's what we've seen so far this year, with our performance in Chinese and European equities being pretty meaningful already. But it does mean that the dollar's a more balanced proposition. But we think that deep tail on the tariff side, that it's still the primary place to get exposure to that, and it offers value within a portfolio to have that against your baseline positions. And if some of that deep tail does get realized beyond the dollar, are there other assets that you think could move significantly? Yeah, I think, again, from a market's perspective, the nice things about all the volatility and the ins and outs of this is we keep getting dry runs of what asset market reactions might be to more significant versions of things. And I think what we've seen is if there is significant and broad-based trade action, broad-based tariffs, very significant tariffs against major trading partners of the kind that were threatened against Canada and Mexico, and those stuck and were delivered for any meaningful period of time, I think beyond the dollar, we've seen that is something the market is likely to treat as an equity negative, both for the US and outside the US. There were meaningful reactions to that news until it was clear that it was going to be reversed, and that downside tail, I think, is also worth protecting against, but probably also underpriced. The rate side is more complicated. You're seeing upward pressure on near-term inflation views, which makes sense. That's where the direct translation goes through. What you saw, though, in the recent tariff reactions, which we think makes sense, is that the curve, essentially, the yield curve inverts, that the market thinks that the Fed may be slower to cut in the near term, but actually that the growth risks and inflation risks further out may end up pushing yields lower. So I think there are a bunch of places where the market is vulnerable if we move down that route in a much more aggressive way, and that is, in some sense, the opportunity and the challenge in terms of designing a portfolio that can withstand that, but also positions you for the central case. Amy Quinton Dom, I just have to ask, though, does it surprise you at all that the equity market is basically still at near-record highs amid all of this uncertainty? And we have had Fed cuts, but not nearly as many as we expected at one point. What are your thoughts? I think people are always surprised, other than equity investors who expect it, macro people are always surprised at the resilience of equities to all sorts of things. I think, as I said, the reality is the equity market's flattish since the end of November, so we've definitely altered the trajectory in terms of the uncertainty. But I think what we're seeing is a couple of things, one, going back to where we started, there are tailwinds, so the basic macro environment is still a pretty friendly one. Growth is good. The Fed is still in a position to cut if growth stumbles. The inflation environment is not yet, you know, challenging in a way that really changes that. Earnings have been strong. Earnings have been strong. We've had some, obviously, some challenges on the AI side, but the general view has been that's more of a reallocation within the equity market, and it may change the mix of profitability, but doesn't change the overall optimism there. And I think one of the things you're finding is there's a little bit of a wall of worry dynamic. There is some reticence and acknowledgement that some of these trade and tariff risks might appear. And as of this point, we have not realized any of them in a major way. We have some tariffs against China, which were by and large expected and perhaps a little less than what's ultimately expected. And most of the others, we've seen threats, but we've not yet seen realization. And so I think in that environment with some hesitancy priced into the market, the natural tendency will be if that continues for the market to drift slowly higher. As I said, we've really not made that much progress. The real progress has been made this year. China and Europe, at least offshore China, are up more than 10%. That tells you where the scope for relief is there. And I think you are getting an indication that the US is priced for more good news already when you see that mix. But I do think our base case is still at least moderately friendly for equities. And the longer you keep avoiding those tails, the more you're going to have this gradual upward pressure, I think, on risk markets. Yeah. Let me ask you about something else that I find somewhat surprising, which is we do have tenure yields above 450. They've been volatile, very volatile right down. But ultimately, they're still very high and higher than we had expected. And at some point when I was having all these conversations, that was viewed as potentially very problematic for the economy. But we haven't seen that. Or have we? I mean, is that not concerning at all that yields are as high as they are? And we expect them to come down a bit, but generally stay high. I would look more at overall financial conditions, probably, than just the level of interest rates. And the level of interest rates is still high. That's true at the short end. It's true at the longer end. But in part because risk markets have been quite resilient, our FCI is still pretty accommodative. And that, I think, again, is a reason for why the Fed's in no hurry. We're in an environment where the equity risk premium is quite low, valuations are high. That's supportive for activity. And it also means that even though we still have a forehandle on the funds rate, which is above, basically, all estimates of longer-term nominal R-star neutral rate, could be sustainable for quite a bit longer. We still have a couple of cuts in our baseline for 2025, but we've pushed them to the middle of the year and end of the year. And they might move further because it is quite optional in an environment where the unemployment rate is stable at about 4% and we continue to get growth in the low to mid-2s. There's just no real urgency for the Fed to move, at least until they've gotten a clearer sense of how these policy risks are shaping up. But I think it could be sustainable. I think it's more likely that rates come down over time. Again, that's true at the short end. It's true at the longer end. But much stranger things have happened than these things going sideways for potentially quite a while longer. But a key part of the tailwinds is the consumer. It's held up remarkably well. And you aren't seeing any cracks in the consumer, essentially, at these sort of higher-for-longer rates. No, because the higher-for-longer rates are not... That's not a major rate increase. It's not a negative shock to the consumer. And there's still the tailwind of price inflation having come down a lot more quickly than wage inflation, i.e. real wages increasing. If you combine that with some employment growth, still pretty good employment growth, if you take the average of the last three to six months, still close to $200,000, and some other sources of income growth, we're getting real disposable personal income rising 2.5%. And then your best guess, if you don't have a major change in the drivers of the saving rate, is that consumption also grows by 2.5%. And when I then look at all of the other components of GDP, the 30% of GDP that are not consumption, that sort of balances out, and we've got GDP growth at about 2.5%. It's a less exciting kind of call than it has been at times in the past, because while that's still above consensus, it's only above consensus by a few tenths. And I think it's probably fair to say that many market participants have a somewhat more optimistic view at this point than the Bloomberg consensus. But at the same time, it may not be all that exciting. It's still pretty solid, and it's backdrop for, yeah, maybe continuing to climb the wall of worry. Not exciting, but I think interesting, and that explanation, I think, was quite interesting. Adam, if I kind of turn that question back on to you in the sense that we have 4.5% plus tenure yields. We also have the stronger dollar. At one point, we were worried about equities when we were seeing a higher dollar and such high yields. That's not a concern I'm hearing. Yeah, look, it's less of a concern for us, I think. There are definitely people concerned about that, more concerned than we are. When I step back, I think the mix, it's similar to what Jan said with regards to the economy. Our markets, the notion that there's a level of yields that is unsustainable and that you can define that, I think that is just a very complicated thing to know where yields belong over the medium term, both in terms of our ability to understand where neutral rates belong for the economy, but also in financial markets to understand what the appropriate pricing is. I think, for me, there are two or three things that it's better to ask about in terms of understanding whether they're a problem or not. The first is, what's driving it? Are we mostly pricing higher yields because the growth environment is supporting that, is better, or is there some other problem, some inflation problem that is driving it? We had inflation-driven rises in yields in 22, 23, those were more damaging, but most of the reason we've pushed yields up is because the economy has continued to perform significantly better than people have expected. It's a side effect, in general, of a big growth upgrade that the markets made, and that's sort of more manageable. As long as that stays the kind of driving and motivating force, that's probably manageable. The second thing is, in the end, do you think the Fed is ready to cut rates if there's a real growth problem? Are they constrained in any way? I think for equities, in some ways, you need that more than you need yields to be at a particular level. If you know that the Fed is ready conditionally to support you, that is a source of comfort that put, if you like, exists. I think there are worries about it every time inflation picks up a little, but the basic answer to that still is yes. The third, which reflects those two things, is when I think of longer-dated bonds, is are they getting more protective of equity portfolios? People are going to want to hold those against an equity portfolio, which comes down a bit to what's driving again, but the more we think that the inflation environment is still gently cooling even if it's still above target, and that there are these potential downside risks to growth in which bonds might be protective, the case for having bonds in a portfolio is also something that helps anchor demand for that in a broader sense. I would say those things could be challenged. There are definitely policy outcomes and macro outcomes that could challenge them, but at the moment, I feel like with those questions giving you more generous answers still, I think it's not an unmanageable situation. Jan, I want to end with a broader question, which is also policy-related but in a slightly different way, which is I think you said something to the effect recently that policy changes are making the data murkier. You said this in the context of payrolls, I think, because we are seeing big changes in the population, which could be influencing them. We're also at the same time seeing federal agencies being shrunk and consolidated. So when we think about the data that's available to us to understand what's going on in markets, ultimately are you concerned that the information isn't going to be there or it's not going to be as reliable as in the past? Yeah, I think the payroll numbers have been a bit less meaningful in the last couple of years. That continues. It might get a little bit better again, but it has been less meaningful because prior to the pandemic, we always had a very clear sense of what the break-even rate of payrolls was, and it was, call it, $70,000 a month. So you knew that anything materially above that was a strong report that meant reducing labor market slack and something below that was a weak report. There's been a lot of uncertainty about the break-even rate of payrolls, in part because measuring immigration, especially unauthorized immigration in real time, is very complicated. We think that the break-even rate is about $150,000, but coming down probably fairly steeply, and the range of uncertainty is several tens of thousands at any point in time. So that's been less reliable. I think if we get to a more stable, very low net immigration environment, we'll go back to something in the $50,000 to $100,000 range for break-evens so we can put a bit more weight on payrolls again. I think in the recent past, I would say you should put more weight on the unemployment rate, you should put more weight on employment to population, on U6, on some of these household survey ratios, and that might shift back a little bit. In terms of federal agencies being consolidated and perhaps shrunk and programs being shrunk, that's certainly something to keep an eye on. So far, we haven't seen any data sets disappear that are essential. It's a little bit TBD. I think in general, I would always recommend looking at a broad range of indicators that aim to measure similar things and then averaging them, and in many cases, that gives you a more robust answer because even under normal circumstances, there's a lot of noise in each individual series and you want to try to wash out that noise as much as possible. But it sounds like your job and our jobs could get a little bit more challenging, maybe. There are always new challenges. Jan, Dom, thanks so much for joining us today and continuing the conversation. I look forward to continuing the conversation in the future. Thanks so much. Thank you.

And what could that mean for economies and markets? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by Kamakshia Trivedi, our head of Global Foreign Exchange, Interest Rates and Emerging Markets Strategy Research, Alec Phillips, our chief political economist, and Joseph Briggs, who co-leads the global economics team within Goldman Sachs Research. Joseph and Alec are here with me in New York and Kamakshia is in London. So Alec, as we sit here on Wednesday morning, we have seen an absolute slew of tariff announcements over the past week. They just keep coming. It's been very hard to keep track of. As we sit here today, we are waiting for more details on what could be a reciprocal tariff, and those details might actually be out by the time this podcast sees the light of day. I think it would be useful just to start with, catch us up. What is happening with tariffs at this point? Right. So a lot has happened and a lot more has been announced that hasn't yet happened, starting with Inauguration Day. I think as we went into Inauguration Day, a lot of our clients had an expectation that you were going to have a bunch of big tariff announcements. Instead, on Inauguration Day, we got a memo that had all sorts of recommendations and studies and reports due by April 1st. And what that seemed to suggest is that actually we're going to get a reprieve for a couple of months where maybe we wouldn't have some of those big announcements. And then of course, actually that day, President Trump said, but by the way, Mexico and Canada tariffs starting February 1st. So all of a sudden, that April 1st date looked a little less relevant. He also then proposed the 10% on China, which he seemed to shy away from the first day. But then the second day of the new administration said, no, yes, we're going to do China 10% on February 1st as well. We get to February 1st, obviously we saw what happened. He proposed the tariff formally on all three countries. And then of course, we got the deal. And for Canada and Mexico, those tariffs were pushed off by a month to March 4th. For China, they were implemented. And so that was actually a pretty big change and it happened pretty early. Our expectation going into it had been that we would get China tariffs pretty early and that we would not get any of those other tariffs. So in that sense, it went according to what we were imagining. I will say in the moment, it certainly didn't feel like it was going along with expectations. So that's what we got there. We then saw steel and aluminum tariffs just announced. Those don't take effect for another month, but I don't think that's really a negotiating tactic. I think that's just time to implement and so on. So those seem pretty real. The effect there is smaller. We already had steel and aluminum tariffs from the first administration. They had carved out so many exemptions to those that they didn't have that much of an effect. But now those exemptions all go away. The aluminum tariff goes from 10% to 25%. Not as big of a deal there, but clearly still impactful. And so now we're waiting for the next round of stuff and potential reciprocal tariff announcement coming as soon as today, possible tariffs on the EU, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot more still to come. I want to ask you more about that reciprocal tariff. But before I do, just give us a little context. A lot of us have in our mind the trade war in 2018, 2019 in Trump's first term. So as you're sitting here, how does this compare to that? Is it faster? Is it bigger? How would you contextualize it? Yes, both. Right. In terms of faster, the thing I will point out is that if you look at the rise in the effective tariff rate on imports from China during Trump's first term, so the entire so-called trade war with China, it ended up being around a 10 percentage point increase. And then the other big tariff that we got at that point was on steel and aluminum, which then we had a lot of exemptions to. If you look at what has happened in the last couple of weeks, we got a 10% across the board tariff on imports from China that actually covers more than all of the imports that were covered during the entire first term. And we got steel and aluminum tariffs with no exemptions and a higher tariff rate on aluminum. So you take the entire trade war or whatever you want to call it from the first term, you compress it into two weeks and we just got that. But the amazing thing is that if you then look at the kind of the commentary around this and the media coverage, the market commentary for that matter, the commentary is the trade war was avoided because we didn't do tariffs with Canada and Mexico. So on the one hand, this is actually already a lot more than we saw, or it's, I should say, equivalent to what we saw in the first term. On the other hand, it's as if the bullet has been dodged so far because nothing really serious has happened. But of course, I think everybody is still expecting a lot more to happen. And so you could argue maybe expectations were already just so high for additional tariffs coming in that so far what we've seen doesn't seem that surprising. I'm sure there will be another, and KT may have the other side of this, that maybe there are some places where expectations aren't that high and that not that much has been priced. But certainly from sort of the media and public perspective, it seems like people are already conditioned to expect a lot of tariff announcements. But Kanak Chia, would you agree with that when you think about the market reaction so far? Have you been surprised or are there places where you think this is being priced more or less? Yeah, I think it's fair to say that when you look at it on a broad basis, you take the currency markets, for example, which are the place where you should see the impact most directly because currencies can offset the tariff impact to some extent by shifting relative prices. You did see when Canada and Mexico tariffs were imminent, the broad dollar moved up a percent and a half. So to the question that we often get, are all the tariffs already priced? Is it all already reflected in market pricing? The short answer to that is no. You can see that the dollar did strengthen a percent and a half. You did see the euro weaken. You did see equities fall and the bond curve flatten as well. But it is true that there were places where perhaps a lot more was expected. Like Alec mentioned, a good example is China. China was a place where I think we and a lot of others expected much more significant tariffs. And the 10% was seen as a little bit of a smaller increase than people were expecting. And so Chinese markets, in fact, started moving up already. I think there's also another layer here. I think that the back and forth that you have seen a little bit that Alec described has also meant that people are unwilling to price the full impact straight away when the announcement happens or when the tariffs go into effect. And so what that tells you is that the longer they stay in place, the more likely it is that the market impact will build over time. It might also be that the retaliatory impacts become bigger. So for example, in China's case, the retaliation has been seen as somewhat more constrained. They haven't allowed the currency to move that much. Their retaliatory measures are less than proportionate. But the longer they stay in place on China, if you get that second additional 10% as well, you might see a bigger response. So from both those senses, you might get a bigger impact the longer they stay in place. And Alec, I think the big question on a lot of people's mind is whether this reciprocal tariff is really going to be the big tariff. There's been so much discussion about a universal tariff. Do you think that this replaces a universal tariff? Or do you think there's still a chance that we get a very extreme scenario like that? Yeah, I mean, that is, in theory, the silver lining of the reciprocal tariff. Now I will say, Trump talked about something called the Reciprocal Trade Act, which is essentially a legislative version of the reciprocal tariff during his first term. And if you look at the way he described the reciprocal tariff last week, he actually said, I'm going in this direction instead of an across-the-board tariff. I'm paraphrasing, but that was essentially what he meant. I think the question though is, four weeks into the new term, is this really the final step on tariff policy? And do we then not see any further tariff announcements? I think most people would say probably not. And so it could be that for now, this is a replacement for the across-the-board tariff, but it doesn't mean that we won't still see additional discussion of that. And I don't think it means that risk is off the table. In terms of our expectations, we have always assumed that the across-the-board tariff was a clear risk, but not the baseline. And I'd say even with a reciprocal tariff, I think that would probably still be our assumption, just because there's a long way to go here. And we haven't even gotten to the big question around tariffs, which is this fiscal idea. So it's not just about negotiation or about protecting certain industries. It might also be about generating revenue. And that, I think right now, is still very much an open question. But if it turns out that Congress is looking for a lot more budgetary savings because they've got this big fiscal package, and Trump is worried about trying to deal with all of that, then we could see the focus shift back to that sort of universal tariff or other tariff ideas. And then outside of the universal tariff, the other clear risk is this idea of critical imports or, you know, big sectoral tariffs on different things. And Trump has mentioned that now several times. And I think something on that is probably coming. KS. Interesting. Yes, there is a lot of uncertainty. We recognize that. If we take all of the different tariffs that have been announced and you think are likely to be implemented, and your best guess on this reciprocal tariff, ultimately, that can go in a lot of ways as well, what would be the net effect on the effective tariff rate? What do your numbers show? JS. If you take everything that we've sort of imagined in our baseline, so you've got China-focused tariffs, the ones that were already announced and implemented, plus another 10 points on top of that, which we think probably at some point does come, so-called critical imports, the steel and aluminum, etc., you end up having something like a four-point increase in the effective tariff rate. If you add the reciprocal tariff on top of that, and this depends a lot on how they actually implement this and structure it, but you've got another point or two on top of it. The risk scenario on the reciprocal tariff is that Trump has talked a lot about value-added taxes over the years. And in particular, he has focused on the fact that the EU has more than a 20% in most countries value-added tax. And if they ended up including that in the calculation, then you would have a much bigger tariff increase. That would be something like another 10 points. So actually, in many ways, similar to the across-the-board tariff in terms of the impact. Right now, we're talking about mid-single digits in terms of the increase in the effective tariff rate. But obviously, the risk scenario is toward the higher end of that. CM JS, let me bring you into the conversation. If we get this mid-single-digit increase in the effective tariff rate, what would be the implications for growth? And it will differ between the economies at stake. Talk us through some of the economic implications of some of these higher tariffs. Yeah, absolutely. I'd say that when I look at the baseline scenario that Alec outlined and reasonable perturbations around it, I would characterize the impact as manageable. On the growth side of things, tariffs impact the economy in several different ways, tighter financial conditions and increased uncertainty can slow investment. Higher prices can slow real income growth, thereby creating headwinds to consumer spending. And you do see the net trade effects where a lower import demand from the U.S. tends to boost GDP in the U.S., but weigh on activity elsewhere. Under the roughly five percentage point increase in the tariff rate baseline, we would expect that growth in the U.S. would probably slow by a quarter point or so. We've been somewhat hesitant to incorporate this drag into our forecast, mostly because we haven't seen financial conditions tighten that much in response to tariff announcements so far. And furthermore, some of the more pro-growth parts of Trump's agenda should provide offsets that leave the net impact on GDP somewhat neutral. We do expect bigger headwinds in China. They have been the target of most of the hawkish trade news recently. We have seen 10 percentage point tariffs already implemented. As Alec mentioned, we're expecting another 10 percentage points. And under that scenario, we expect that growth this year will probably be about 70 basis points lower than it would have been otherwise. For other economies, there's not really a big direct growth impact. Most of the impact is going to come from this trade policy uncertainty channel. The idea here is that if you're a German exporter and you're seeing growth slow in China and you're worried about tariffs on the E.U., then you're probably not going to be scaling up hiring or undertaking large capital investments until you have clarity around the business environment that you're going to be operating in. And so during the last trade war, we saw that this type of dynamic slowed growth in the euro area probably by about a point. We expect that a similar dynamic is going to play out this time. It's a reason why the day after Trump's election, we took down our European growth forecast by half a point and are still forecasting a well below consensus base of growth of 0.7% in the euro area this year. And so this is going to be the main channel that has bite in other economies. The last point to make is that the critical goods imports will have some impacts on companies or countries that are highly exposed to them, namely economies like Canada. But again, the direct impact, from my perspective, looks pretty small right now. The focus really seems to be on inflation and whether these tariffs are going to make the problematic inflation even worse. What are you finding in terms of inflation impacts of the tariffs that we think are most likely and a more extreme scenario that Alec laid out? Tariffs definitely have a direct impact on inflation. Higher import costs are ultimately largely going to be passed on to the consumers. That's why we have taken our core PC inflation forecast in the U.S. up to 2.6% by the end of this year, despite the fact that if we didn't have tariffs, we'd probably be expecting the core inflation converges back towards target, maybe a touch above at 2.1%. And so there will be a moderate uplift to prices in the U.S. In other economies, the two things to watch are how countries retaliate and then how currencies move. I'm sure KT will have a lot more to say on currency impacts later on, but so far we haven't seen a lot of very aggressive retaliation announcements. Other economies have been somewhat hesitant to match dollar for dollar. Retaliation has been targeted to specific strategic goods. And so if we remain in this scenario where we're not actually seeing imports or tariffs on imports to other countries from the U.S., then you're not seeing the large direct price increases and the impact on inflation will largely be driven by currency depreciation. I actually see a case where tariffs could be net disinflationary in other economies, mostly because we do expect a moderate slowdown in growth. And at the same time, if we do see some of the Chinese export supply being reallocated to other major economies because of the pullback in U.S. demand, then this could be worth a few tenths of downward pressure on core inflation in places like the euro area. Interesting. If you're sitting here at the Fed and you have potential growth impacts and potential inflation impacts, how are they weighing this and what do we expect from here, from the Fed, given this uncertainty? I think the tariffs are a reason why the Fed will be cautious. And this has been definitely reflected in the recent rhetoric we've heard most recently from Chair Powell yesterday. Our baseline forecast is still for two cuts this year, one more cut in 2026. That being said, if we do see tariffs drive prices too much higher above our current forecast for 2.6% core P.C. inflation, then the Fed will become a little bit concerned about inflation spilling back into inflation expectations, wage growth, and as a result, I think it does strengthen the case for the Fed remaining on hold for longer, especially since growth in the U.S. continues to run at a very healthy pace, and we're expecting that this will continue despite tariffs. So to summarize, it is slightly hawkish for the Fed, but if we're only seeing core inflation rise to 2.6% and underlying inflation is cooling, I do think that the Fed will be able to cut this year. For other economies, the impact, I think, is more clearly to us. You're not getting much of an inflation impact and there should be a growth drag. This should definitely strengthen the case for cuts in other economies, particularly major exporters like the Euro area and Canada. And Kamakshi, just going back to you, is that what you're seeing reflected in market pricing at this point? Yeah. If you go back to the weekend around when Canada and Mexico tariffs looked imminent, it wasn't just that the dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar or against the Mexican peso. The Euro fell quite meaningfully as well, and I think it partly fell for some of the reasons that Joseph was just describing. The idea that, A, there's likely to be more tariffs to come, so it was taken as a signal that the Euro area could be up next, but that even if the Euro area is not a direct target of upcoming tariffs, the increase in trade uncertainty, the fact that it's disinflationary for the Euro area, and the fact that there's limited space in the Euro area to respond from a fiscal standpoint meant that interest rates might come down even more in the Euro area relative to other parts of the world. And so that rate differential between the US and the Euro area widens in that eventuality. It stays wide, and that again puts more downward pressure on the Euro itself. So that's certainly something we saw even when Europe was not directly the target of tariffs around that weekend. But as we've been hearing from Alec, we think there's more news to come. So while I don't think all of this is priced, and you see that in the kind of back and forth that you're seeing in the announcements and the back and forth that you are seeing in currency markets, we think there's more coming, and this is still an early act in display. And as we go further, we will see more of these impacts being priced, but certainly the early acts give us an indication of which direction that is going on. And how are investors, well, how are you observing investors responding to all of this uncertainty at this point? Are you seeing hedges or less activity, or it's just business as usual until we get more information? I think there's a few different things. I mean, it's fair to say, yes, I mean, there's already a little bit of investor fatigue from all the tariff headline ping pong that has been going on. I'd highlight three things. You know, first, I think some investors, I think, are trying to be super nimble, super responsive, have short-dated exposures, add them when the market relaxes about some of these risks, so things like dollar upside, buying volatility. But the challenge with those exposures is that you have to monetize them and reload them very quickly. And being super nimble is easier said than done. I think the other strategy that you're seeing a lot of people revert to is to acknowledge that, look, predicting these events and these announcements and when exactly they happen is hard. And by the way, even in 2018-19, we saw the biggest market impacts just when those announcements did happen. And so if you don't have an edge exactly on when this is coming out, it's hard to be too positioned for that. And so you anchor your market views to your broader distribution of outcomes. Our broader view, as Joseph outlined, is still a pretty benign one. We expect solid growth. We expect inflation to be declining. And so people are positioning for long equity views, but having hedges, like you mentioned, particularly for dollar upside against things like the euro, things like the CAD, because in the event that you get that deep tariff tail, we think there's a lot more that those things can move. So certainly pairing any sort of long risk position, long equity position with dollar upside, I think is a key part of managing the portfolio. I think the other thing you're also seeing is people diversifying their equity exposures more. Now, diversification is always a good thing, but it might particularly help in this case because if some of the worst tariff tails, the risks that Alec mentioned, are avoided, that's going to be good for equities, but it might be more good for equities outside the US where some of these risks are beginning to be priced in euro area, China, where valuations are also a little bit more compelling. And then I think the final thing people are doing is basically just staying away, like trying to find areas of the market and the macro universe that are not affected by the day-to-day tariff headlines. We're seeing people more engaged in places like Japan and Japanese fixed income where they're getting more convinced about the fact that policy rates can move higher for longer using more EM carry strategies in places where there is more room for managed currencies to deliver you a sort of income stream that is not related to the day-to-day wall in tariff headlines. So I think those are some of the strategies people are using. Alec, let's close with you. Obviously, we've talked about the fact that there is still tremendous uncertainty. What are you watching? Are there key dates, key announcements? What are you watching in the coming weeks? I think there's basically going to be something just about every week. I think I'm right in saying we've had some discussion between President Trump and the press more or less every day since inauguration. And more of those days than not, I think, have included some tariff discussion. So there's going to be a lot of news. I think the things from here, so obviously, reciprocal tariff and what we see on that in the very near term, I think there is a clear risk that at some point fairly soon could be next week, could be the next few weeks. We see some kind of announcement on an EU-focused tariff. Trump has said that in the next four weeks, he will make an announcement on some of the sectoral tariffs. And then, of course, we have this April 1st deadline in the original trade memo where you're going to have a lot of recommendations from the Treasury, from the US Trade Representative, from the Department of Commerce on all kinds of different trade issues, including how to structure a universal tariff, what else to do with regard to China, the phase one trade deal, whether there are new tariffs that should be announced there. So for as much as right now, it feels like there's a lot going on. I think the stuff that we're seeing right now is still more in the negotiation leverage phase of it. We're kind of getting into what I would think of as the second phase, which is the sort of more protecting domestic industries focused on certain products, etc. And then the big question is, do we get into what I think would be the final phase, which is, you know, using tariffs for revenue, broader economic adjustment, etc. We've always assumed we would have those first two phases. The question is whether we get to that final one. And I think April 1st, we'll probably find out more around that. So basically, we'll be sitting on the edge of our seat every single day as this unfolds. That's right. And not just on trade, because don't forget, we've got a lot of other issues to worry about to fiscal, immigration, regulatory, etc. So there's a lot going on. Absolutely. Alec, Joseph, and Kamakshia, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks. Thank you, Alison. Thank you. This episode was recorded on Wednesday, February 12th, 2025. I'm Alison Nathan. Thanks for listening.

I'm Alison Nathan. This year, we've decided to look closer at the rise of AI and everything it could mean for companies, investors, and economies. So we're bringing you this series of special podcast episodes we're calling AI Exchanges, which I'll be hosting alongside my colleague, George Lee. George is the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. He's the former CIO of Goldman Sachs. And before that, he was co-chairman of the Global Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Group in our investment banking business. George, thanks for joining me for this series. Thank you, Alison. It's great to be doing this with you. Look forward to it. I am super excited about this. The goal here is to help listeners understand the impacts that AI is having today and the ways it could change in the years ahead, the implications, as I just said, for businesses and economies. And George, there's really no better time to be having this conversation because, of course, we've recently seen some really fundamental questions about the AI build-out ripple throughout the markets quite powerfully. We all have observed the volatility we've seen in the markets this week. It's been well-reported that a China-based AI company called DeepSeek has rolled out a low-cost AI tool, which is raising questions about AI infrastructure and about the massive spending on AI by America's biggest tech companies. George, this is right up your alley. You've been having a pretty active debate with Jim Covello, global head of equity research at Goldman Sachs, about whether the benefits of AI will justify what was expected to be an enormous cost from these companies in terms of developing and supporting the technology. And that spending is well underway, as we all know. And you've been on the bullish side of that debate. How does the emergence of this low-cost competitor shift that discussion? I'm just going to ask you, does it mean that Jim was right to be skeptical about the huge CapEx spend all along? First of all, Alison, it has been great to have this running discussion with Jim. And it's in such a momentous and dynamic time, as you've discussed, so it makes for really fruitful and interesting dialogue. I would say, though, that to your point precisely, I would say much to the contrary. I think this answers some of Jim's principal concerns, not all of them, but some of them. Two of his understandable and well-founded concerns were the eye-watering capital costs of building this pre-training infrastructure, which you referenced, and then his belief that the technology would never really get cheap enough to have broad utility inside the enterprise. And so this development, which may, I would underscore may, promise much more efficient ways of pre-training, may indeed, deep into the future, reduce the amount of capital we have to allocate to at least that part of this ecosystem. And further, DeepSeek's pricing measures suggest that we will continue to see very steep declines in per-token costs that make the incremental cost of an intelligent token trend towards marginal zero, which is a very powerful concept. But the question is, lots of companies have been spending lots of money. Do you think that spending is essentially not going to be useful spending? Oh, no. Again, to the contrary. First of all, this doesn't mark the end, and perhaps it marks the beginning of even more pre-training activity by more people who can afford to embark on this at lower capital cost. And so people talk about Jevons paradox as the price of something declines, abundance tends to increase. Moreover, I think one important part of this debate is DeepSeek has performed some really interesting engineering hacks to address pre-training costs. These models have already shifted towards much more dense and abundant computing at inference time, at test time. And so that itself, if the price of intelligent tokens decline, it breeds abundant new use cases. And a lot of the computation is at inference. I think all the infrastructure that we've sunk capital into now and in the next few years that are planned will be well used. One could ask questions as you look farther out the horizon, years three, five, seven, whether we'll need the same trajectory of capital cost, but that just comes down to a judgment on this idea of, hey, you've got a less expensive commodity. Will that breed more volumes that offset that price decline? And so the history of technology would tell you that indeed that will be the dynamic. But again, I think this marks a really interesting advance in the technology. It addresses many of the concerns market observers like Jim have had and promises the abundance of these tokens that for places like Goldman Sachs will open up new horizons of use cases. Right. And more cost-effective use cases. And essentially could we see the applications and the adoption of them speed up? Absolutely. And Jim cites in our dialogue a few applications where the technology is useful for us, and yet it remains prohibitively expensive relative to human capital. And this actually I think changes that equation. And again, this will embrace new use cases we can't even really imagine today, which will be fun and interesting. And again, this is part of a repeated history of the way that technology happens. This feels like a very discontinuous moment because the sharpness of the decline in potential capital costs and token costs. But if you scope back out and you view it in the history of Moore's Law over the last 120 years, even spanning outside the Silicon Age or this phenomenon in general, I think it's a measurable but small blip in a steeply declining overall curve. That's really interesting. Let's bring Kim Posnett into this conversation. Kim is the Global Co-Head of Investment Banking in our Global Banking and Markets Business and the former Global Head of the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Group. Kim, welcome to the discussion. I can't think of a better guest. Thank you for having me, guys. Do you think about this phenomenon the same way? Alison and I just had a fun discussion about the trade-off between price and volume and Jevin's paradox. Do you see it the same way and are your clients thinking about it the same way? I do, not surprisingly, George. If you put aside the global race for AI supremacy, that's a separate conversation. I think there's, and you and I talked about this over the past few days and weeks, this unambiguously good news. The cost of compute is coming down dramatically. The price per token is coming down dramatically. That means these models are becoming more cost efficient. It is great for the world that this will be cheaper for all of us, point one. And Jevin's paradox, you mentioned, I think that is absolutely in play where you see increased efficiency that will lead to increased adoption and consumption. And there's so many examples across the business landscape where you can see expanded use cases. We've all been talking about automating repetitive tasks, but imagine automating complex processes. So legal assistance, financial services, scientific research. I was just with an AI researcher last week talking about modeling the immune system and modeling the brain. Think about the implications for the healthcare industry if we're able to achieve that. As an example, my favorite example, I think this, I want to know what yours is too, is ubiquitous conversational AI. So sort of like personal assistants for everyone in every context, personally, professionally. I do think you'll see that there's so many more use cases we could go into, but those are some examples. I agree. I think the conversational interface is very powerful and requires a shift in some ways in how you use the technology. And I find myself with my AirPods walking down the street, talking to voice assistants and looking a little peculiar in the process, but it's a very powerful modality to get access to that intelligence for sure. Also a parallel phenomenon that people are talking about, this got drowned out for just a minute by this whole DeepSeek episode is the rise of agents and some of the new approaches there. What do you think about that? Are we early in that? Is that a whole new vector of improvement for these models? I think we are early days and AI agents, I believe also that they will be ubiquitous over time. Who knows what the timeframe is? You tell me, I think you agree. I do. And I've spent the past weekend playing with cloud computer use and the new operator product from OpenAI. And it's very early. It's sort of a proto experience, but it hints at something that's very powerful. Sorry, can I just ask, when we say AI agents, for people who are not that close to AI, what are we talking about? First of all, I'm so glad you asked that question because it's a very broad set of definitions around agents. I'll give you two, one broader, which is a system of models, computation and resources that complete linked tasks and allow you to complete more multi-step complex tasks in business or personal life. So the canonical example is I want to take a trip to Phoenix, help me book the flight, help me book a hotel, help me book a rental car, and it's autonomously executed. The applications that we're talking about are more, for now, more consumer oriented and basically give the instructions to these applications to resupply something that you need for your house from Amazon. And it brings up a webpage. It takes a picture of the webpage. It's able to discern those pixels, identify text entry boxes, buttons. It takes a hold of your cursor and begins to execute on your behalf. And it's really extraordinary to watch. It is early and by the admission of the people who are developing these capabilities, and they want to enroll people in refining it. One market observer, though, had a very funny characterization of it, which is you ask it for a task. It brings up a browser. It starts executing on your behalf in websites. And it's so slow and deliberate and herky-jerky while it's doing it. It reminds you of teaching your grandparents how to use the web in 1997. But nonetheless, an inspiring direction of travel for the technology. I think it's an important question because you've got this sort of near vertical advancement of these AI models. This is an example of that, which is driving this increased demand for, and you mentioned this earlier, Alison, scalability, efficiency, sustainability. And the increased scale and complexity of these AI models today require huge amounts of capital. Equally, they require huge amounts of energy, powered land, and data centers. And that leads to your question around CapEx spend. It's why I agree with George's answer on the CapEx spend today. Was that for naught? I don't think so. I'll give you a data point, which is fascinating. If you look at the CapEx spend of, and I'll just pick four companies, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft. Across the four of them, they spent over $116 billion of CapEx in 2022. That was the year that GPT was launched to the public. Roll forward two years later, 2024, they spent just under $200 billion. That's almost double in a two-year timeframe. And you've seen the recent announcements. Meta has announced that they'll spend $60 to $65 billion on AI-related CapEx spend this year. Microsoft, $80 billion. You saw the announcement, the Stargate AI infrastructure JV announcement just last week. So there's, I think, a huge amount of CapEx spend that is appropriate right now, given this near vertical advancements. And I agree with George. The question is, in three, four or five years, as these models become more efficient, it's unclear what the CapEx requirements will be in the medium term. But we are hearing very low CapEx spend for this low-cost Chinese-based competitor. So are companies actually rethinking the amount of dollars that will need to go towards this technology? Over the medium and long term, perhaps. And I think it relates directly to what we see on the efficiency curve of these models. And I don't think we know the answer yet. I agree with that. So, Kim, one of the other predicates, one of the ingredients you pour into the top of these models to create this intelligence, in addition to power and data center capacity that you cited, is data itself. And in your career as a banker, you've done a lot of very data-centric transactions. You know that ecosystem well. Observers say that we're running out of human-generated, broadly available data very quickly, if not already. So that sets the mind, I think, of model-makers towards synthetic data generation or unlocking data that's behind firewalls or protected and proprietary. Is there any chance this sort of economy of data emerges around that? Yes, I think so. And my view on this has evolved over the past few years. What is the single greatest bottleneck to AI? Is it data or is it power? I think maybe a year ago, I would have said data. I think today I would say power. So anyway, we can debate that. But I do think that the landscape of data economies is emerging and evolving. So there's new data marketplaces, as George alludes to, but there's also the reshaping of existing markets. And so last year, you started to see new creative partnerships form and data licensing deals. So that was publisher partnerships, that was social media partnerships, that was stock photography partnerships. And I think you'll continue to see that because data has become so valuable. And then on whether we've run out of data, I think you'll start to see things like synthetic data marketplaces. So that's where AI generated data mimics real time data. Think like your medical records. And you use that synthetic data to train models or personal data marketplaces where you can opt in and sell your own personal data to a business to train a model. It's a great segue to deal making and what you're seeing in Silicon Valley and around the world in capital formation and new companies and potential for IPOs and sales. There's a whole set of fellow travelers alongside these model providers and infrastructure providers that give infrastructure and tooling and security. Are you seeing the emergence of a lot of those companies and are they growing faster than prior generations that you and I might have worked with over the years? Yeah. So if you talk to CEOs, and I'll just focus on the US, across the US corporate landscape, I think many would say over the past few years, they felt headwinds to growth from a monetary policy standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint. And if you ask them today what their perspectives are, I think there's a general tone of optimism and a belief that the monetary policy and regulatory environment will ease, which will allow them to be more forward leaning on growth, on investment, on M&A, on IPOs, etc. So I think that the backdrop to deal making, especially in tech, is quite constructive today. In the early days of this year, it's only been three or four weeks, you've seen a lot of strategic activity. I expect that strategic activity to continue and accelerate throughout the year. As it relates to AI specifically, I think of AI deal making through sort of two lenses. One is capital markets and financing and the other one is M&A. And on capital markets and financing, we've already touched on a lot of the thematics that investors are focused on, which is CapEx spend, ROI, global supremacy, who will win, who will lose. I do think generally investors are bullish still on AI. There's emerging questions as last week proved. And then on M&A, I actually think you've seen already AI driven strategic M&A. There's a bunch of examples from last year. So I think you'll see more strategic M&A specifically related to AI this coming year. And Kim, you briefly mentioned power as a constraint as well. So talk to us about what you've been learning about that and why you're more concerned. As I said, I've debated in my mind, what's the bigger constraint, data or power? I now think it's... Do you agree with me that it's power? My answer to whether it's data or power would be yes. Okay, thank you. And I'm not sure how to balance them. That's quite clarifying. Thank you. But historically, we've seen decades, literally decades of sub 3% annual growth in baseload power demand in the US as an example. And now you're seeing this unprecedented tectonic shift in demand for power related to AI. And just to dimensionalize that a little bit, AI servers require, I don't know, 10x the amount of power as a traditional server order of magnitude. And you're seeing these companies, the hyperscalers build these AI data center campuses that are multi gigawatt centers, okay? Just to put it in context, that's what it takes to power entire cities. And so I just think we can't underestimate the amount of power needed to run these highly complicated and complex AI systems today. Data will likely be a source. I mean, one of the interesting parts about that is it in of itself will be part of a demand function for innovation and power delivery. And so scaling green sources, battery that allows you to store and use that in a less intermittent way, small modular nuclear fusion, it's, I think it's again, it's innovation in an industry that's been relatively static spawned by this demand. Okay, maybe let's end with something that you and I talk a lot about, which is we focused on the steep improvements in this technology, the potential for it to be more broadly useful at lower cost in the world. And yet we see a little bit of a lag of enterprise adoption. And I am hopeful this is a year where we're going to see that inflect upwards. What are you hearing from clients? What are you observing? And then maybe last, do you have any interesting personal use cases of it that you'd like to share? Oh my gosh, I use it all the time. Yeah, I think that last year people were still testing and learning and trying to understand applications to their own businesses. And I think this year is the year of true enterprise adoption and scaling. And so I think this will be important year to see how much enterprise adoption there is across AI and love to hear your views. And yeah, I just think that there's so many examples I could use both personally and professionally about how I integrate AI into my life. I don't even know where to begin, but I, like you, I'm walking down the street talking to my AI, like my imaginary friend. It's funny because we laugh about it and yet you have to recognize it was only two years ago that this capability was loosed upon the earth in the form of the initial launch of chat GPT. And we worry about the lag in enterprise adoption. We wrestle with the amount of capital and the costs associated with this. And yet you look around and there's a generational dimension of this too, where you look around and people joining the workforce or in schools, the way that they fluidly use this technology and are just perhaps in small quanta to begin with, but a wedge opening up of more productive, but a little bit smarter, a little bit more responsive. And so I think it's, again, it's just a glimmer of where this will take us hopefully in the enterprise and in our personal lives. And can you telegraph anything to come around Goldman and enterprise adoption around AI? Sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's in the news, we launched our GS AI assistant, which allows more people across the firm to get access to leading edge models, to be able to use them in a safer, more reliable, and more compliant way, which befitting our roles as a regulated financial institution is important. And again, early days, AI is in many ways prolific throughout the firm, but this is the broadest, most general purpose offering we've made. And I think it will be really interesting to see in the coming months, what use cases emerge, what innovations, what creativity is brought to bear, particularly by our junior people. Yep. George, Kim, this has been a fascinating conversation. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you for having me guys. Kim, great to kick this series off with you. Couldn't imagine a better guest. Super fun. Thank you. Thank you. And George, if I take away anything from this conversation, it's that there is a lot of good news in these recent developments, even if the market's been very volatile around them. And we've said this for a long time now, we are in the early stages of this. So there will be many more evolutions to come. Agree with you. Obviously, as you noted at the beginning, I do have a bullish take on this, but lest I be accused of being a perpetual bull, I think this is in some ways a source of optimism for the future trajectory of the technology. It also poses some questions about the fundamental economics for various participants. As Kim said, it raises questions about longer term capital spend and how companies and infrastructure builders think about it. But I think for the near term, this is pretty much good news and it's part and parcel of fast scaling of an innovative technology and be incredibly fun to watch. Well, George, this has been fun. I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation in future episodes. Great. Thank you. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Wednesday, January 29th. Thanks for listening.

So where are the risks and the opportunities in this environment? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm again sitting down with a very special guest, David Solomon, the Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. We'll talk about his views on economic growth and markets, the firm's strategic priorities, and what he's most focused on in the year ahead. David, welcome back to the program. Thank you. Glad to be here with you. So, David, we have had this annual conversation for several years running now, but I must say this seems like a particularly interesting time to be the CEO of Goldman Sachs. There are what looks to be a lot of tailwinds to the economy and markets, and substantial optimism, of course, with the new Trump administration coming in, and there seems to be a lot of optimism that he's going to usher in a friendlier environment for businesses. But the unknowns also seem unusually large. So let me first ask how you would characterize this business environment. Well, I think you did a pretty good job characterizing this business environment. It's going to be more constructive than it has been the last few years, particularly on the regulatory front, but there are a range of significant policy areas where this administration is ushering in change. And whenever you have change, that creates uncertainty. And so until we have a clear view of the policy trajectory, I think that it's a moment to take stock of where we are. It's great that there are clearly some tailwinds. There's obviously a lot of optimism, but at the same point, the ultimate implementation of the different policy focuses will be important. And so we have to step back and realize people are obviously very focused on immigration policy, and when you look at the executive orders that have come out so far, that's where the primary focus has been. That can have an impact on labor supply, which ultimately can filter through into the economy. I'm not saying it will, but that's something to watch. People have been very focused on trade. We still don't have answers, but at the moment, the market's perception is that the direction of travel on trade will be more as a tool of negotiation in the short term than the breadth of tariffs that have been talked about. You have tax policy, which is obviously important. You have energy policy, which is also important. These are big, complicated areas that the combination of the policy implementation will have an implication for growth. But as I talk to CEOs, CEOs are optimistic because the regulatory burden and the former administration's approach to the business community was quite impactful, and people are excited about the fact that it feels like there's going to be more collaboration toward driving investment and therefore driving growth. It will be a more growth-oriented agenda. Let me just follow up on some of those comments you made about the macro environment, because as you said, some of these policies may create inflation. There are concerns about that when it comes to tariffs, when it comes to the immigration policy you mentioned. We've obviously already seen a lot of volatility in the bond markets. You're to date, I think, volatility that no one really expected, at least the extent of which I mean they're down today, but generally have been quite volatile. What are you thinking in terms of the trajectory of inflation and interest rates from here? Are you concerned at all that both or either could dent the outlook for markets? Well, significant changes in rates and more importantly, a change in the expectation on rates can have an impact on markets. I've been cautious around this topic, particularly around inflation. There's no question that durable goods have been soft in terms of the inflation rate around durable goods, but services and now food, big headwinds. Those things ultimately matter and filter through into the economy. I think that we will see the Fed take no action at this meeting. As you look out through 2025, I think the range of outcomes is a pretty narrow position on policy. Unless we get some policy action that really changes the trajectory of inflation, I think we'll be in a narrow band with the policy rate. We could see some cuts. We might not, but that's my base case assumption. You've got to watch this closely. I think you should take it meeting to meeting and evaluate the data as we go, but going back to where we were in the previous question, if some of these policy implications and discussions get put in place in a way that is more inflationary, that will change the trajectory of this discussion around rates. There's a lot of enthusiasm though about capital markets activity. What are you seeing from your seat? Capital markets activity has run really below trend for the last few years. We had an extraordinary period obviously in 2020 and 2021. A lot of things got pulled forward and then we had a rebalancing in 2022 and that brought capital markets activity and M&A activity for that matter meaningfully below 10-year averages. With the change in the regulatory environment and the business environment, confidence has improved and that confidence generally opens up the capital markets a little bit more. I think there are a couple of things that are clearly obvious. Less M&A activity hampers capital markets activity. Secondarily, the financial sponsors, the private equity firms have really been on the sidelines. We're hearing more and more and seeing more indications of them pulling stuff forward now. So I think there's going to be a meaningfully improved environment of capital markets activity in 2025. It improved in 2024, but it still ran below 10-year averages. We'll get back to 10-year averages or better in 2025 and we'll see how the year plays out. We've talked a little bit about the macro risks, but of course geopolitical risks are always front and center as we enter Trump 2.0, certainly still front and center. How is the firm navigating that risk and how are clients thinking about geopolitical risk at this point? Well, there are three principal geopolitical hotspots. The bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China being one, the situation in Ukraine being a second and the situation in the Middle East being a third. All of these have the potential to create more volatility in markets. But at the same point, I think the market's view is that there will be more progress made. Certainly on our relationship with China under this administration, I think the president is looking to kind of restrike the balance in that relationship and I'm hopeful that he will make some progress. It would be very good for the U.S., it would be very good for the world, and it would be very, very good and well-received for markets. In the Middle East, I think the president views that as an opportunity to continue some of the work he did in his first administration. Obviously, given where we are right now, there's some progress in stabilizing that region, but my hope would be that more progress could be made around a longer-term solution, normalization around relationships, and more stability with respect to the region broadly, and so that's something certainly to watch. A resolution in Ukraine is much more complicated, and so I think it'll be interesting to see whether or not progress can be made, but that, to me, seems to be the one that's a little bit tougher to see an obvious path towards a resolution of progress. All these things create risk. All these things, if they go the wrong way, can upset markets. But for the moment, I think there's a lot of focus on these three hotspots and it'll be interesting to see how the new administration tries to move these forward. How are you viewing growth in economies outside of the U.S., many of which seem to be in the crosshairs of potential shifts in U.S. policy and the geopolitical risks you just mentioned? Global growth has been okay, but it's really been driven by better growth in the U.S. and weaker performance across Europe and China. Those things make up a significant portion of global economic activity. For all the optimism with respect to the U.S., I think there is much more caution and pessimism with respect to Europe and a real questioning of whether or not the nations in the European Union feel enough pressure at this point to finally act on some of the policy things they need to act on to strengthen the European Union as an economic competitor more broadly. I think that's a big question. I was just in Davos and there was a lot of discussion on this topic. I think people would like to be optimistic that there's been enough pressure and underperformance on a relative basis of the European economic system that there will be more aggressive policy action to try to improve growth. My own view is until the nations of Europe start thinking about really trying to create national champions and really think about how they make Europe a better economic competitor, it's hard to see that movement. We need the Netherlands to work with France as opposed to compete with France. Ultimately, if you can't drive national champions across Europe and really create the power of the economic union in Europe, the relative growth trajectory will be lower. That's kind of what we see based on the policy implementation of the last 10 to 20 years. Let's shift gears and dig into some developments in finance in the coming years. You've already mentioned the regulatory landscape near and dear to our hearts. What are you expecting for financial regulatory shifts in 2025? People are policy and one of the most important things to watch here as we go into the new administration is we obviously have a new head coming into the SEC, but there are some important positions that affect the regulatory environment for the financial system, the vice chair of supervision for the Fed, the head of the OCC, the head of the CFTC, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB. All of those appointments are important and I think it's very important that the administration moves forward and gets people into these jobs so that the policy discussion around the regulatory environment for the financial system can move forward. I hope and expect that they will. Once they do, I think the industry will continue to be very engaged to try to create a little bit more balance around the regulatory environment to try to free up capital that can be reinvested in the system. One of the things that's going on in the large financial institutions is there's been uncertainty around CCAR because there's litigation now around CCAR, the stress testing. There's been uncertainty around Basel III. There's uncertainty around G-SIB. That's leaving all the large banks to hold extra large buffers of capital. We want to get policy in place so we know and can plan around capital and that excess capital that's being held because of the uncertainty can be released into the system. That drives more investment, loans, growth, et cetera. I'm hopeful that people will get appointed quickly, that dialogue can continue, and we'll see a clear understanding, clear transparency around some of the principal regulatory areas that I think are important to keep the economy moving forward. Let's dig into another big trend in the broader industry, which is that growth in private credit. How is Goldman Sachs navigating that growth, and how is it navigating it for its clients? Sure. Goldman Sachs has been the private credit business for a long time. We started in the private credit business 30 years ago in the 1990s, and we manage $140 billion of private credit for our clients. But I think what's interesting about Goldman Sachs is we sit at the center of the ecosystem between public markets and private markets. We have an enormous origination engine, and while there's a lot of capital in the world to manage in the private credit space, the real value add to the private credit deployers is origination, interesting investment opportunities. I think we sit in a very interesting place in the middle of that ecosystem. We have the ability to distribute credit and interesting investment opportunities to our clients through the typical originate and syndicate process. We have the ability to originate and use our balance sheet. We have the ability to originate and direct to our asset management franchise. The formation of our capital solutions business that we put forward is a way for us to take some of the advantages we have as a firm sitting in the middle of this ecosystem. I think you're going to see good secular growth in private credit lending. We're certainly in a very, very interesting position to participate in that, both for our investing clients and for our trading or markets clients. We have an incredible set of corporate relationships, really unprecedented, to drive origination of product that can be interesting for those markets. Interesting. It's been about 15 minutes of this interview, and we have not yet asked about AI, which obviously is a huge focus for financial markets. It's really driven the market over the last couple of years, and yet we have seen news over the weekend about low-cost competitors potentially disrupting the space, generating a lot of volatility. What's your take in all of that and where you see AI from here? Wherever there's change, there's always going to be volatility, and people tend to run ahead and then pull back and adjust, but the broad trend of the power of this compute and the ability to leverage it to create productivity gains and efficiency, we're early in the ramp up of that. I think one of the ways to think about it, and I've heard this from big tech leaders, is the cost of this compute is going to come down, or the power of the compute at the same cost is going to go up, and you're going to see meaningful shifts in that every three months. This is happening. It's happening quickly, and the power of that to generate productivity gains is real. Take away the short-term noise, the short-term volatility. This is another example of technology continuing to drive growth and productivity, and also, interestingly, we sit in the middle of a lot of this here in the United States, although there's obviously competition around the world, but I just think the direction of travel with respect to the ability to load this technology into the enterprise and make people more productive were very early in that cycle, and I'm quite optimistic about it. How is Goldman Sachs thinking about harnessing AI for its own businesses, and what are you advising clients in terms of using it for their businesses? Well, at the moment, the compute is very expensive, and so you really want to focus on use cases where you think you can move the needle and really drive productivity gains. The most obvious one for us, we're an organization of 46,000, 47,000 people, and we have 12,000 engineers in our organization. We would have more if we weren't constrained by our desire to drive returns in our business. The ability to increase engineering productivity so that we can do more is hugely advantageous to us. That's an obvious place where we've been very focused, and I'd tell you that from what I've seen and what I've been shown, that technology is really accelerating, which can allow us to do things that could take a handful of engineers weeks in very short periods of time. We're very, very focused on that, but we're also focused, if you think about our business as a knowledge business, there are lots of places where putting these tools into the hands of very productive knowledge workers can accelerate their productivity and also where they focus their time to add value to their clients. And you're seeing businesses that we talk to doing the same. Absolutely. All businesses are wrestling with how these technologies can either improve the productivity of their people or change processes in ways that drive efficiency. The first is easier than the second, but CEOs I talk to across all industries are thinking carefully about this, but also being slow and prudent and thoughtful because you have to look at the costs, make sure it's going to work. You have to have good governance around this from a risk management perspective. And so a lot of focus, but I think you'll continue to see it accelerate. So David, as we're talking, I hear about plenty of opportunity, but also plenty of risk. I'm going to ask you a question you often get asked, which is, what keeps you up at night? There's lots of things that keep me up at night, but generally speaking, I sleep well and the glass is half full. I think we're in an incredible position to continue to drive growth. I think the fact that in the US where we really have had for a period of time kind of preeminence from an investment perspective, preeminence from a technology and innovation perspective, preeminence from a financial system to capital formation perspective leads me very, very optimistic about the US. And our ability to navigate significant things that will come our way. I worry about all the things that we worry about. I worry about geopolitics and instability in the world. I worry about cyber significantly. I think it's a real issue. There are lots of things to worry about. And look, one of the things that I think we should be thinking about at a time like this when everything feels so optimistic to the forward is what could go wrong. If we woke up a year from now and markets were 20% lower, why were they 20% lower and what happened? And thinking about those things and kind of looking around the corner, I always think is a helpful exercise in something we spend a lot of time doing at Goldman Sachs. So I'd just like to end with the fact that five years ago, the firm held its first investor day and you laid out the firm's strategic objectives at that time, many of which we have achieved, if not exceeded in many cases. So David, how are you thinking about setting up the firm for the next five years? So we are executing a plan that we really initiated five years ago to grow the firm, strengthen our core franchise, and really create value for shareholders. We're well on our way on that journey. I think the firm is very, very aligned and we have room to continue to execute on our growth plan, which is particularly centered around asset and wealth management. I think we've done a great job strengthening our core business of banking and markets and capturing share. There's still more we can do there. And as we generate capital as a firm, we will continue with growth in the world to allocate more financial resources so we can keep growing that client franchise. I think we can grow asset and wealth management business high single digits, continue to improve the margins and the returns in that business, which uplift the overall returns of the firm. And I think the firm is very well positioned for further growth in the future. So I feel very, very good about where we are. We are hugely focused on productivity and efficiency, which I think is a very good thing to always be focused on in our business. And I'm excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us as a firm to serve our clients with distinction in an environment that I think is going to be a little bit more constructive for the business community broadly. David, I'm glad to hear you're sleeping well at night. You know what? We need our rest to tackle the challenges in 2025. Thanks again for joining us. Absolutely. Thank you very much for having me. It's always good to talk to you. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Monday, January 27th, 2025. I'm your host, Alison Nathan. Thank you for listening.

So what's behind the sharp moves in global bonds, and what could they mean for the economy and for investors? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today I'm joined by Johnny Fine, Global Head of Investment Grade in Goldman Sachs Global Banking and Markets, and by George Cole, Head of European Rates Strategy for Goldman Sachs Research. Johnny is here in our New York studio, and George is joining us from our London office. George, Johnny, good to talk to you. Pleasure to be back. Thanks, Alison. So George, let's start with you. Global bonds have been markedly, and I would say unexpectedly, no investor that I know of was expecting this level of volatility heading into the new year. So help us understand what's driven the recent moves. Yeah, thanks, Alison. So if we go back over a kind of multi-month period since, say, around about the September period of being very substantial moves in global bond markets, U.S. yields moving about 100 basis points higher at the 10-year point on the curve, a similar move in the UK, maybe about half that in European yields. And all of that is really, I think, due to a revision of expectations on growth, on inflation, and on the monetary policy path that is expected particularly from the Fed. Now part of that is because the U.S. data set has been better. We've seen improvement in things like the labor market, where there was some source of concern if we go back to the September period. We've also seen the Fed revise its view of inflation. It did that at the December meeting, leading to a revision of expectations of just how much the Fed could be cutting interest rates. And of course, after the U.S. election, we had a fairly substantial pricing of U.S. growth stronger across U.S. macro assets. And so all of that has pushed up bond yields across the curve. And I think what is really important to note, and really important when we think about the interaction across global bond markets, is it's not just been a change in the policy path for yields, and particularly in the U.S., it's also been an increase in bond risk premia. And the way that we would think about that is we know that deficits are large. There is a lot of supply of sovereign bonds coming to market. That is much easier to digest if inflation is low, growth is slowing, and central banks are cutting. When you see expectations going in the other direction, actually what we are seeing is the market demand additional risk premia in the curve. So we see this simultaneous increase in rate expectations, but also bond risk premia in the major bond markets. And so, Johnny, is that what you're seeing, just this sense that there's a digestion problem brewing in the bond market? I think it's a combination of things. And I think those things are all rooted in fundamentals, at least in the near term, uncertainty and fear. And the fundamentals in the near term are what's the data telling us. So obviously, it's very unusual. We began a cutting cycle in September, and 10-year yields are almost 100 basis points higher than they were than when the Fed started. That wasn't on anyone's bingo card coming into 2025, or certainly the back end of last year. But the fundamentals, as George mentioned, have been good. Growth dynamics have been good. The labor market has been strong and robust. And economic data has been leaning towards more inflationary as opposed to disinflationary. And that has changed the narrative around the path of short-term rates for the Fed. So coming into the payrolls report, market's priced in just over one cut for the remainder of 2025. It's a little bit more than that now. But it was really just kind of one cut, there and thereabouts. And as David Miracle and other people in the research group frequently remind me, the expected path of rates is really a probability-weighted average. And when you kind of think about where we'd gotten to, if you have one cut that's priced in by the end of the year, that could be, if you have like a two-person survey, it could be one person saying, I think there's going to be two cuts, and one person saying, I think there are going to be no cuts, and therefore the probability-weighted average is one. If you looked at all the data and volatility as to where things stood, there was actually a 35% probability that over the course of the next 12 months, the short-term rates would be high, i.e. the Fed would be hiking. That seemed a little unusual. It didn't really seem to square with the data, but there was obviously a lot of fear and uncertainty that was in there. There's a lot of uncertainty, I think as well, with respect to government policy. The reality is, is that under the next administration, we know what the direction of travel is for things that impact rate markets, fiscal policy, trade policy, immigration policy, government efficiency as well. We know what the direction of travel is. We don't know how far away the destination is, and we don't know how fast the car is driving towards that destination either. That won't be clear for several weeks and months. That uncertainty has embedded itself in a much higher term premium than we're used to seeing in treasury yields. In fact, I think we're at the highest level of term premium for over 10 years, or certainly since 2015, in 10-year treasuries at around about 60 basis points. Now, one thing I think that the market is doing with this uncertainty, and this comes to the fear point, is that they're pricing some of these outcomes to worst. They're pricing some of the outcomes from a tariff perspective to worst. They're pricing some of the outcomes from a labor market tightness, deportation, impact on labor input costs, et cetera, et cetera, to worst. They're pricing some of the fiscal imbalances to worst as well. As a result of that, that created, I think, the backdrop for this significant run-up in yields and increase in treasury volatility. That's kind of how I think about it, fundamentals, uncertainty, and some real fear leading to what I think has been some inefficiencies in how the market's priced term yields. Right. So, term premium, by the way, is just what investors demand for holding the risk of sovereign bonds, right? Further out the curve. Yeah, exactly. Above and beyond what might be thought to be the fundamental value of the yield curve at that point in time. But if we take a step back and we think about market expectations, which have driven a lot of this, as you have said and George has said, it's been, from my perspective at least, very volatile in the sense that last year at one point, the market was pricing seven cuts. Now there, as you just said, there is a meaningful probability being priced into the market of hikes. Obviously, the data has changed, but even before the election, it just felt that the market was particularly sensitive and particularly volatile. Is that true or is that just my impression? No, it's very, very real. And I think a lot of what's rooted in that is when we got to the peak of the hiking cycle, there was the expectation that there would be a real bite taken out of economic activity, the transmission mechanisms of higher interest costs for consumers, higher funding costs for corporates, the consequent impact on economic activity, and it didn't really happen to a meaningful degree. And so the narrative started to shift towards U.S. economy can do pretty well in a higher yield environment, even on a sustainable basis. And then what changed from there was with the activity levels remaining robust and with, as said, the disinflationary indicators starting to slow and it becoming clearer that we'd get to the Fed's 2% inflation target more slowly, markets started to really ask the question as to how restrictive really is monetary policy. And so no one really knows what this thing is. We call R-squared, which is the neutral rate of interest above which there should be contractionary pressures on the economy and below which there should be expansionary. But markets started to say maybe that R-squared, which people had previously thought was around about 3%, might actually be nearer 4%, which means that we're therefore much nearer the end of the cutting cycle than anyone had thought previously. I think that's probably not the right interpretation for the market to have, but to me, that's been in part a significant driver of some of this volatility. And the one aspect that you touched upon in your original question that we haven't really responded to is the technical pressure of the supply of treasuries that might come to market. And I think this will be really interesting under the next administration. One thing that was notable about the funding strategy of treasury, particularly in 2024, was that a lot of the issuance was in the bills market and the very short duration markets overall that were going to money market funds and therefore not going to the term markets, not going to 10 and 30-year treasury notes and bonds. And so de facto, there wasn't the pressure on the long end of the curve last year. Some of the incoming members of the administration have been quite vocal about this not being the appropriate financing strategy that they would like to see play out, wanting to have a longer duration average issuance pattern and strategy. And people have started to kind of think about, well, maybe that means that this mix of bills versus bonds is going to shift under the next administration. Scott Besant, the incoming secretary of treasury, it confirmed, has been outspoken on this point. The incoming CEA chair, Stephen Myron, has been very vocal about how in effect the last administration followed what he calls an activist treasury issuance program, which is that de facto using government funding as a tool to impact monetary policy transition into the real economy. Interesting. So George, even though in the last week or two, we've seen a bit of a bond market panic, as I would describe it, bond yields are actually off their recent peak, in part because the data is a little bit kinder, if we think about the U.S. inflation data in particular. But how vulnerable is the market to more volatility ahead? It seems like this is just data point by data point. I do think that really does speak to the uncertainty that Johnny mentioned earlier. The market has gotten a little more nervous about the inflation trajectory. And so the incoming data that we got in the U.S., quite a modest downside surprise to inflation, but nonetheless enough to see yields correct, you know, fairly substantially lower. It was of course reinforced. We had a move in UK CPI where arguably, you know, maybe the stakes were a little bit higher given inflationary concerns there. That was also a downside surprise that offered some calm to the market. But I think what that is telling you is that the inflation data still really does loom large. And so of course, incoming prints are going to matter a lot. I think that when you think about the Fed's perspective, there remains uncertainty about the inflationary impact of the various policies of the new administration, tariffs being a good example of that. Johnny's point is very well taken. The market I think so far has concentrated, at least in the U.S. outlook, on the inflationary consequences of tariffs rather than necessarily the growth impact. I think that that probably is not quite true in the rest of the world where, as we might speak about later, there's been a much less rosy or optimistic repricing of growth, say in Europe or China over the last couple of months. But it does mean that that uncertainty, until it resolves, is probably going to keep the volatility around the data prints relatively high. Now on the data path we're expecting, there won't be renewed inflation pressures coming out of, say, the labor market or forward inflation expectations. Outside of potential tariff-affected categories, we are expecting inflation to continue to moderate in an underlying sense. And ultimately, that provides some more anchoring or medium-term relief for yields. But of course, until we get through some of the early phases of this administration, we learn a little bit more about upcoming policies, we're probably still going to find the data points quite volatile. But, George, do you think about tariff inflation differently from, let's call it, normal inflation? Obviously, tariff inflation is one-time in nature. Does it demand, therefore, the same monetary policy response as would, quote-unquote, normal inflation? Or is this kind of like really something the market practitioner should be a little less concerned about? Right. And by the way, will the market appreciate that difference? Yeah. I think it's a great question because ultimately, we've had a similar debate before if we go all the way back to the 2021-2022 inflation episode, which not in full, but at least partially was driven by some temporary supply-side distortions that, of course, was infamously leading to the description of transitory. Now, it is right that a one-off change in the price level, in theory, you should be able to look through such a change. But what is really key is do you see second-round effects where that initial surge in inflation, maybe for a single or temporary supply-side shock or some one-off price change, does that affect behavior in the rest of the economy by raising inflation expectations, raising wage demands that then see that inflation shock propagate through the rest of the economy? Now, the good news, I think, now is that the fears around those second-round effects are subsiding. And I think that that is true across many economies. And in the US in particular, if you look at things like wage pressures, measures of inflation expectations outside of a particular survey we got on the University of Michigan release, they have generally been quite benign and suggest that the risk of those second-round effects are pretty limited. Now, of course, it will depend on the uncertainty around tariff policy. One of the aspects that I think is still unclear is do we get a set of tariff announcements and then think that that is it, or does it increase uncertainty further down the line about more to come? All of those sorts of things probably need to be weighed up. But as it stands, we are relatively optimistic that outside of the categories directly affected by tariffs, we are going to see those second-round effects remain quite low and that monetary policy is probably got to be anchored on that underlying inflation dynamic that we still are pretty optimistic about. So Johnny George obviously has a pretty benign view of how things go ahead. But when you talk to clients, both on the investor side and on the corporate side, how concerned are they about the rate outlook as they think about their strategies? On the investing side of the equation in the business that I traffic in day-to-day, which is corporate debt, investors love these high yields. By definition, great risk-adjusted returns available for their portfolios. And that's been in part something that's kept credit spreads at what are now very close to multi-decade tights. From a corporate issuer's perspective, those who think about their issuance cost on a fixed rate cost of debt basis, they're continuing to grapple with the same issues that's really been present for a couple of years now, albeit having made peace with the fact that we're not going back to a zero interest rate environment and a 2% 30-year anytime soon. And so the good news is that for the most part, earnings are outstripping any impact from this increased interest expense and growth opportunities are creating investment opportunities for our corporate clients that are hurdling even with higher inputs for cost of capital. So that means that there's continuing demand to issue corporate debts, been a pretty busy start to the year. We'll kind of really have a better picture of that post-corporate earnings and as we get into the bulk of the first quarter. But for many, it's business as usual. Now look, at the same time, I think where we are, especially compared to a year ago when we had elevated yields, but a sharply inverted yield curve, we now have a positively sloped yield curve. So it is cheaper to issue shorter dated debt than it is to issue longer dated debt. I'd expect some corporates to avail themselves of that lower financing cost, especially those who were very responsible in the low yield environment and really turned out their capital structures. There'll be others, I think, that will look at the financing environment and saying, sure, that's the cost of doing business, but maybe I'll average in over the course of the year as opposed to getting all my financing done in one fell swoop. And they'll average in by either issuing debt a couple of times as opposed to once, or they'll use some interest rate derivatives to help manage that risk. And George, if we think about that relationship between global growth and yields, how are you thinking about that at this point and at what point would yields begin to weigh on our growth outlook? Well, I think that we spend a lot of time talking about the fundamental justification for higher yields and the improved prospects for the US economy that was being embedded into that yield move. And I think that's a really great contrast to make against the rest of the world where it's not as obvious at all that either there is the support for that higher yield view in the growth data. If we think from Europe to China to the UK, growth data has been anemic. And although you've seen maybe a slower than expected decline in inflation, it still looks like inflation is on a downward trajectory in those economies. And yet what you have seen is that yields have been dragged higher as a result of the US move. So I really do think that the story between the US economy and the rest of the world remains quite a divergent one. And we're in, perhaps not for the first time, a situation where we need to ask the question is the yield move we're seeing across global bond markets appropriate for all these economies? Or is it really an issue of having to live with the higher yields that are being generated by the US economy? And so we've seen rate spreads widen, particularly between the US and Europe. That seems to us to be fundamentally justified. But it may well be the case that we see this yield move start to decouple or look a little bit stretched against some of those growth fundamentals in the other economies. Now in the US itself, I think that we are, particularly since the December Fed meeting, seeing a slightly less favorable response in risk assets to the move higher in yields. And of course, the response to the US CPI relief was quite telling in that regard. Now that probably tells you that at least the question is being asked, is the size of the move in US yields now compatible with very high growth expectations in the US? Our analysis suggests the move has probably not been big enough to be self-correcting just yet. But I think that that is looking a little clearer in some of these other economies where the fundamentals are less strong, that maybe these yield moves, at least from that spillover that we're seeing from the US, are becoming counterproductive. I do think that the UK has really been one of the best exponents of the spillover effects from higher US yields and a higher duration or term premia in global curves. And the reason I would say that, the UK is a twin deficit economy. It borrows from the rest of the world. It has a fiscal deficit. And as a result, it probably should be a relatively high beta expression of yield moves when global interest rates go up. Last question, maybe more of a speed round. George, where do you then see bond yields moving through 2025? We do think they're moving lower. We're forecasting 4.35% on the US 10-year yield, 4% in gilt yields, which is a long way below current levels, and 1.9% in European yields. Now, of course, that forecast depends on the relative growth and inflation trajectories continuing to show, at first point, divergence, so we're expecting weaker growth outcomes in the UK and the European economy versus the US. But we're expecting underlying inflation progress across all three. And that really does remain the key. There are some maybe headline inflationary effects that might give volatility to inflation releases over the year, particularly in the UK. But as long as we're seeing that progress in underlying inflation moving lower, as long as we're seeing the evidence that those second-round effects that central banks were so worried about, something we shouldn't fear for 2025 and beyond, we do think that this gradual cutting cycle will soothe bond markets and see rates a little bit lower. As always, though, we're, of course, watching the data like a hawk, and in particular, some of these inflation releases. And Johnny, do you agree? I mean, you can't ask an economist and a banker a speed round question without getting a two-minute answer, so I'll do my best. So I think the following. I think that the markets fear that the neutral rate of interest is higher than anyone thought it was 12 months ago. I think that's overblown. I think the market is underestimating the potential fiscal responsibility, both in terms of income as well as spending, from the next administration. And I think the market is overestimating the impact on inflation from tariffs that will be implemented under the next administration overall. I think all of those things together make me a bond bull for the year. Great. Thank you so much, Johnny and George. Thank you for having us. Thanks, Alison.

I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I have the pleasure of sitting down once again with Sharmeen Mosavar-Rahmani. Sharmeen is the Chief Investment Officer of Goldman Sachs Wealth Management and the head of the Investment Strategy Group. Sharmeen and her team recently published their 17th Annual Outlook in which they share their investment themes and recommendations for clients. Sharmeen, welcome back to Exchanges. Thank you very much, Alison. And until you said 17th, it hadn't registered that there were that many of them, but yep, quite a few. Time flies. So let's start at the beginning, as I always like to do, and talk first about the cover of your piece and the title in particular, which I know you and your team put tremendous thought in. I say this every year, but every year it's very true. This year's piece is entitled Keep On Truckin'. So talk to us about why you chose this title. As you know, and hopefully many of your listeners already know, U.S. preeminence has been one of our key investment themes. So we're always trying to convey the message that that investment theme is still valid. Maybe at some point it won't be, but we can't foresee any such change. So again, here when we say Keep On Truckin' and we have a big image of something very U.S.-oriented, we're trying to convey the message that U.S. preeminence is intact. And in fact, the U.S. keeps on trucking ahead of everybody else. And the distance between the U.S. and these other countries just continues to get longer and longer. Absolutely. You could not have been more right on that theme that we discussed quite comprehensively last year at this time, but even in prior years. But 2024 was certainly a year of U.S. dominance. But we now had yet another year of phenomenal U.S. stock performance and valuations really, by most measures, are very, very stretched. So even if you believe that companies in the U.S. are going to continue to outperform, is that already fully priced in? That's an excellent question that a lot of our clients are asking. So on the U.S. side, clients are saying, given how well the U.S. has done, shouldn't we actually continue to be just invested in U.S. equities? And why do we even have any other assets outside of U.S. equities, whether it's public or private, but just the concept of non-U.S. developed equities or emerging market equities? And the non-U.S. clients are saying, given how expensive U.S. equities are, why not tactically shift towards non-U.S. equities? And our view is that while equities are expensive, when we actually look at valuations in this environment, we're saying that valuations alone, and the level of concentration in the S&P 500 index, for example, alone, are actually not good indicators of the next year's returns. So in fact, if you look at these valuation metrics, and you look at the range of returns that we've had at different valuation metrics, and you look at, let's say, a scatter chart, and we have some really good exhibits in the actual report, you see that there's no significance to either of these measures in terms of forecasting the next year's return. So that is actually not a very relevant factor. For us, the fact that U.S. GDP is going to be well above trend, somewhere around 2.3% based on our numbers, we know that Goldman Sachs research has a slightly higher number than we do, but generally a very good economic backdrop that is more likely to generate really good earnings. And so with good earnings, we think these valuations are manageable. Now longer term, it's a different picture. Are we going to get somewhat lower valuations over the next five years? Yes. But we also extensively discuss that it is a myth that equity valuations are mean reverting to a long-term, let's say post-World War II mean. Interesting. So where does that leave you, that valuation perspective and your earnings expectations leave you for returns for U.S. equities in 2025? So when we look at the returns for U.S. equities and look at returns outside the U.S., basically we're talking about returns somewhere depending on the country between 7, 8, 9%. So for the U.S., our base case is an 8% return. This compares to a 6% from last year, but we don't want clients to think we're actually more bullish because this 8% would have been a lower number if we didn't have the downdraft we had over the last several weeks of 2024. So in fact, the number is a tad higher only because we had that big downdraft. So our base case returns are somewhat similar. And then in terms of our upside, we actually have a reasonable probability that U.S. equities will do better than that. That's why we look at the returns and we say stay invested. Between the base case returns and the upside, we think you're going to have pretty attractive returns. But just to put that in perspective, that's down from high double-digit returns in 2024. Yes, we've had two years in a row of returns over 20%. So when we think about valuations, we totally agree that U.S. equities are expensive. In fact, we have a series of metrics we look at, and based on these metrics, either we're in the 9th or 10th decile of valuation metrics. So no doubt, very expensive. But for example, we were in the 9th decile in 2013 and equities were up several hundred percent over a long period of time. So I don't think valuations alone tell you you can't continue to have good returns. And in a good economic environment, our base case is you're going to get good earnings growth. And so hence, stay invested. What about interest rates? I have to ask you this because, of course, today again, we had a blockbuster payroll number in the U.S. and we've seen interest rates, the 10-year in the U.S. moving up close to 5%. Many investors now think they're going to be at 5% or above 5% in 2025. Does that pose any risk to your view? Our base case is that interest rates will come down. Now, the market is very jittery because they're worried about tariffs. They're worried about, do we have a trade war? Could that create inflation? But our base case is that we will have some tariffs. It's not going to be anywhere immediately to the full level that was discussed during the campaign. And so if they're incremental and there's going to be going back and forth, you'll have a lot of market volatility. But the key driver of inflation will be other factors. And we'll continue to have a steady lowering of inflation. Nothing too dramatic, but slowly, slowly going down. And that will actually lower interest rates. So we expect fixed income rates to actually be a little bit lower. But what's really interesting is the vast majority of corporate debt in the U.S. is fixed. So in terms of affecting companies and having a negative impact, it's actually negligible. The interest burden of U.S. companies right now is so low because we had interest rates at such a low level. So that's not going to be a major factor. The question is, are we going to use a totally different discount rate for forward earnings? So obviously, if rates were to go to 5% or higher, that would be a factor. But that's not our base case. In addition, people are saying rates could go higher because of the debt trajectory of the U.S. And we've done a lot of work, as have your colleagues in the economics research team, that it is not an immediate concern. It's really a much more long-term concern, and there's enough time to actually change that debt trajectory. So we're not concerned that in the next year or two, we have to do something about the budget deficit. So you're at, as you said, 7% to 8% for U.S. equity returns and returns of some of the major other indices in developed markets. Where does that leave you in terms of your overall asset allocation strategy recommendations for 2025 in the context of what you've just mentioned about rates as well? We have been overweight U.S. equities for quite some time. So if we go back to 2009 during the global financial crisis, the overweight that we had in our strategic asset allocation recommendation for clients was about 23%. So we were looking at the overall benchmark, let's say the MSCI Old Country World Index, where were U.S. equities, and we were significantly overweight. But as U.S. equities have continued to outperform, the weight in the index has gone up, and now we're only overweight by 7%. So we said, well, that's too little, given our view of U.S. preeminence. So either we could shift out of non-U.S. equities, both developed and emerging markets, and go into U.S. equities, or we actually made a decision to say, we will lower that allocation to non-U.S. equities by a marginal amount, it's not a huge amount, and we will actually put that in private assets, specifically in buyout and growth equity. Our view is over the next 10 years, for example, buyout and growth equity, most of which tends to be U.S.-oriented, will outperform non-U.S. developed and emerging market equities. And so we made that shift, and that's, again, a long-term strategic shift. Interesting. And when we think about those allocations, though, and just bringing up the question that I believe you said your clients outside the U.S. are most asking, though, yes, you might see U.S. companies continuing to outperform, but everything else looks so cheap in other major developed economies and beyond. So to what extent, though, should that be considered a buying opportunity for some markets outside the U.S., should there be some increase in allocations at all to some of these places? Our response to that question for clients is that, yes, when you look at the numbers at a very superficial level, it looks like they're extremely cheap. By any measure, the discount is, let's say, in non-U.S. developed economies at historic lows. We actually have never seen them be so low, the discounts relative to the U.S. However, our view is you need to actually dig a little bit deeper to understand what is the true level of cheapness. What do we mean by that? If you look at U.S. equities, 30% of the earnings of the S&P 500, for example, comes from the broad technology sector. If you look at the U.K. equity market, which is one of the cheapest out there, only 1% comes from the technology sector. So if you have a bigger weight to a sector that trades at a higher valuation, because the earnings growth is much faster, then you're not really comparing apples to apples. So if you look at the U.K., it looks cheaper, partly because it has so little technology. Another sector to look at is the energy sector. The energy sector is a mid-single digit in the S&P 500. It's double digits in the U.K. market. And so again, that's a much cheaper sector. So the U.K. has less of a more expensive sector and a lot more of a cheaper sector. And so you need to make that adjustment. And suddenly these markets do not appear as cheap. And so our view is, yes, they are cheap. They're not as cheap as it appears initially. And then when we make this sector adjustment, one of the questions we're asking ourselves is what is the right discount for these various countries? What is the discount they should have relative to the U.S. given it is a faster, economically growing country? It has a very diverse economy, and it is not exposed meaningfully to a slowdown in China's economy. A lot of these other markets are going to be severely impacted as China's economy continues to steadily, really steadily slow down. So does it go without saying, given your views on China in the past have been very pessimistic and very, very right, honestly, that China is not a buy here, even though we are seeing more stimulus moving into the economy? And some investors seem to want to try to take advantage of the very low valuations there. One of our views about China is that China at best will follow the path of Japan. They will have a Japanese slowdown. It's inevitable from our perspective, not just because of demographics, but because of all kinds of headwinds that they're facing. And so when we look at the Japanese equity market, since it peaked, you have had opportunities in the general downdraft for big rallies. And so we look at that and say, well, maybe China could follow that because they could have stimulus programs, they could make statements, investors could get all excited, and you could have a rally, just like we had last year. But it's not sustainable. And to give you a good comparison to Japan, if you look at Japanese equities, where were they at the end of 1989-1990 when the Japanese equity market bubble burst? It did not exceed that peak level until the summer of 2024. So it's actually incredible that there's been opportunities to buy Japanese equities and big rallies, but they've all lasted a limited amount of time and then we've had a downdraft. And so again, if at best China follows the path of Japan, that would be why it's a trading environment, not an investing environment. The other asset I wanted to ask you about is gold. It had a very strong year in 2024, and it is historically thought of as an inflation hedge. And as we've been discussing, there are some concerns that inflation could resurge in 2025 off the back of Trump policies, and in general, the resilience of the U.S. economy that we have been seeing. So should gold be a bigger allocation in portfolios this year? We've done a lot of work on commodities in general, and then gold and oil specifically. They're definitely not strategic asset classes. There are times where you want to be tactical, and over the life of the investment strategy group, we have been tactical both on oil, on natural gas, on gold. And so yes, there are opportunities to be tactical. But right now, what is driving gold is not inflation, because in fact, gold has shown not to be a good inflation hedge. In fact, U.S. equities are the best inflation hedge. Gold and commodities are not a good hedge against inflation. And so they're not a great store of value, nor short term a good inflation hedge. So then what is actually driving gold right now? It is significantly driven by central bank purchases, and then specifically by Chinese purchases, both central banks and consumers. And so how long will that last? Maybe China, as a protection against any kinds of sanctions or freezing of assets, if geopolitical tensions were to escalate, they want to diversify away from certain assets and own actually directly some gold for a while, that could continue and that could drive some upside. But that's again, more of a trading issue and trying to figure out what China could be doing long term, which I think is very hard to predict. And so we're somewhat agnostic about the pricing. And we say we don't think we can predict it. And so we don't think clients should tactically get engaged. I think that's an interesting point, because empirically, you're saying gold has not shown to be a good inflation hedge, even though many investors think it is. So interesting point there. Should I even dare to ask you about Bitcoin, which is another asset that investors seem to be excited about in this type of environment in particular. And ultimately, we have seen more institutional investors getting involved, we've seen a proliferation of instruments that allow them to do so. So where do you stand on Bitcoin today, or crypto in general? So when it comes to Bitcoin or crypto in general, we have not changed our view. There's a great quote that we refer to from information gathering firm, and they curate information and present it and they had a great quote. And we refer to it in our outlook, that price action creates its own investment thesis. So just because prices have gone up, now everybody's coming up with reasons one should own Bitcoin. And we're like, that is not a legitimate argument. What is the underlying investment rationale to own or not own Bitcoin. And we've had this view all along. We said, it is not an investment asset class. If you think about it, it doesn't generate cash flows, it doesn't generate earnings, it's not a portfolio diversifier, it doesn't dampen volatility, you could go through all the different reasons. So it's still not an investment asset class, but it is a trading speculative asset. And so if people want to speculate, then they should. But it's not something we recommend, because there's no way of knowing if the current price is a good price. There's no way of actually assigning value to something. And there's certainly no shortage of cryptocurrencies. A lot of the rally that came in Bitcoin came after the election. And there's a view that a lot of people have that this administration will make a huge difference to it. But the actual value argument hasn't really changed. So given everything we've discussed, is this the kind of environment in which you want to be hedging your portfolio? The most important recommendation we make to clients so that they can withstand the unknown volatility is to make sure they have a strategic asset allocation that allows them to withstand the downside. Because hedging is expensive. If you buy a lot of put options to protect yourself against equity market downside, or if you go out of equities, whether it's US or non-US, you could be giving up a lot of upside. And if you're a US taxpayer, you'd certainly be paying a lot of taxes if you sell your current equities with a lot of gains. And so the best way to prepare for this volatility is to make sure you have the right strategic asset allocation that would have enough fixed income in it. High quality fixed income long term is the best hedge and gives clients the ability to withstand that interim volatility. Because actually hedging with derivatives is very expensive. You could be hedging against the downside and need to buy options for a couple of years before anything happens. And so that is not our recommendation. Charmaine, always a pleasure to talk to you.

I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. To get their fresh outlooks for asset classes and portfolio strategies, I'm sitting down with Christian Müller-Glissman, who heads asset allocation research in Goldman Sachs Research, and Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-chief investment officer of the multi-asset solutions business in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Alexandra is joining me in our New York studio, and Christian is joining us remotely from our office in London. Christian, Alexandra, welcome to the program, and happy new year. Happy new year. Happy new year to you. So it's the first podcast of the new year, and I cannot think of a better way to kick it off. But before we get into our 2025 views, let's start with a quick recap of what worked well and maybe not so well for portfolios in 2024. Alexandra, maybe give us a quick sense of that. Absolutely. I think the headline should read long risk. Long risk worked very well as both U.S. and global economies outperformed what the expectations were more broadly. But underneath that, in the broader indices, there was actually meaningful dispersion in sectors, regions, and size. Just some examples are that U.S. large caps outperformed small caps to the tune of 12.5%. Europe underperformed the U.S. by one of the largest margins that we've seen in a very long time. But there were also interesting stories, not just in the U.S. and Europe, but across the rest of the globe. So you saw places like Argentina experience a strong revival. The indices within China posted positive returns for the first time in a few years. And then in other risk assets in particular, credit markets, especially in the U.S., had a banner year. So you had IG spreads tightening by about 25 basis points, bringing us close to historic lows at 75 basis points. And you saw similar moves in high yield, lesser extent in emerging market debt. So very strong storyline for broader risk assets. Now there were some other, you know, bases where you saw some real outperformance and underperformance. So, for example, in the currency market, you saw the yen be a strong underperformer and the U.S. dollar be a strong outperformer, largely due to yield differentials. But also there was the storyline of what's happening in politics in the U.S. And then last but certainly not least, I can't not talk about duration in a particular U.S. interest rates, because the expectation was you're coming into a Fed cutting cycle. The Fed did cut 100 basis points, but we actually saw the market restrike the price for growth and for what could be ultimate change in fiscal policy. And so you saw yields back up since September the 10 year, about 100 basis points. So it was certainly not a dull year, to say the least. Right. But certainly a friendly macro backdrop for risk assets, as you just said, and especially U.S. assets in 2024. And a lot will depend this year again on how friendly that macro backdrop is. So Christian, what's your view on that? Does this business cycle still have legs? Yeah, I think broadly our macro baseline is still friendly. We still have global growth that's healthy, probably not dissimilar to what we had last year. We still have inflation coming down a bit further and central banks cutting rates. But there is a subtle shift. I think what we had in the last two years is you might remember this. We talked about the inverse Goldilocks scenario where I think risky assets in particular, but generally most assets have benefited from this inflation normalization where inflation came from very high levels and declined. And we called it the inverse Goldilocks scenario because normally Goldilocks means growth picks up without inflation. And what happened in the last two years is inflation went down without growth going down. The result is the same. You're improving the growth inflation mix. And that usually anchors risk. That helps risk premia compress. And it's a very friendly backdrop for multi-asset portfolios because 60-40 type portfolios can do well, equities and bonds can go up together, and generally Sharpe ratios tend to be high. And I think now we're going into a bit more of a reflationary type backdrop. I think we still have good growth, but inflation is unlikely to come down as much anymore. So I think that is a shift that investors need to deal with. That kind of means potentially lower Sharpe ratios, less risk premium compression, less kind of valuation expansion. And to some extent, it might also mean less narrow performance. I think Alexander mentioned earlier, yes, equities did well, U.S. equities did particularly well. But it was very narrowly concentrated on the Magnificent Seven, on momentum as a factor. And that is a lot linked to this inverse Goldilocks scenario. Because what we find is in Goldilocks regimes, carry trades tend to do particularly well. Alexandra mentioned credit spreads tightening. Again, that's very much a symptom of an inverse Goldilocks scenario or Goldilocks scenario, credit doing very well, carry trades doing very well. And the Magnificent Seven are a bit like a carry trade because you have like recurring revenue in structural growth in most people's minds. So valuations can expand for those areas. And it's going to be much tougher with the type of macro regime that we anticipate for this year. And Christian already started to talk about how some of these differences this year from 2024 might impact allocation strategies. Where are you on that, Alexandra? How are you looking at allocation strategies in 2025 versus 2024? Yeah, so we all know that the economy is not the stock market and a lot of returns got pulled forward in 24. And while we might be looking at the expansion of the cycle or a different phase of the business cycle, we are looking at late cycle valuations. And equity valuations are very challenged when you look at premium versus the rate market. But at the same time, you've got this meaningful supply demand shift that's happened in rate markets, and it's caused rates to back up, even though you do have disinflation, even though we are in a much better place in the economy. Where does all that cocktail leave you in terms of allocating your portfolio? We do still believe that being overweight risk in equities is the right place, although we bring that in from a much higher level of risk taking just given that valuation backdrop. And in duration or rates, we're more focused on relative value across the globe rather than just expressing it in the U.S., places like the U.K., where the inflation picture has been a little bit stronger in terms of how they've been able to rein it in, or spaces like China, where they're going through some of a deflationary regime. And away from that, we've talked a lot about dynamism and how this bifurcation is happening. That's going to be a really great space for alternatives and alternative managers. So increasing allocations to things like hedge funds makes sense to us. I want to dig into some of that a bit more, but Christian, do you generally agree with what Alexandra just said in terms of thinking about this? So the main message we're giving is twofold. First of all, you want to think about more diversification across assets, a bit like what Alexandra said, maybe mix bonds and equities a bit more. I think 60-40, we've already said in our podcast last year, will start to look a bit better. And it did, but mainly because equities did well, not because the bond market did well. I think this year, you might actually see more performance contribution, further risk reduction contribution from bonds in multi-asset portfolios. So you want to think about diversification across assets, more balance in the portfolio. And the other thing that will be important for this year is more diversification within assets. Don't just rely on a few stocks and possibly the same momentum stocks that have driven most of the equity return. So last year, try to find opportunities outside of these winners. And that's again, typical late cycle. When you're late cycle, you shift towards Babel strategies where you're marrying or you're combining winners, quality stocks that are already doing really well with selective laggards. And the key challenge will be where are those laggards? Do you diversify internationally? Do you go towards Europe? Are the opportunities look selectively at emerging markets laggards, which might benefit from a bit of stabilization in China? But let me just play devil's advocate for a moment, because you have talked about the risk that Magnificent Seven outperformance can't continue, the market concentration risk related to that, and valuations being so stretched as reasons to be more concerned for 2025. But if I think back to our conversation a year ago, 18 months ago, those risks were also front and center, and yet that outperformance continued. So why are you convinced that those trends won't continue today? From my perspective, I'm not saying that we expect the Magnificent Seven to massively underperform, but you have to consider starting point. I think valuations have expanded further, valuations are higher now. And I think the key challenge you have is what we found in our work is a large part of the valuation premium of the Magnificent Seven can be justified by the superior profitability and cash flow generation. And so far, that has made us actually quite relaxed about the Magnificent Seven. The problem is this last year, the valuations of the Max Seven and the S&P 500 in aggregate has started to overshoot our structural fair value model that incorporates profitability and to some extent free cash flow margins. So the challenge you have now is the market is somewhat overpaying a bit. And the other thing you have to consider is that these companies occasionally can disappoint. And this is particularly relevant to your question on concentration from an asset allocation perspective. Normally as an asset allocator, you try to diversify idiosyncratic risk. But if you are in the business of asset allocation with benchmarks, the benchmarks are very exposed to some of those names currently. Just to give you a sense, currently the top 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are driving more than 50% of the volatility of the S&P 500. That's never been as high as that. The volatility contribution is actually higher than the market cap weight of the top 20 stocks because often the Max Seven or the largest stocks in the index are more volatile as the index. So to your point, I'm worried from two perspectives. The first one is those stocks are more valued. They've seen valuation expansion at the macro fundamentals, the micro fundamentals for those stocks might start to disappoint a bit considering they've had such a strong run because they need to get better to some extent to justify those valuations. And the second factor is that from a kind of asset allocation point of view, the concentration now with regards to risk is actually even more extreme than it was at the beginning of last year. The contribution to volatility from those names is actually significantly higher now. So it needs a bit more addressing now compared to the same time last year. Alexander, do you have thoughts on that? Again, investors are like, look, this has been working and the macro backdrop generally remains friendly. Why should I change course here? Larry Markowitz famously declared that the only free lunch in investing is diversification. And to Christian's point, it's important to pay attention where there's been unknown biases introduced into your portfolio that could drive high levels of volatility that are unexpected. And just some further data points to what he mentioned, 20% of the S&P 500 is concentrated into three big names with the average trailing P.E. of about 44. 70% of the ACWI is concentrated into the U.S., which implies 14% exposure to those big names. And when you're looking to asset allocate, you're being thoughtful about allocating across markets, regions, size, active management. And you need to be very thoughtful about, do you want that to be part of your structural bias in your portfolio or is that a dynamic or tactical decision? And so we're very thoughtful about explaining it from a long-term perspective versus medium and short-term. In 2024, the bar to diversify away from large tech was really high because you were starting to see CapEx cycles kicking off and it was just really the beginning of seeing how corporates were going to hone into these AI projects and how growth was going to be elevated for many of those names. Now, we're a little bit later into that CapEx cycle and we have improved clarity. And so we don't expect returns for 25 to be the same as 24. We're not, similarly to what Christian's saying, we're not saying run away from tech, but there's a lot of different opportunities that don't have the same length or extension or leverage in them, if you will. And one of those, again, you had mentioned was private markets. So talk to us a little more about that and where you see the most compelling opportunities there. We believe that private equity firms will have a much easier time exiting over the next few years relative to the 22-24 period and the IPO market is already primed up for some explosion there and that should really do well for IRRs. And then we've also mentioned that this backdrop of a lot of potential volatility, divergence, more tactical trading is very good for hedge funds. So we want to add things like that, those alternative premiums into our portfolios. But it's more about adding different layers of diversification to your portfolio, especially even though bonds, to Christian's point, higher levels of yield provide more diversification. We could see a regime where it's much stickier or higher when we discuss inflation, and that will prove challenged to adding more duration to portfolios. Finding ways to get more diversification, be in private markets, by the way, which move, in particular private credit, moves less violently than public markets. And then you can reallocate when public markets have experienced their big drawdown from some of those tight levels we saw in high yield. From our perspective, it's going to be a very important allocation going forward, in particular this year. So let's talk a little bit more about risks to these views, because if I'm hearing both of you correctly, they're still upside. You still want to be leveraged to risk assets, but you want to think about diversification. What would meaningfully change your view of the world, Christian? Yeah, so you have a highly concentrated equity market with the same winners that have been the winners for a long time. So anything that challenges their business model or changes the perception about what investors are willing to pay for those is dangerous. And to your point, it might not seem very likely considering, as you were saying, it's something that has worked before. Why should it not work now? But I think we're getting to a point in terms of valuations, as I mentioned earlier, that certainly makes us a bit more worried. But also we're getting to a different phase in, to some extent, the AI trend. And there's more capital intensity, there's more competition. This kind of risk of concentration and overpricing or over-extrapolating of success is something that worries us. And we're watching particularly the ROE, we want to understand if the ROE can continue to stay at these high levels for the largest stocks in the S&P 500. If you only get a trend down in the ROE, the market might start extrapolating that as well. So I think that's the first concern. The second concern that matters both for equities standalone, but also for multi-asset portfolios is, of course, inflation. Yes, inflation momentum has turned less negative. If I look at inflation surprises, like in the G10 economies, actually the proportion of countries that are currently seeing large inflation surprises up or down is close to the lowest level on record. So in other words, inflation risk has really moderated. The bad news is the market is pricing that as well. So one way to assess inflation risk premium is to look at breakeven inflation. So what the market is pricing for inflation for the next five to 10 years, and compare that to consensus economics forecasts for inflation. And currently, what you find is that the inflation breakevens, like the market pricing of inflation, is actually below the forecasts. So the market prices very little inflation risk premium. So the fact is, it's not necessarily that you have to worry about inflation re-accelerating massively. It could just be the fact that inflation is just a bit stickier and a bit picking up, that considering where inflation risk pricing is, could cause a bit of a setback. And I think the last few weeks were a bit of a preview of that, where I think the hawkish December FOMC meeting has certainly led to a pretty large reaction in the bond market, possibly larger than justified. Certainly our economists think so, where now there's very little price for Fed cuts for this year, and also the term premium. So the steepness of the yield curve has significantly picked up. So this is still making us very nervous, like how the bond market is still finding its equilibrium. And similarly, how the inflation risk and the inflation risk premium are still finding the equilibrium. And the last thing I would say, and this is a bit more fuzzy, is tariffs and geopolitics. I think we are going into a year where the policy uncertainty is unusually high. If you look at these famous economic policy uncertainty indices, and you look at the trade policy component, it's through the roof. It's actually at the levels from 2019 already, without even any tariffs or any significant trade policy changes being enacted. That could be good and bad. It could be good in the sense that this trade policy uncertainty is already very high. And that means the market is already pricing that risk. But it could also be bad in the sense that we might make new highs with regards to trade policy uncertainty. And maybe the market is not prepared for that. So a long list from Christian, Alexandra, anything to add to that? Yeah, so I'll just reiterate two things along the same vein. I think any Fed communication error as it relates to where they see the neutral rate being and adjusting higher going forward could lead to more volatility in the bond market. We see some risks of the divergence across the globe showing some fragility in currencies, which could have a domino effect. And last but certainly not least, I'm going to come back to the bond market. There has been a material supply demand shift in the bond market. And yield sensitive buyers versus price sensitive buyers, you don't have as many yield sensitive buyers and you have central banks coming away from that market. Meanwhile, supply has grown in the Treasury market, something to the fact of in 2019, the market has grown 11 trillion since then. These are staggering numbers. But on the other side, private borrowing on a net basis has been really contained. And so the aggregate issuance in the bond market has been somewhat understandable and easier for buyers to digest. But I do think that indigestion still exists. And that's why we're having this hard time with term premium, where the ultimate level of the 10-year should be. And so we're trying to pay very close attention to auctions, how they're performing. Do they have big tails? This week alone, we're supposed to see something up to the tune of 120 in U.S. Treasuries and 50 in billions in corporate credits. So how does that look? How does it get digested by the market? I think supply demand is still going to be really interesting there. Understood. So both of you, if you think about the risks that investors are facing today, have talked a lot about diversification during this conversation. Are there any other hedging strategies that you are observing investors taking advantage of in the face of these risks? I think, listen, the first line of defense in asset allocation is always diversification. So I think you want to look at alternatives that can help you with the scenarios when equities and bonds together don't really work well. We've been quite constructive on gold. Central bank demand for gold in particular remains strong and should drive further upset to gold prices. I think you can think about diversification to certain currencies that maybe help you with the risk of central bank repricing. So the dollar is clearly one that screens very highly. We have the stronger for longer view. It's a bit tougher. We have to be completely honest after the rally we've had since December. It's been a quite remarkable rally, but certainly it's a strategic view that we hold for the next year that the dollar will also help you for tariff risk. It will help you potentially for geopolitical risk. And you can possibly mix in other safe haven currencies there. In terms of broader hedges in the options world, etc., we certainly looked a lot at credit. We do find that credit spreads have been remarkably tight. We're entering a world that might be a bit less carry friendly. If you look at implied volatility in credit, it's remarkably anchored and low. So we've looked at opportunities there. But to keep it simple, just the simple equity put into kind of the January inauguration into the earning season to us makes a lot of sense right now. It's picked up a bit because obviously since December, that kind of skew has picked up a bit. It's been a bit more volatile. But I would still say the cost of options broadly considering the uncertainty for next year in both directions. But for us, we're obviously concerned about hedging our existing portfolio and our existing allocation. I think options seem cheap to me in equities. So we just like the idea of hedging into especially the inauguration and the U.S. earning season because we're very nervous about our E and corporate profitability. So we've covered a lot today. What I'm taking away is the investor outlook still looks relatively positive for 2025 contingent on the macro backdrop remaining benign. But there are risks and diversification. Other hedging strategies might make sense in this environment. Thanks so much, Christian and Alexandra, for joining us today. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having us.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-12-20 05:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### A perfect setup for the financial sector?\n**Episode ID:** 4519\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nU.S. financial companies have seen their share prices surge since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Investors believe the new administration will loosen capital rules, lower corporate tax rates, and boost capital markets activity. But are investors getting overly optimistic? And what's the outlook from here? To explain the outlook for the financial sector, I'm sitting down with my colleagues in Goldman Sachs Research. Richard Ramsden is the business unit leader of the financials group, and Alex Blastein covers the asset management industry. Richard and Alex have just finished hosting their financial services conference here in New York, where more than 100 firms across the industry spoke about the outlook for their businesses. Richard, Alex, welcome back to the program. Great to be here. Great, thanks for having us. So there's obviously been a lot of excitement around financial services firms. What are the key themes you're both tracking as we look toward 2025? Richard, let's start with you. So I think there's three or four things that really matter. The first is banks are the most macro of the micro sectors. So what happens to the economy is going to play a key role to the performance of these banks heading into next year, both around the performance of net interest income, which is very sensitive to what happens, not just to fed funds, but to the shape of the yield curve. And then what happens to things like unemployment and corporate delinquencies, which is one of the primary drivers to credit quality. So the state of the economy is going to be front and center. We do have a new administration with new policies that does create some uncertainty, which is gonna be something which I think we'll be monitoring very closely to try to see what impact that is having on corporate behavior in particular. The second thing is, as I'm sure we'll discuss, there's a lot of enthusiasm around a potential recovery in capital markets activity. So M&A and ECM activity are actually a pretty depressed levels compared to the 10-year averages. All of the ingredients are really in place for that to pick up next year, which could be a pretty powerful driver to the top line for these firms. The third thing is we're very focused on some of the operational trends around loan and deposit books and what that is gonna mean for net interest income. So loan growth has been pretty sluggish for the last 18 months. I think there's some hope that will accelerate as we head into next year. And then you have interest rates that are coming down and banks repricing deposit books and how that goes is gonna have a really important impact on just the level of net interest income, which is a key revenue item for these banks. And then lastly, the change in administration is going to have potentially a very big impact on the regulatory framework for these banks. Still a lot of moving pieces, but you could see some pretty significant changes in terms of the amount of capital these banks have to hold, the ability for them to merge, which is gonna be something else that we'll be monitoring very closely. Obviously, with the election of Donald Trump, there's been a lot of focus on tariffs and inflation down the road, those inflation concerns potentially rising again. What would be the implication for the banking sector if that were to take place? And is some of that already being priced in? So I think a couple of things. The first is you gotta really unpack what tariffs could do both to the short end of the curve, so to the path of Fed funds rates. And then secondly, what does it do to the shape of the curve? I think at the short end of the curve, the risk is that if tariffs do have a bigger inflationary impact than perhaps the market currently believes, you will just not see as many rate cuts over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And that would then limit the bank's ability to reprice some of the expensive funding that they have. So, so far you've had two rate cuts effectively. These banks have pretty successfully bought down deposit funding costs around those rate cuts. So if you get fewer rate cuts, funding costs could remain structurally higher. The second point though, which I think is important, is if tariffs lead to a structural change to the way that the market thinks about inflation over a period of time, you could actually see a steepening of the curve. And the steepening at the kind of long end of the curve is quite positive for banks. And the reason is that banks have got a lot of fixed rate assets that they put on in 2020, 2021, 2022 at very low yields that are repricing. So these banks have got securities that they bought in 2020 or 2021 that are yielding between two to two and a half percent. Those securities are repricing to four to 5% today, if not even higher. They've got fixed rate loans that are repricing much, much higher. And they've also got swaps, which are also repricing. So a steepening of the curve, provided that it happens without a recession, would actually be pretty positive for these banks from a revenue perspective. And then you also mentioned potential regulatory shifts. What's really at stake here for banks? Well, quite a lot. If you think about the last four years, you've seen a lot of regulatory changes. So the capital framework for the banks has got harder to navigate. So capital requirements have gone up and the framework has become more complex. Second, you've had a whole range of initiatives from the CFPB, which is the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that has put in place pricing restrictions on things like overdrafts and late fees. Although that legislation hasn't been finalized, the banks have preempted some of those changes in pricing structures. And then the merger environment has also got very difficult for these banks. So it's taken a lot longer for mergers to close. And I do think that this administration has been looking through mergers through this multifaceted lens of what does it do to competition, but also what does it do to the availability of banking services in certain markets? So I think, look, in terms of the changes, I think where we are most focused is what happens to the capital rules. You've got a proposal out there, the Basel III endgame proposal, as it's referred to, that was gonna lead to about a 10% increase in capital requirements for the biggest banks. It's possible that gets either watered down or it doesn't get finalized. But even beyond that, it's possible that this new administration is gonna undertake what we call a comprehensive review of the capital standards and ask the question, look, are we getting this right? I.e., we've increased the capital requirements, that's reduced systemic risk, that's a good thing, but that's come at a cost. And the cost is that there is less lending capacity from the banking system. Has that held up economic growth? So I think they're probably gonna be more inclined to look at the cost benefit of these capital requirements and ask the question, can we bring down these requirements without generating a lot of systemic risk, but provide more capacity to support economic growth? Second, look, the merger environment, I do think, is going to get easier. I do think that the incoming administration is going to be more likely to look at bank mergers as a way of increasing competition because you create larger banks that have more scale. And then I think even on some of these proposals around fees, I suspect they're gonna take their time to make sure that they really understand some of the unintended consequences in terms of what it could do in terms of product availability or lending availability for certain consumer groups that could be disproportionately impacted. And Alex, if you think about the asset managers in particular, what are the themes you're focused on? Yeah, I'll give you a couple of highlights. First, I would echo a lot of the enthusiasm that Richard talked about for the banks for really broader financial service industry. When it comes to the asset managers, a couple of things really stood out. First, continued allocation towards private markets. It's a theme that we've talked about for many years. You and I have talked about it a bunch of times on this show. That's not really slowing down, but the one point I would make is it's starting to broaden. One of the challenges we've seen in this space is that it's been really concentrated within private credit for the last couple of years. And I know we talked a little more about that later on in the podcast, but it's starting to expand into private equity, so there's a bit of a cyclical recovery there. There's a lot of capital needs in the infrastructure sector, and we've seen a lot of capital raise there. And there are some early signs of stabilizing trends in real estate, which has obviously been under some pressure. So that's the first theme. The second one is around the push from a lot of these private markets firms into the wealth channel. Really low allocations today. Effectively, every CEO of every major alternative asset manager has it on their to-do list, point number one, two, or three. So that'll continue. And then the third point is around money in motion. We've seen continued growth in money market funds for the last couple of years. There's almost $7 trillion in capital sitting on the sideline in cash vehicles. It's starting to come out. We've been waiting for that to start moving into fixed income funds more aggressively. It's starting to happen towards the back end of the year. If the yield curve starts to steepen, we could see that expand pretty meaningfully, and that would be obviously very positive for the asset managers. And Alex, if we do see a recovery in M&A and capital markets activity, how will that affect alternative asset managers? Yeah, the cyclical angle in this space could be pretty material. So if you look at deployment of capital from private equity firms, it's started to pick up already, but the new administration and change in M&A backdrop could give it a really nice boost. Couple things I would say on this front. First, the amount of dry powder is still very significant, still sitting about a trillion dollars in the U.S. corporate private equity alone. Financing costs already starting to come down. You've seen that with lower base rates, but also credit spreads have contracted pretty nicely in the last 12 to 18 months. So availability of capital, financing costs have been very supportive. So if you get a slightly better regulatory backdrop, you could see a lot more activity. At the same time, the realization backdrop has been actually even worse. So deployment, as I mentioned, started to accelerate earlier in the year. Realization rates are running at all time lows. And we've talked in the past that a lot of the private equity clients, the LPs of these firms, have been looking to get their capital back. There's been a big lock jam in the system. So with more open ECM market, more capital market activity, more M&A market activity, you should see pretty material acceleration realizations. We're thinking in our models about 70% increase in performance fees into next year from that type of activity, which is obviously quite significant. With that lock jam really created by the valuation gap between sellers and buyers, and it's just been very difficult to offload assets. Yeah, and that spread is starting to narrow. I think financing costs coming down have a lot to do with that. Also public market multiples have actually moved up very nicely. So the public multiples are now slightly higher than what you find in much of the private market. So this actually gives a private market asset holder an ability to exit their investment at a more attractive multiple at a more attractive price. The other thing that's gonna do, and that kind of goes back to the point I made earlier around broadening of the fundraising activity, this will create this flywheel, right? This is gonna create some of the capital that will go back to the LPs, to the institutional investors. It will enable them then to commit to their next flagship fundraising cycle, et cetera, which is ultimately the point of what these companies do, right? They invest and they harvest it. And Richard, you talked a little bit about loan growth and the outlook for loan growth. We look at banks because they tend to be a bellwether for the economy. So what did you hear from the many CEOs that you were with in this past week about demand and the underlying strength of the economy? And how does that feed into your outlook for loan growth in 2025? Look, consumer loan growth, especially card growth has actually been pretty good. And I think the reason is that you actually still have relatively healthy levels of consumer spending. So consumer spending on credit cards typically leads to consumer borrowing on credit cards. You know, so I think you look at the outlook for consumer loan growth in card, it remains pretty good. On the corporate side, it's been very weak. It's actually been negative for quite a lot of the year. And I think there's a few reasons. The first is it's only been 18 months since we saw the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Signature Bank. And you did see the industry tighten up underwriting standards considerably after that because they did increase the probability of a recession after those bank failures. And that led to a slowing of loan demand because they did restrict who they were willing to lend to. Second, you've had this increase in capital requirements. So banks have been prioritizing building up capital as opposed to lending money to some of their user groups. And then third, there has been competition from private credit, which I'm sure is something we're gonna talk about. And at the margin, I do think that the industry has lost some market share towards the private credit industry just because they can't compete with some of the terms and conditions that the private credit industry can offer. I think heading into next year, we do think that loan growth is going to pick up. Bank of America at the conference talked about 4% annualized loan growth in the fourth quarter, which is a pretty healthy level. And I think with the election behind us and with lower interest rates, which obviously improves affordability of borrowing coupled with improving corporate confidence, you would expect a pickup in corporate loan demand in particular over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Alex, let's pick up on that private credit theme because obviously it's been a big market mover and focus of the markets and focus of regulators even. Well, first of all, where are we now? And then how do you see that evolving in the coming year? Private credit has been one of our favorite themes for the last couple of years. And if you look at the space today, it's running north of $2 trillion in total AUM. So it's up considerably. The average growth in the space has been high teen to 20% for the last couple of years, as I mentioned earlier, accounted for almost 60% of all fundraising that we've seen in the private market space. So still a really big deal. I would make a couple of distinctions though. There's almost two separate lanes that have evolved within private credit. There's the direct lending business, the more traditional levered lending that competes mostly with levered loan markets and high yield markets. That is becoming relatively more mature in our view. If you look at all of their levered loan space today, direct lending accounts for about a third. So still runway, is it gonna go to 60%? Probably not. Could it go a little bit higher? Sure. The dynamic of compressing credit spreads is also at play, right? So the returns you were able to get 69 months ago are likely not gonna be the returns that you can get in the forward kind of 12 to 18 months. Part of that is lower base rate. Part of that is the fact that as Richard mentioned, the banks are back and financing availability is pretty wide. So spreads are compressing. Still really good returns, but not what you used to get 12 to 18 months ago. The newer lane is this kind of asset-backed finance. We can call it private credit 2.0, but that is much more of a private investment grade credit. And that is growing much faster and the addressable market is also much, much larger. If you think about the equivalent in the public domain, that is investment grade bonds. It is loans sitting on the bank's balance sheet. It is real estate loans, things like that. So a lot of the private markets firms are going after that part of the market. It's more complex. So I do think the value of the space will accrue to fewer players. You need to have robust proprietary origination. The structures are more complex. It requires more people. And the fees are also a little bit lower than what you find in typical direct lending loans. So all in all, we think the total growth in the space is likely gonna be still pretty strong. So in the teens, 15 plus percent for the next several years. But we do think the sources of that growth will pivot more towards this investment grade private part of the market. And Richard, will that dent the performance of the big banks we think of, or will it enhance it? There's a lot of co-mingling here between these businesses, from my understanding. Look, there's no question. I think private credit is both a threat, but it's also an opportunity, especially for the big banks. And the threat comes from the fact that they are, to a degree, competing to provide credit to the real economy. And these private credit firms are obviously just not regulated in the same way. And that just gives them a lot more flexibility in terms of the types of products and the types of structures that they can offer. I think against that, there is an opportunity. The first opportunity is to team up with a private credit firm. And you've actually seen a number of these joint ventures, which means that if a client does want a non-traditional loan, they can team up with a private credit firm to perhaps offer them a product that they wouldn't have offered them themselves. So you can actually enhance the client experience by offering a broader range of products than a bank could offer standalone. Second, look, this growth, this tremendous growth that Alex talked about in private credit is creating this financing opportunity. There is underlying leverage in a lot of these private credit products, and the banking industry is financing some of that. So you have seen this growth in what's been referred to as fixed income financing over the last few years. And one of the big drivers of that has been this growth in private credit and alternative assets in general. And look, those are quite complex products. So you've got to be comfortable with the collateral. Again, you're often dealing with clients, which are important to these firms in a range of different ways. And look, the banking industry has benefited from providing that financing. The risk-adjusted returns on that product are actually quite attractive. So keeping all of this in mind, how are banks and asset managers thinking about their strategic priorities heading into 2025? I don't know if the strategic priorities have changed that much. Most of these banks are focused on opportunities to grow organically. And I think at the margin, they feel that the opportunities for growth are better today than they were six months ago. So I think you will see an acceleration of these large banks filling in geographies where they don't have a big presence on the consumer front. And I think you probably will see them push a little bit more aggressively in terms of opening up underwriting boxes, both to consumers and corporates, because they feel better about the prospects of a recession next year. And I think they're also anticipating that deregulation across the economy could also spur an increase in CapEx, which in turn could lead to a pickup in loan demand. So I think a lot of them are trying to position for this better growth environment. Second, I think that these banks continue to focus on ways of improving operating leverage. So automation and AI are obviously very important themes for the industry. Although a lot of these banks will say, look, AI isn't that new, it's just a continuation of what we've really been doing over the last 10 years. And just to give you a really interesting number here, you look at Bank America over the last 15 years, their balance sheets more than doubled and their headcount has shrunk by 100,000 people. It's pretty remarkable, this substitution of technology for labor. And then the technologies are obviously a lot more scalable and the marginal costs are a lot lower, which means that when you do grow, the margins from that new growth do tend to be really attractive. And then third, I think when we do get the new capital rules to the extent that we do get them in the next six to 12 months, I think these banks will go back and rethink their priorities around dividends, buybacks, and the opportunity to make inorganic acquisitions. So M&A. I would say growth clearly is top of mind, but I think the evolution of the asset management space is happening at a pretty rapid pace and there are new channels that are opening up to wide variety of asset classes that really didn't participate in these channels before, mainly the wealth channel. So as we look across the whole landscape, whether it's a traditional asset manager or an alternative asset manager, thinking of ways of becoming bigger in private markets and then getting those products into the wealth channel is definitely top of mind for effectively most of these CEOs. The second one is a bit cyclical, but back to this point of money in motion, if we finally get to a point where there's more capital flowing back into the more traditional long-dated funds, whether it's fixed income or equities, you wanna be there in a position to capture it and you need to have obviously the right product, the right structure to do that. So we've seen a significant push into things like active ETFs. Quietly, that has been one of the fastest growing products in all of traditional asset management landscape and we think there'll be innovation when it comes to that. We think convergence between private markets and public markets will be another really big theme. So if you think about the retirement channel in an example and that dovetails a little bit into the regulatory framework, we didn't get to that on the asset management side, but the 401k market has been effectively closed to any private investment. And if you think about the duration of that capital, it's really no different than a public pension plan or any institutional pension plan, it's 20 year plus type of money. So having a liquid asset as part of your 401k allocation doesn't seem that crazy, but the regulatory environment has been really not allowing for that. So to an extent that changes, I imagine we'll see more partnerships between private market firms and the established liquid players in the space that are already in the 401k channel to bring more product to market then. So lots of innovation and lots of focus on growth. Interesting. So Richard, as we were walking over here, you made the comment that the tone of the overall conference last week was just bullish. Everyone was bullish. And I said, well, that makes me nervous. Does it make you nervous? What could go wrong? It definitely makes me nervous. We've been doing this conference for a long time. I think this is the 35th annual financial services conference that we have done. And this was definitely one of the most bullish tones that I've heard. So look, what could go wrong? A few things. The first is I think we've gone from this environment of political uncertainty to policy uncertainty. So yes, the election being behind us is a good thing in that the uncertainty around the outcome is removed, but now we do have all these open questions around what will be the impact of tariffs? What will happen around the immigration policies? Is it going to lead to a labor market that is too tight in the US? What's gonna happen to corporate taxes? And I think, look, what worries me is I agree with these banks that the direction of travel is up, but it's not gonna be up in a straight line. I think you are going to have a lot of volatility as some of these policies unfold and as the market digests the impact of some of these policies over the next 12 to 18 months. I think, look, the second thing is I do worry about interest rates. We talked about this, but I think the extent to which not only do you not get a lot of rate cuts, but you enter into more of a stagflationary environment, that would be pretty negative for the banks because you could end up with an inverted yield curve. So a lot of this asset repricing that we've discussed wouldn't happen. So that would be negative. And then I think the third thing that worries me is on the regulatory side, some of these changes could just take a very long time to come into effect. These regulators do tend to move slowly. It's very possible that we could be sitting here next year and still not have clarity over what's gonna happen to the capital framework. And that uncertainty could just lead to banks continuing to remain in a holding pattern in terms of redeployment of that capital. Alex, what worries you? Look, the asset managers are the market, right? The markets are at an all-time high, and that's always a little worrisome. I would say though, interest rates is probably the one big fundamental factor that hard to ignore, particularly parts of private markets, as we said earlier, was obviously set to benefit from easier financial conditions. And if that goes the other way, that could clearly slow down the pace of M&A recovery that we're all anticipating. But also there's still lots of unanswered questions around a chunk of the real estate market. And I think for the most part, people anticipate 10 year or two, either hang around this level or come down further if that's not the case, then a lot of the 2021 vintage that has yet to make its way through the pipe, so to speak, will remain in question. And that would be a big deal. So there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but also some reasons to be cautious. Does that sound right? I think that's fair. Fair enough. Richard, Alex, always a pleasure. Thanks for joining us. Great. Thank you for having me. Thank you. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Monday, December 16th, 2024.

I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. To help explain the state of deals and the road ahead, I'm joined again by Stefan Feldgeist and Marc Surrell, the co-heads of the global mergers and acquisitions business in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking and Markets division. Stefan is joining me here in the New York studio, and Marc is joining us remotely from London. Marc, Stefan, welcome back to the program. Pleasure to be sitting down with both of you again. Great to be back. Thank you. Thanks, Alison. Stefan, when we sat down a year ago, the M&A market was beginning to show signs of life, and I say that pretty hesitantly because activity was still pretty subdued. But this year, inflation has continued to moderate. We have seen the long-anticipated rate-cutting cycle of the Fed finally begin. And of course, the S&P 500 is making new highs, I would say almost daily making new highs. So putting all of that together, how has that helped spur dealmaking activity this year? What have you observed in terms of how dealmaking activity has evolved over the course of 2024? It's interesting. If you roll back to when we were together a year ago, we had a view that 2024 was gonna be somewhere in the range of a plus 10% year relative to 2023. And in fact, that's largely what it's been. But it certainly has been what I'll call as a gradual crescendo of factors that have really driven what I'll call a plus 10% year. And oh, by the way, as we look to 25, which we'll talk about, we are balanced and have a similar view in terms of 25 over 24. But you saw strategic activity, again, the imperative coming out of COVID to reposition remained. As interest rates came down, as pressure on financial sponsors to return liquidity to their LPs, as strategics began and continued to think about the positioning both globally and domestically that they wanted to do, that pressure added to in addition to cuts in interest rates, which obviously helps the cost of financing for both sponsors and strategics, led to that plus 10%. And we certainly hit five-year, 10-year lows in 2023. And so we're coming off a relatively low bottom, but you saw that pickup. And you particularly saw activity in Europe. Europe had a very strong year to what you saw in 2023. So when you put all of that together, it was a balanced 2024. And there were certainly headwinds. Obviously, regulatory was a headwind and geopolitics was a headwind. Obviously, there's volatility around the number of elections, not just in the United States, but around the world. And so that's why we maintain balance. There were factors pushing it stronger. And there were factors, as I just mentioned, that caused us to temper our expectations. Let's unpack some of those factors, because as you mentioned, the rate environment has been a big driver of deal activity. The Fed has started cutting rates, but rates themselves, if you look at the 10-year, it's been pretty resilient. We're back up well above 4%. So when you think about how corporates are viewing the rate environment today, is it better than it was in the last year? It's modestly better, but we have to remember the world got used to free money for well over a decade since the financial crisis. And if you look at the level of absolute rates now, it's still relatively low if you look over 30 years or 40 years or 50 years. But that takes some psychological adjustment because people were used to, particularly financial sponsors, who were the biggest beneficiaries of effectively an extraordinarily low cost of capital that we saw after the financial crisis. So as people have adjusted their models and have understood that this is the, quote, new normal, you've seen people get used to it, much like you see in an MA market. There's a period of psychological adjustment to both valuations, as well as to interest rates, which impacts valuations. And so you're seeing that normalization happen where people have now looked forward as this is a new normal, where capital is not going to be free. And the other big driver, when I think back to our conversation last year, was the uncertainty. We did have an impending US election and other elections, as you rightly pointed out, that could lead to material policy changes. If we think about the various policy shifts that the market is focusing on right now when it comes to tariffs, when it comes to geopolitical when it comes to perhaps a little less regulatory scrutiny, how do you think that's all going to come together to impact deal-making activity this year? So we think in decades in our business. And by the way, corporates, and you've seen it largely in the markets, when people were surprised that the markets weren't reacting or overreacting to any specific risk or short-term issue that came up, boards think in decades. And so every administration is impactful. And of course, you have to modulate and either accentuate or modulate things based on what policy is going to be in that period. But if you think about strategic activity in M&A, you're not making one-year or four-year decisions, you're making 40 or 50 or 100-year decisions. And so you modulate what you're doing, but you look out and think long-term. And so you look at any administration or any economic cycle or any interest rate cycle or any tariff cycle or any geopolitical issue, obviously, some of them are existential and of course, tragic, you have to think in decades. And where's the world going? Where's your business going? And where do you want to be in 50 years? Because these are long-cycle businesses. Some of them have long-cycle investments, we call it putting steel in the ground. But businesses are generational, multi-decade, and people are thinking that way. And that's why we remain bullish on M&A, regardless of the geopolitical or regulatory or electoral situations. But they do have an impact on getting things done in that shorter period of time, but less of an impact in terms of the overall strategic long-term activity. So where are we expecting to see deal activity most concentrated? I'll take it a little bit by industry and then a little bit by geography. We saw some incredible growth acquisitions over the last, call it, year and a half. You saw it in energy, where the large-cap energy companies wanted to accumulate molecules and inventory. So you saw the largest energy consolidation that we had seen in history happen in end of 2023 into 2024. You saw in healthcare, extraordinarily well-capitalized large-cap pharma buying products where they didn't have particular innovation or strength, whether that be MDRNA, whether that be weight loss. So you saw huge acquisitions of not necessarily startups, but smaller companies that had the technology. Large companies had the distribution and manufacturing, and they wanted to acquire the technology to grow. As we look forward, where are we going to see companies looking for that growth? We're seeing quite a bit of activity in consumer, where folks are looking to add brands, add businesses, some of many of which have been reported in the press. You're going to continue to see it in healthcare. You're going to see it also in technology, where large technology companies, much like healthcare saw certain areas, technology companies for decades have been looking at smaller companies with great ideas and great technology or great software and adding that to their portfolios. The key theme that, and I was talking to a CEO about this last night, that I think has become relatively universally accepted for different reasons, is that scale is increasingly more important. Scale across geography for diversification of supply chains and manufacturing, scale across products for being able to understand where growth might be and being able to capture those market opportunities, scale for financing and balance sheet heft in stormy financing or capital markets. All of those have really shown boards and shareholders the benefits of scale. And again, scale, as I said, has many different areas. And therefore, it's not just product growth and top-line revenue, but it's growth of scale, scope, and revenue. Interesting. Mark, do you have further comments on that, though, when we think, again, geographically, where deals could be centered in 2025? Yeah. So I think, Alison, what we've seen in Europe is that 2023 was a very muted year for deal activity because of the macro in Europe. What we've seen in 24 in Europe is a very sharp acceleration of activity. Within the space of a few months, we've gone to a much more normal rate of dealmaking in Europe. And that has taken place in a very concentrated period of time. And we've seen in spaces like financial institutions is a good example, a wave of transactions that are in some cases domestic, in some cases cross-border within Europe type consolidation transactions. So Europe, I would say, has been characterized by a very rapid normalization of activity. The other thing to remember about Europe is more towards private equity activity on average than the US. And so what the other thing we've seen in Europe this year is a real acceleration in private equity deployment, particularly in public to private. So we've seen a wave of large public to private. I think when you go to Asia, it's a more specific regional discussion. I'd say we've seen a recovery in Australian activity, a bit similar to what we've seen in Europe. The other bright spots in Asia are India, which remains very strategic for many of our clients, both corporate and private equity and Japan as well, where we've seen a real acceleration of some private equity, but principally corporate led large activity. The place that activity remains more muted and has remained more muted for obvious reasons is activity around China. But with that exception, my own view is that Asia is trending in the direction Europe has been trending. It's just running a few months behind in terms of the general trajectory. And I think that one of the questions, and maybe we'll come back to this later, is that the other thing we've seen this year is our clients start to look again at cross-border, just talk about cross-regional or cross-continent activity. We've seen that start to tick up. So a good example of that is we've seen three or four quite large corporate deals done by European corporates into the U.S. in various industries. That's really European corporates looking for growth by making acquisitions in the U.S. I think we will also see some U.S. corporates starting to look in Europe as well in the coming months. And so that is also a positive sign in terms of some of the things I think we're likely to see in 2025. And I would add to that, there's no question that the United States has been a net beneficiary of a number of factors, perceived stability, energy supply, on-shoring of manufacturing and investment from the government in certain sectors. And so you've seen a incredible focus on, as Mark mentioned, some companies looking to buy, quote-unquote, growth in the United States, but also just economic activity in the United States has net benefited from a lot of the global factors. Right. And for the most part, we expect that to continue. If we dig into a little bit, the private equity sponsors, which both of you have mentioned, ultimately, as we discussed, that's been a bit of a drag in recent years. We've begun to see places where they've gotten more involved, but there's still, from my understanding, a lot of cash waiting to be deployed. What will it take to continue to bring those sponsors back into the market? A couple of factors. Just to give some scale and scope, private equity had historically at its peak been close to 40% of the M&A market. It's dipped down low thirties into the twenties over the last couple of years. That being said, it's still a big part of the market. What's restrained it? Obviously, some of the things we talked about, the ability to sell businesses, monetize businesses, and therefore return capital has been very challenged. The other thing that is essential for an active M&A market is actually an active IPO market. For sponsors to feel the confidence to put their assets into the market, the dual track, as we call it, which is equally pursuing an IPO at the same time as M&A, is a very powerful tool. The IPO had not been readily available for them. It's becoming much more readily available. That, we think, will drive the exploration of monetizations to a greater degree, point one. The other point, though, is that sponsors now sit on a number of portfolio companies at 10 billion or well over 10 billion. Selling those businesses is hard because it's just obviously given the size, a relatively narrow buyer universe. The IPO may be the only exit for some of those businesses, but that will really spur the engine if you start seeing a number of these large portfolio companies either going public or getting sold. The other thing has just been also a mindset of, are sellers willing to transact? That mindset shift that I mentioned is happening. The number of public to privates has actually been quite substantial. That really hasn't slowed down. It's just been smaller deals. The pressure on private equity to return capital was there. It is growing. You're going to see that pressure compound now with more readily available exit options that we think will start driving the private equity activity to a greater degree. Just to add one point or emphasize one point Stefan made, if you actually look at private equity activity in 2024, the rate of deployments of capital increased quite rapidly. If you remove 2021, which was an extraordinary year for deployment, the rate of deployment is running relatively close to a kind of long-term average type levels. If you look at the disclosure of certain large private equity firms, there's a good number of firms saying their rate of deployment is on plan or even a slightly ahead of plan versus where they were at the beginning of the year. A lot of that, as Stefan said, has been public to private. The place where private equity in a sense needs to be a catch-up or activities running well below historical levels is on the exit side. That is the place, I think, in 2025, where we're watching very closely as valuation gaps close, bid-ask spreads close, and the IPO market improves. Do we see the rate of exit improve? Because that is then key to unlocking further activity. But I would emphasize the big difference from this time last year is how quickly the rate of deployment has improved, both, by the way, in traditional private equity and infrastructure. If you take infrastructure, digital infrastructure is a great example of where there's been incredibly active deployment of capital around the world. And as you just said, that lack of exits comes down to valuation. How much confidence do you have that valuation gap will close? Well, it's valuation and having an active IPO market where you can actually get public without such a dramatic discount that it doesn't make sense to do it. And so that's why we pair together the IPO market with the M&A market. For the sponsors, that's been a lot of the challenge. So if they entered businesses, 2019, 2020, 2021, the valuations were quite robust, and that's the challenge. But if you're a private equity sponsor, and by the way, as you noted, markets have continued to go up in the last two years. If you entered at a high multiple, they're very focused on obviously generating carry and returns. The benefit of holding is that you hold an option, and they had wanted to preserve and extend that option. How can they extend options? Either through refinancings or continuation vehicles, all of which you've seen in the last couple of years, because it preserves that optionality that they get the valuation that they're hoping for. That being said, as time goes on, IRRs or returns suffer from a longer duration. So that pressure mounts as well in addition to the desire for the LP staff capital. So when does that cross? It varies very much by each company, but there's no question that the pressure has been increasing through 2024 and will continue to increase in 2025, which is why, again, part of our balanced view on pickup is not that you're going to see a 40% pickup in the M&A market or in private equity monetizations, but that you will see a reasonable 10% to 15% pickup. And that's why we modulate the exuberance that you hear from some places in the market about the M&A market in 2025. It's kind of hard for me to believe that we've had this whole conversation and haven't really mentioned generative AI yet, which is such a big theme in the market. So, Stefan, talk to us about how that spending by very large companies and in general, this theme could be driving deal or impacting deal activity this year. We spend a lot of time in the boardroom talking about the impact of AI and what it's going to do to companies. And the number of industries that it touches is extraordinary. Of course, it touches semiconductors. Of course, it covers technology. Of course, it covers real estate. But of course, it covers the power companies and power generation and where's energy gonna come from to support these data centers, which are massive consumers of energy. How do the states and the countries deal with a new load, so to speak, on already strained energy supplies, and then you factor in climate and infrastructure. So every industry is touched by this. How will it translate to deal activity is to be seen. Will technology companies integrate into power companies? Will they buy their own real estate and development? How you think about private equity, where we've seen, as Mark mentioned, tremendous activity in data centers. Where will they place their bets? Where will infrastructure companies place their bets? And you've seen a number of it, whether it be in data center themselves, you've seen private equity active in merchant power, which are now some of the sources that are gonna be producing power. And you have the hyperscalers who are going to be massive users of power and consumption in the usage of large language models and AI. They're very focused on where they're gonna get their power. So they're looking to secure it. Now, a lot of that will be contract and partnerships, maybe M&A. I don't think it's going to be a huge part of the M&A market, but as AI matures, and as companies and applications and resources go into it, you will have a maturation of those companies where people will see and be able to value them, which is obviously one of the hardest parts. How do you value AI companies in this market? But there will be a maturation. So I think initially it will be investment in capital and partnership, and then it may evolve into more of an M&A market once the companies and the winners become more clear. Sonia D'Engelo So I think maybe just end the discussion with where we might be wrong. I do think that the banking sector has gotten a little bit of flack for kind of continuing to say that M&A is gonna pick up, but I think you have a very balanced view, Stefan, on what that might look like for 2025. What are you most focused on that could derail more activity in the coming year? Stefan Levy So we've mentioned some of them. Of course, as I've mentioned, these are long cycle decisions, but there certainly could be short-term disruptions. Look what COVID was. There's always black swan risks that could have strong impacts. You could have a regulatory view somewhere in the world. You could have a geopolitical disturbance or a war, which could, of course, disrupt things. All of those can certainly disrupt M&A activity in 2025. But again, we're focused on the longer term. We are very balanced. I do not sit here and think there's gonna be a rocket ship of M&A activity in 2025, and we advise our clients to be very balanced in terms of how they think about these things and think about the risks and when is the right time to do something that they want to do. Lots of things can go wrong, and we are always paranoid managers for the M&A business and think about risks continuously. That being said, when you look at the underlying forces, they are there, whether it be interest rates, whether it be the need for growth, as Mark said, whether it be strategic activity around the world, whether it be scale and the pursuit of scale. And so am I highly confident to see recovery to five-year or greater than five-year averages or 10-year averages over the next number of years? Yes. Can I tell you that's year one or year two? No, but that's why we view 10% in 2024, which turned out to be right, and a similar but maybe slightly more in 2025 is certainly my view. Marc, do you have anything to add? I would just add the way I agree with Stefan is we've had some headwinds in the last couple of years, regulatory headwinds, geopolitical headwinds, amongst others, and we're in a moment when our clients believe those headwinds are abating or reducing. And that, I think, is what's driving, even in the past few weeks, more optimism around larger transactions and the ability to move those forward. I think the risk to the market is that those headwinds don't abate or there are new headwinds or different versions of them. And that, I think, will result in more modest growth in activity. But my personal view is there will still be growth in activity. We're now at the point of it's just a question of the rate of growth or the rate of recovery of the next part of the cycle. I think we still believe that the next 12 months will be a better environment for particularly large dealmaking activity than the previous 12 months because of risk appetite, financing environment, regulatory conditions, geopolitical conditions. But I think that is the thing for me that is the, if you like, the single greatest thing we're watching is whether the environment for those larger, more risk, which are therefore, by definition, more risky transactions, whether the conditions continue to improve. Stephan, Mark, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having us. Thanks, Alison. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Wednesday, December 11th, 2024.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-12-16 22:15:32+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Will China’s policy stimulus be enough?\n**Episode ID:** 4521\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nChina is grappling with domestic economic challenges at the same time that external risks from U.S. trade threats are rising. In response, Chinese policymakers have announced a raft of stimulus measures, which they doubled down on just last week. But will the stimulus be enough? In the short term, we're probably going to see an expansion of fiscal support, much greater than we've seen already. Probably in the first quarter, we will finally start to see real attempts to stimulate the demand side of the economy. And that will be very positive in the short term. But ultimately, it's only a short-term solution. I'm Alisa Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month, I speak with investors, policymakers and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top of my report from Goldman Sachs Research. This month, I spoke with China watchers Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs, and Michael Pettis, professor at Peking University's Guangha School of Management. We discussed China's economic challenges and just how effective the policy stimulus could be in addressing them. I started off by asking my colleague Hui to level set on how China's growth has evolved in recent years. There were quite a few surprises in the Chinese economy over the past couple of years. If you think back to the early 2023 reopening, if China had followed any other economy's experience, there should be a very strong rebound. But 2023 growth was only 5.2 percent after 3 percent in 2022. So that was a disappointment given reopening boosted services activity. And then coming 2024, we had this surprise of very strong exports, but domestic demand continued to weaken, especially in the middle part of the year. I think that was a clear downside surprise. GDP growth quarter after quarter in young year terms was decelerating, which explains why end of September policymakers announced the stimulus. But overall, how much pain policymakers seem to be willing to tolerate was surprising. Just given investors' previous perception that when things get bad, Chinese policymakers will come out with a stimulus package, in a sense that still was happening, that things got really bad in the third quarter and we have this stimulus package. But the magnitude and the delay in policymakers' reaction function, those are all surprises. And so obviously, as you began to discuss, we have seen a slew of policy measures announced in the last couple of months. How effective do you think what they have announced so far will be? The biggest policy change so far is the local government debt swap plan. And that's the 10 trillion RMB package approved by the National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting early November. That's the most important piece of all the easing measures announced so far. This is trying to put out the fire and address the most urgent risk in the economy. Now, is it effective? It's too early to tell. We think that this is important and underappreciated because in a typical debt swap, it's just changing one form of debt to another. It doesn't do that much. It doesn't really change your fundamental balance sheet. But in reality, without this, the local governments are taking whatever they can take. And when they have the revenue, they are not spending on the schools and hospitals, they are spending on paying back debt. So that's hugely contractionary. And now you don't cut your spending on schools and hospitals. So it's very important to have this newly allotted quota. But is that quota allotment, that increase of new debt, is that big enough relative to the size of the outstanding debt? And it's my understanding that they can issue that debt over five years. So is it too little too late? Is it enough? Is it perfect? Probably not in the grand scheme of things, in the sense that overall local government financing vehicle total interest bearing liabilities are over 60 trillion. And in that context, if you give them, you know, two plus trillion a year doesn't seem to be that important. But I think of it as two things. One is we estimate that this year's fiscal shortfall is a little over two trillion RMB. So in that sense, central government now give them 2.8 trillion per year of additional quota seems to be enough to just cover the whole. So the central government did the math and give me enough to make sure that the deleveraging versus operating the government are separate. They don't want to pursue deleveraging and endangering the local government running the daily lives and daily activity for their citizens. If you don't give them this breathing room, this extra quota, they're going to use the tax revenue and all the other financing sources to pay back debt and prioritize deleveraging efforts. And that means everything else is a secondary, your civil servants, the salaries, your school lunches, your hospital bills and all the stuff is secondary. And that would be very disastrous, in my view. Are there any other policy developments that can move the needle? I would emphasize to one is the new measures on the equity market. That's new compared to previous cycles. We don't know the exact motive of whether this is trying to generate some wealth effect for households or whether it's a purity trying to generate more inflation because we have this deflationary pressure throughout the industrial sector, whether this is purity just for confidence. But the intention and focus on the stock market is notable. The other thing notable about this stimulus package is that the government seems to recognize that property infrastructure investment that alone that used to be the main driver or main lever for China stimulus no longer applies. So they're talking more about consumption. They haven't figured out how, but they are talking more about consumption. They have these goods trading program. A lot of the people we know are taking advantage of their sizable subsidies is a bit like a US Cash for Conquerors, you're trading your old stuff, and they give you a subsidy, you buy a new one as a working very well in the past couple months. So I think that's important in the sense that you can tell policymakers are also shifting very gradually that they need to think about consumption property. That's the past infrastructure can't find profitable projects anymore. We need to think about consumption. So then we get to November. We have an election in the US and we have Donald Trump being reelected and the accompanying threats of increased China tariffs. So talk to us a little bit about how much risk that poses to China's economy, especially since exports have been the bright spot this year. Yeah, so I think it's very important to differentiate the Chinese export to the US per se, which is targeted by Trump tariffs and other impact of Trump tariffs as a second round of factor as a sort of uncertainty impact. Because if you do the math, Chinese exports are about 20 percent of GDP, 15 percent of Chinese exports go to US. And in the extreme scenario, let's say Trump tariff is so high that nothing coming from China will go to the US as a 15 percent Chinese exports. But exports, the total is only 20 percent of GDP, and that's a three percentage points of GDP, about four trillion RMB. I think given China's own central bank and relatively low central government debt to GDP ratio, is that really end of the world? With the four trillion RMB, if I just bring four trillion RMB, nothing has happened. So from that point of view, it's not that big of a deal. Domestic issues are much more important than the tariff per se. But I think the problem is all these uncertainties. You don't know where to invest. You don't invest. So all these a second round effect is going to be much more impactful. In the case of China, we've been talking about this shift from export led growth to consumption led growth for a long time now. But we haven't seen them successfully do that. Do you think they're now finally moving in the right direction? We're relatively confident on the direction. You have to think about Chinese policymakers as human beings, right? Like you don't make change until you have to. Right. And I look back, I think because they press on the property stimulus or infrastructure stimulus, or they can do something easier and more immediate, and they have other instruments to deploy in previous cycles. They didn't have to undertake this very difficult task, estimated consumption. So that's the direction of travel. I just don't know how much they are able to do or how fast. Next, I spoke to Michael Pettis. I actually interviewed him a decade ago in 2014 about his views on China growth. So I began by asking him what surprised him most about China's growth since we last spoke. The last time we spoke, I had argued that the very high GDP growth targets that China set were much higher than the real economy could deliver. And so the only way they would be able to achieve the GDP growth targets involves significant increases in investment, mostly in the property sector, but also in infrastructure. And what I argued back then was because so much of this was non-productive, it meant that there would be very rapid growth in the Chinese overall debt burden. And I thought that policymakers would probably stop this process well before debt had reached current levels, but clearly they haven't. And so China's debt to GDP ratio, which officially is around 300 percent of GDP, is much higher than I thought they would have been willing to tolerate. The problem with that, of course, is that the ultimate adjustment is going to be that much more difficult because there's a lot more bad investment that has to be written down. When you talk about China's debt load, who holds that debt? Who's actually on the hook for it? The distinction between central government debt, local government debt, and even corporate and household debt doesn't make as much sense in the case of China as it does in many other countries, because ultimately the local government debt was generated because of GDP targets set by Beijing. And local governments were only able to raise these levels of debt because of an implicit guarantee by the central government. There is a widespread perception that local government debt is not the obligation of local governments. If they are unable to pay, ultimately the central government has to step in. And this extends not just to local government debt, but also to SOE debt, a lot of corporate debt, and even household debt. And the reason there is because the way Beijing looked at debt creation was as a way of generating these higher levels of growth than the economy could otherwise manage. So what that really tells you is that the central government, directly or indirectly, is on the hook for all of the debt within the system, because all of the debt, or almost all of it, is extended by commercial banks. And commercial banks all need to be recapitalized, and they are very unlikely to default on depositors. And so ultimately they have to be recapitalized by the central government. What is your view on how willing the central government really is to service that debt? Yeah, they're in a very tough position, because on the one hand, they want to keep the central government balance sheet as clean as possible. But on the other hand, they create very high GDP growth targets, and it's the responsibility of local governments to achieve those growth targets. And because the local governments are unable to achieve those growth targets with organic growth, with real growth by the private sector, businesses, etc., the only way they can achieve that target is by borrowing and investing in infrastructure projects that ultimately generate less growth than they cost. So these are loss-making activities, right? So as long as the local governments are required to do this, and they are, they have no choice but to let their debt burdens rise very, very rapidly. So they've argued that the reason they are so highly indebted is because they're following Beijing policies. So what does it mean? I suspect that what it really represents is a politically contentious struggle between the central government and the local governments about allocating the cost of all of this bad investment. Many people will tell you that local governments are bankrupt. They simply can't pay their debt. That's technically not true. Local governments are bankrupt from a cash flow point of view. Their revenues are way down and their expenses are up and they're not allowed to borrow. But they own an awful lot of assets. So ultimately, my guess is that this is the way Beijing is trying to put pressure on local governments to liquidate their assets in order to pay for the debt so that Beijing doesn't have to pay for the debt. Now, this is a very political process. In China, I think there's a popular misperception that the central government is so powerful that it snaps its fingers and everybody in China jumps. That's not true. There has always been a real division of power between the central government and the local government. And I think what's happening is that there is a fight between the two over how the losses are going to get allocated. If you are Beijing and you want to see an increasing centralization of power, one of the ways to achieve that is to weaken the economic power, which means also the political power of local governments. So to the extent that you can force the allocation of losses to local governments, who will then pay for it by liquidating assets, then you're able to kill two birds with one stone. Address the debt problem and further centralized power within Beijing. Let me just move on and ask a bit about the policies that have been announced so far. There has been this increased ceiling for local government debt to be able to issue more debt, new debt to deal with their existing debt. How effective do you think that policy is? Not effective at all, because what it really represents is moving debt from one pocket to another. So the pocket where it's hidden off balance sheet into the pocket where it's on balance sheet. Some people say that this is very good for local governments because the off balance sheet debt has a higher interest charge than the on balance sheet debt. The on balance sheet debt is pretty close to being sovereign debt. So the required coupons are much lower. The argument is that this frees up cash flows for local governments that they can spend on services and transfers, etc. It's a very popular argument here. But there are two important problems with the argument. The first problem is that when you look at the actual savings, they're really tiny. We're talking about 50 billion a year, 70 billion a year and a hundred and twenty three trillion economy. This is really not going to change anything. Secondly, if you lower interest rates, that doesn't come for free. That just means the lender gets less revenue and the lender is the banking system. So by lowering the debt servicing costs of local governments, you are also lowering the revenues of the banking system. Now, if the banks were independent and independently capitalized, you could argue that there is a real transfer from the banking system to local governments. But even the top banks in China need to be recapitalized. So that leaves them in a bit of a quandary. If you restructure debt in such a way that you are paying less interest to the banks, on the one hand, you're saving money because you're paying less interest. But on the other hand, that's matched almost dollar for dollar by the increase in the amount of recapitalization of the banking system. So once again, you're really shifting money from one pocket to another. You're not changing anything fundamental in the system. OK, understood. That's not the only type of policy that the government has begun to roll out to help support growth. Are there other policies that you think will be effective at supporting the economy from here? There are four other policies, all of them problematic. One is to continue subsidizing manufacturing. In fact, I was at a presentation with a very prominent Chinese economist who's actually quite influential in policymaking circles. And he made what I thought was a rather astonishing statement. He said, we all agree we need to boost consumption, but there is a good way and a bad way. The bad way is to transfer income to the household sector. The good way is to transfer income to businesses so that they expand and hire more workers and raise wages. And that will drive consumption up. Now, the problem is that China doesn't just need more consumption. It needs more consumption relative to production. It's got a huge imbalance. So the idea that the good way to drive up consumption is by driving up production and having part of that flow into consumption gets it completely backwards. But at any rate, that's one of their policies. We have to continue subsidizing the supply side of the economy. That, I would argue, makes the imbalances worse. Another one of their policies is the big problem in China is lack of confidence in the household sector because of the decline in housing prices. So we need to stabilize the housing market. Well, I don't need to tell you that. So far, there's been a lot of talk about doing that, but it hasn't happened. Real estate prices continue to decline. Real estate transactions continue to decline. I'm not sure that there are policies that can prevent the decline in housing prices because the problem in China is we have way too much housing for a declining population. And let me do a quick digression here. We should never talk about China's housing problem. There are two very separate Chinas. There is the China of the southeast, you know, provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Shanghai, Beijing, where you have a problem of excess property, excess housing. But it's not too bad. And those all have growing working populations thanks to immigration. And then you have the rest of China, which has a real problem where most of the excess housing is built up and they all have very rapidly declining working populations. But at any rate, Beijing's strategy is if we can stabilize property prices, we will raise consumer confidence and that will cause consumption to go up. Maybe it'll work. Maybe it won't. The third strategy is related. And that is that if we can get a boost in the stock market, that also will raise consumer confidence and through a wealth effect may cause consumption to go up. I'm very skeptical. The float within the stock market is quite small. Most speculators are pretty rich. So it's not clear there's a big wealth effect and the market is so volatile that I'm not sure that even if you make money on Tuesday, you'll go out and spend it on Wednesday. And then finally, the last strategy is to boost consumption directly through transfers. But the only way they're doing that really is through consumer coupons. There's a few other things they're doing. They are trying to spend more money on students, spend more money on very poor retirees and issue lots of consumer coupons in the hopes that that stimulates consumption. The problem there is that when you add up all of these numbers, they're really tiny. And the reason they're really tiny is because all of the spending doesn't occur at the Beijing level. It's not national spending. It all occurs at the provincial and municipal level and provinces and municipalities have real cash flow constraints. So they're promoting a lot of these programs. But when you actually add them up, the numbers are really tiny. Right. Interesting. And then, of course, you now have the reelection of Donald Trump and the threat and likelihood of more tariffs. How problematic will that be for China? I think China is very worried about that, and I think the rest of the world is very worried about that. China is about 17 percent of global GDP, but it accounts for about 30 percent of global manufacturing. And the Chinese strategy in the last two to three years and longer than that, but especially in the last two to three years, has been to double down on manufacturing growth, which means that ultimately China's share of global manufacturing must grow twice as quickly as China's share of global GDP. Right. The problem is that in the past, the U.S. absorbed most of that. And you can see in the U.S., the manufacturing share has declined pretty steadily since the beginning of the century. The U.S. is about 23 percent of global GDP and only 17 percent of global manufacturing. To reverse that trend and to try to increase the U.S. manufacturing share to something closer to its GDP share, here is the problem. It's just a problem of arithmetic. And that is China and the U.S. together account for nearly 50 percent of global manufacturing. And if they both try to increase their manufacturing shares of GDP, then by definition, the rest of the world has to accommodate by reducing its manufacturing share. But who wants to do that? Nobody. Europe is extremely worried about this and putting into place very strong trade policies that prevent a further erosion of its manufacturing share. So much of that is moved over to developing countries who have seen their own manufacturing badly hurt by the struggle between the two titans. So the problem is that China's solution is the kind of solution that would work 20 or 30 years ago when they were too small to matter. Now that they account for nearly one third of global manufacturing, the solution cannot work without significant accommodation by a very reluctant rest of the world. Right. OK, so is there any policy that you think is likely to be implemented that is going to improve the current situation? In the short term, we're probably going to see an expansion of fiscal support much greater than we've seen already. Probably in the first quarter, we will finally start to see real attempts to stimulate the demand side of the economy. And that will be very positive in the short term. But ultimately, it's only a short term solution. The only sustainable way to rebalance the economy, to increase the consumption share of GDP so that they can reduce the investment share and the trade surplus, involves increasing the share of GDP distributed to the household sector, which is easy to say. But the flip side of that is you have to reduce the share of GDP retained by either governments or businesses. And that's the very hard part to do. So what I'm hearing from both Michael and Hui is that when it comes to the Chinese economy, the problems are much clearer than solutions at this point. So ultimately, the question of just how effective policy stimulus will be in addressing China's economic issues remains an open one. Let's leave it there.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-12-13 05:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### Investing in Sports: Women’s Sports and the Future\n**Episode ID:** 4522\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWhen Willow Bay considered investing in a women's soccer team earlier this year, the decision was easy to make. From serious to purchase was like a blink of an eye. The team in question was the Los Angeles Club of the National Women's Soccer League, or NWSL, Angel City FC. As a longtime L.A. resident, Bay and her family had followed the team since it was formed in 2020. Bay is dean of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and had even taken students from her sports media industries class to see Angel City play. We were such fans and friends of the team and kind of understood them and understood this moment. This moment being the groundswell of enthusiasm for women's sports across college and professional leagues, record attendance at live matches, unprecedented viewership for televised games, and more capital flowing into media rights, corporate sponsorships, and brand endorsements. There have been other movements in women's sports, certainly, but I'm not sure we've seen the audience excitement, the audience demand driving this across so many sports, across so many communities, and across so many cultures. This is Investing in Sports, a four-part series from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast about the changing dynamics at the intersection of sports and finance. I'm Nicole Pullen-Ross, I lead the private wealth management business for the New York region at Goldman Sachs, and I also head our sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management. In our final episode, we're covering the business forces driving growth in women's sports and what all of it means for investors. Later in the show, I'll be speaking with Willow Bay about becoming the controlling owner of a team with the highest recorded valuation of any women's sports franchise. But first, my colleague Stacey Sonnenberg is back in the studio with me. Stacey is head of global sports finance at Goldman Sachs. She has a unique perspective on the evolution of women's sports, having worked with many of the team owners and league officials, raising the capital needed to grow the industry. Stacey, thank you so much for joining me. Thank you for having me. So let's set the scene a little bit. I recently attended a New York Liberty game at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. I'm not sure the last time you were there, but it was filled. I'm not sure if everyone there came to see their mascot, Ellie, the elephant, who is something to see, but it really underscored what is happening in women's sports and something big is happening. The crowd really was not that different than Annette's game in Brooklyn. It was really diverse. There were probably a few more women and girls, but it was pretty extraordinary. To what do you attribute the current momentum we're seeing across all of women's sports? It's an exciting time. I mean, everyone's talking about it. I think that the biggest driver behind the momentum is certainly the athleticism, the talent that we see on the court, on the pitch, on the field. It's extraordinary and can't be understated without the quality of the athleticism. The quality of the play is critically important. I think also you have a shift happening among the corporate sponsorship base as well, who wants to focus their dollars, their sponsorship dollars against women as much as they do men, but it's been harder in the past to have that women's sponsorship area. Sponsors are driving this shift as well. Then with the sponsor interest, that's generating fan interest, and with the fan interest, you generate the media viewership, and that's increasing the media rights. It's not any one thing that's driving the momentum in women's sports. All of these pieces, these disparate pieces coming together at this moment in time and really creating something very special for all of us to witness. There's one more thing. You can't talk about women's sports and not reflect upon the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team. It is a powerhouse team playing tremendous soccer. Frankly, some of the best soccer you see in the United States right now happens on the women's pitches. It's not exciting just for American fans, but for international fans. I think that they deserve tremendous credit for propelling this moment. It feels in some ways that this is an overnight success. We both know that it's not the case. Just think about the fact that the WNBA was started in 1996, 50 years after the NBA. Just take a minute, if you would, to briefly acknowledge the 50-plus year history that has led us to this moment in time, particularly in the U.S. In the United States, Title IX in 1972 was critical to women's sports. I think most people are probably familiar with this, but for schools, whether grade school, high school, colleges who receive federal funding, they had to provide equal opportunity for women in sports, as they did men, and couldn't discriminate on the basis of gender. And so that really created an investment in developing our women athletes and giving them opportunity to grow their skills and have the proper coaching, have the platform from which to develop and grow the true game. And so having that 50 years of investment by our educational system, which really the federal government drove, we can't fail to acknowledge that. But then it didn't stop there. I give a lot of credit to the NBA and what they did with the WNBA and the years of investment they have given to that league to nurture it and bring it to fruition and put their name behind it. Other leagues have supported women's sports, but haven't necessarily put their name behind it. The WNBA has the benefit of that NBA name behind it, and they have invested for 28 years bringing it to where it is today. But I think the other leagues, it's been more fits and starts, right? Lots of trial and error and trying to get it right. It's an evolution. Europe's interesting too, though. Football across Europe, soccer here, but football across Europe, all the big leagues have women's teams and are forming them and very rapidly creating competition for our US women, because our US women are really extraordinary. But certainly in Europe, you see the evolution of women's football growing very rapidly as well and investment happening there. One of the questions that we're hearing from our clients who are often looking for ways not only to fuel their passion, but also to look for investment return, of course. And so we'll have many clients asking us, okay, how do I quantify the value of my passion? How do I quantify what a return on this investment in women's sports might look like? Women's teams valuations are climbing, but they still lag men's team valuations. We can use professional basketball as an example. The average WNBA team is valued at $96 million, while the average NBA team is valued at $3.9 billion. So with all of this in mind, how do you think about the investment opportunity in women's sports? I do believe in my heart women's sports are going to take a fundamentally different path than men's sports did, partly because of the time we're living in, and it's not the same set of historical circumstances. It's a unique moment in time. But I also think women tend to do things a little differently in general, which I think has been great for business, I think will be great for sport. But you can't help but look at the example of what came before and use that as sort of a little bit of a guide. So if you look at the NBA and where the WNBA valuations are relative to the NBA, they're growing at not quite the compounded annual growth rate or CAGR that the NBA's valuations are growing at, but they're growing at a pretty similar CAGR. The NWSL is growing way faster than MLS valuations did. If you use sort of those leagues' growth as a guide, the WNBA and NWSL are well on their way to achieving valuations in, is it 10 years, is it 15 years, is it 20 years, similar to what we see in the NBA and MLS today. And so from that perspective, from the valuation growth perspective, there's real opportunity in these sports in particular. And I'm focusing on the WNBA and WSL because I think that those are the ones that your audience is thinking about the most. But certainly in Europe, you see similar momentum. I think that the other side of it, the ongoing investment, if you buy a club today, it's not going to be you buy a club today and it prints money tomorrow. You buy a club today or you invest in women's sports today, there's an ongoing investment that's required right now to continue to build up that fan base and get the media rights to where the other leagues are. And that's going to take time. And so I think it needs to be patient capital with women's sports, but I think that capital will see a return. Yes, I think that has historically been the type of capital that is invested in sports, patient capital. And I agree with you, that will likely be the expectation going forward, although to your point that the increase in valuation and growth seems to be happening more quickly. Let's talk about the role of media rights. In the WNBA and NWSL, the price of those rights is up considerably. How big a driver of revenues and therefore valuations is media rights? There's so much going on around media rights right now, but it's not simply RWNBA media rights going to go up. Of course they are. How are they going to go up? And I think there is this view of women's sports has lent itself to streaming in a way that's been very natural and part of the evolution of it. And so perhaps investors are thinking about women's sports a little differently when it comes to media rights. And what's fascinating too, especially when it comes to the WNBA, is how the revenues are split between the national revenues and the local revenues. And so in the WNBA, the national revenues has partners that are receiving a portion of them with the NBA and with private equity investors. And so when you're buying a team driving those local revenues, the non-media revenues in many cases is really how you can directly impact that valuation as an owner in the near term. All of which will take capital, which is what I'd like to ask you about next. With this storyline, it should make it a little easier to raise capital. And so as you talk to clients and investors, where do you see teams looking to meaningfully deploy capital? With the WNBA and with the focus on local revenues or how you can differentiate yourself, you're seeing the investment in facilities, right? So Mark Davis, when he came in and bought the Aces and invested in a training facility, a real training facility, world-class. It set a new standard. Kansas City Current, building their stadium, their own home stadium to be able to control their fans, their fans' experience. So I think you're going to see more of that investment across facilities, across both of those leagues. And frankly, around the world, as you know, we work closely with FC Barcelona and they built a new stadium that their women's team plays in, Johan Cruyff Stadium. And so it's a great facility. And now the women, though, need to actually play in camp. No, because they can sell it out, which is exciting. So you'll see investment in facilities. This shift of media to direct-to-consumer requires tremendous investment by the leagues, and the leagues have to do that as well. And so that's going to continue to be an area of investment. And then the third leg of the revenue stool is sponsorships and how to interact with sponsors. How do you really provide them true activation opportunities? That evolves and requires investment as well. You can't have a conversation about women's sports and not talk about the star power of this year's WNBA rookies and what they've brought to the game, especially Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. I mean, it's just so extraordinary to watch these women. And they're stars. They are. They're total stars. I mean, Thomas Edison had Nikola Tesla, and there's always two brilliant people at the same time coming into their own and getting to witness that is so exciting. It's driving attendance. It's driving viewership. People are talking about it. People are following it. Clearly, we all watched women's college games in a way that we had not in many years. And we saw the numbers. Many more people were watching the women's finals games because of that enthusiasm. So I want to talk a little bit about name, image, and likeness. The NIL legislation that has allowed college players to make money from the use of their name, image, and likeness that's been in place now for a few years. It's complicated legislation. There are some meaningful opportunities that's unlocked for college athletes. But it also amplifies the real significant need for financial education. For example, understanding the after-tax value of some of these contracts. I'd love to hear any perspective that you have to share about what NIL has meant for the superstar player as they've come into the professional leagues. So NIL's been a game changer for women in particular, I think, and provided them opportunities that really have enabled them to thrive. I am not an expert in it by any stretch of the imagination. I don't really know that anyone is because the rollout's been very messy. No one really has clarity on rules or how it works. And it seems like there's opportunity for athletes to be harmed with it too. So it's been messy. But it certainly has provided a greater access to these athletes through the sponsorship, more visibility in our lives. And so I think it's been tremendous to accelerating this moment for women's sports and really turning it into not just a moment, but a movement. And it's exciting. I was at my son's rugby game and there all day, but I was wearing a t-shirt that says everyone watches women's sports. And the number of people, men and women, who wanted to high-five me at that, I think, speaks to where we're seeing activity and enthusiasm, and to your point, really a movement. Yeah. And so we've spent a lot of time talking about the two places, as you mentioned, that a lot of investors are focused on, the WNBA and the NWSL. But there are several other sports like rugby. Tell me a little bit about what you're hearing from clients or other investors about women's sports or leagues that are in their nascency but of growing interest. Yeah. So it's interesting. Last week, I had a call with a client who said, OK, we know about WNBA and NWSL. We're very excited about both. What are the ones we don't know about that we should be looking at? And it was such an interesting question. Certainly hockey has been one that's tried and failed a few different times and is trying again. But volleyball, rugby, as you mentioned, flag football, there's all these areas that women are playing sport and playing it well, and people want to watch it. I'm so excited about flag football. Yes. As you know, it's going to be in the Olympics for the first time in 2028, which is just incredible. And the number of girls participating is up meaningfully, up 63% from 2019. So 500,000 girls participated in flag football in 2023, which I think is so awesome. And then we're also starting to see private equity interest in the space. We saw in March that Josh Harris and David Blitzer backed Unrivaled Sports by acquiring a national youth flag football league under the lights. So again, I think those trends and themes around youth sports, women's sports, flag football, lots of interesting activity on the horizon for sure. This has been incredibly fun and informative. Thank you for being such a beacon in this space and for sharing your time today. Any closing thoughts before we wrap? I'm just excited to see what happens next. This is a fun space to watch. We're really lucky to get to witness it and hopefully help drive it forward. Absolutely. Thank you, Stacey. Thank you. One team gained a lot of attention for driving women's soccer forward when it was formed in 2020. With a star-studded ownership group led by big names in venture capital and in Hollywood, Angel City FC was pitched more like an ambitious startup than a traditional team. And like many ambitious startups, the team valuation climbed as it posted record attendance and earned record revenues. Willow Bay and her husband, Bob Iger, who is the CEO of Walt Disney, saw an opportunity to further grow the team and the league. In July, they became the new controlling owners of the LA Club in a deal that valued Angel City at $250 million. As part of the new ownership, Bay now chairs the Angel City board and serves on the league's board of governors. I sat down for such an exciting conversation with Willow on the day the deal closed to ask her about becoming the team's controlling owner during what feels like a revolution in women's sports. Willow, thank you so much for joining me. Thanks, Nicole, for having me and welcome to The Revolution. Thank you. I want to start from the beginning. I want to talk a little bit about your connection to Angel City FC. I know it predates investing in the team. It was your local women's soccer team. What did the team mean to you as a fan? We followed this team from its inception, from the very beginning. We were friendly with the co-founders. We watched the story unfold in the press. We went to games. We took our kids and grandkids to games. I was always interested in kind of the business story. Watching this startup explode onto the scene and really challenge all notions about what it meant to begin anew, to challenge expectations, to defy expectations, and to grow exponentially. I would bring students, my Annenberg students as part of a sports class that I teach in the summer, to go visit the team each May. Each May, it offered a really interesting snapshot into where they were on this journey. Interestingly, I wasn't thinking about it at the time, but I actually had a closer window into their business development and business trajectory along with their mission, vision, and values than I think most fans and friends from the neighborhood would. I wonder what about this time is different as it relates to women's sports. You've witnessed previous waves of enthusiasm in women's sports as a broadcast journalist, including the launch of the WNBA in 1996, which feels like not so long ago and really long ago at the same time. What do you think about this current moment? I'll start close to home with the team experience. Something that struck me as different when we'd go to games or take our family to games was the in-stadium experience. There's an expression called collective effervescence, and it's a great expression to describe the feeling of joy that comes when people gather together around a shared experience. It may sound corny, but that's really what you feel when you go see an Angel City game, when you go see a women's soccer game. And so this cultural conversation that we're having right now around women's sports and interest and excitement around women's sports really has just been ignited locally, close to home, nationally, and certainly globally. The Olympics took the conversation up a notch on a global stage and particularly where women athletes are concerned. The first Olympics to have parody in terms of men and women competing, and we all know how that went. The stories of women captivated us. The women athletes were just extraordinary. You have that juxtaposed against Caitlyn Clark, also just igniting fan excitement across the WNBA and the WNBA as a league, also growing steadily year by year, setting new records with a media deal. And so I think this is driven by audiences. They are clamoring for more. And I'm not sure that we have seen, there have been other movements in women's sports, certainly, but I'm not sure we've seen the audience excitement, the audience demand driving this across so many sports, across so many communities, and across so many cultures. And let's think about that in the context of your decision to buy Angel City. Walk us through that process a little bit. When did you begin seriously entertaining the idea of an investment in the team? Okay, I'm kind of chuckling right now because from serious to purchase was like a blink of an eye, in part because we were such fans and friends of the team and kind of understood them and understood this moment. Much of the decision was based on instinct. I truly said to Bob, I just heard that Angel City is engaging in a process with bankers to sell a controlling share. Are you interested? And he looked at me and said, yes. And we were truly off to the races. So, you know, in some ways, this was quite literally the golden opportunity that was right in our backyard. And when you think of how special the team is, it's a bit of an IQ test, right? There's an extraordinary asset, but also an extraordinary set of values and the ultimate in purpose-driven brands and a sports enterprise that ignores any notion of a glass ceiling, any limit on the value of the team, the value of the sport, the value of women along any dimension. And so through that process, you now have added to your resume, Willow Bay, the controlling owner. Tell me about how you're feeling about your role as a controlling owner going forward. You know, when I think about assuming the role of control owner, I think about that in the context of a very different structure than the team started. It was a startup. It was very much designed like a tech startup and designed for speed, designed for boldness, designed for a whole lot of really important things. I think now with this new structure, it offers us an opportunity to align capital and governance in the ownership structure in a way that I hope will sustain and actually accelerate the growth, but really help provide a sustainable foundation for the team going forward. You know, when I also look at the league, because the interesting thing about owning a team is you have competitors who are also your collaborators because you really work on building this league together and creating a thriving, sustainable future for successive generations of players and team owners. And by the way, the NWSL is the fastest growing league in the world right now as well. So you have those trajectories very much in parallel, but the way I'm looking at it, this really requires bringing your A game. Sounds like you're up for it. I want to spend a minute on the naysayers. I assume even in a short period of time, as you were deciding on the investment, there were individuals who may not see things as you've seen them. What did they say? Anyone who discouraged you? What sort of things did you hear? Yeah, I think there were what I'll call sort of two veins of discouraging advice. I would say the bulk of the advice was encouraging, by the way. But one was just the valuation was very, very high. And then related to that, the idea that, you know, Angel City being the most valuable franchise in the league and the range of valuations is quite significant. And so the argument against investing was, well, you don't want to buy the most expensive house in what they considered a not so nice neighborhood. And needless to say, that was not an investment thesis we agreed with. I'm curious, when you define success for your Angel City investment, do you think about that success in terms of return, impact? What will success look like for you? I think success is first and foremost impact. What kind of impact we can have as this team grows and truly becomes, I mean, it's already iconic, but truly becomes embedded in sports history as exceptional and drives equity for women across the industry of sports and certainly for players, for athletes. So impact number one, and obviously we are determined to grow the enterprise value and work closely with the team and the league to make sure not just Angel City's enterprise value is growing, but so are the other teams that participate in this league. I'd love to drill down on that growth concept as it relates to this investment. What are you considering as potential drivers of growth, possible monetization for the team and for the league? I think when you look across all dimensions of what drives enterprise value, there are gaps that I think need to be explored and closed, frankly. So when you think about, first of all, it begins with women's sports audience is unique in that women's sports fans tend to be very diverse, more educated and somewhat more affluent audience. They spend money and it's a growing and very engaged community. So how do we think about continuing to engage with them in meaningful ways and capturing more of their time and attention? I think that's a real opportunity. Thinking about the ways players engage with these fans, with social media playing the role that it does today in particular, that typically is an advantage for women in building connection with fans and connection across audiences. Merchandise and apparel. Women buy more sports merchandise than men, yet they are underserved in the current marketplace by a nine to one margin. That alone is a significant gap that I think we could address and you can drill down. I'm just beginning to learn about this, but you can really drill down and look at supply issues, disparities in skew counts. For example, sponsorship, another area where there's a massive gap. I haven't even talked about media exposure. The league just did a new four year deal, $240 million across several metrics. But we know that that audience is going to continue to grow as well. So we think there's, again, there's more opportunity there. Well, this is a very exciting start. So we'll take it as a part one for sure, but impressed by the work that you're doing and the leadership that you're already demonstrating. And so thank you for the opportunity to learn about your perspective, to get a sneak peek into the enthusiasm that for sure will be part of the Angel City story going forward. Is there anything that we haven't talked about that we should before I let you go? Yeah, I think one of the things that the Angel City founders have done really, really well is tell the story of this team and define this brand. I think it's been remarkable and clearly fans and audiences have engaged and connected to it in deep and meaningful ways. You see that locally, but you also see it in terms of the international reach, where I think we have some work to do and that we're going to get started on is making sure that all of the aspects of this team enterprise have the same amount of attention and support. And I'm thinking very specifically of our players. I think we need to really think deeply and work harder to make sure that we are supporting them in their pursuit of excellence on the pitch and in pursuit of like fully developed and meaningful professional lives, which include work on the pitch and work off the pitch. And I think for me, it's a real opportunity to look at the soccer house and look at our incredible athletes around whom this team has been built, around whom this sport is being built and make sure they have what they need to really soar. Well, I think if the new collective bargaining agreement that the league and the players agreed to earlier this year is an early indication of the success and progress you've already made, I think there's a lot to look forward to. So thank you for your focus. Thank you. And by the way, please come to a game. Oh, I would love to. Great. Thank you for your time. Thank you.

So what are investors expecting from the second Trump administration? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Here with me today is David Miracle, Chief U.S. Economist with Goldman Sachs Research. David, welcome back to the program. Thank you very much, Alison. So obviously we've seen a very positive market reaction post the election of Donald Trump, at least in U.S. equities. But here at Goldman Sachs, we took the initiative to actually try to survey investors to see what they are expecting. So before we get into the findings of that survey, talk to us a little bit about the survey, how you made it, who did it go to, give us some details. Sure, so we have our own policy expectations for what might change under the second Trump administration, but we wanted to understand what are investors thinking, what assumptions underlie market pricing. And so in conjunction with our marquee team, we surveyed over 500 people, and we asked them about the whole range of issues that we think are most macroeconomically significant, immigration policy, trade policy, and fiscal policy, to try to get a sense of, are they looking for more or less the same policy changes as us, or where might views differ? And so what are investors most nervous about in that survey? So we actually asked this question, which of the potential policy changes worry you the most in terms of their macroeconomic consequences for 2025? The runaway winner with 60% of the vote was the prospect of a universal 10 or 20% tariff on all goods from all countries. That's not our baseline, it's not most investors' baseline either, but that was cited as the top risk. Other big risks, which came in quite a bit lower on the ranking, were concerns about fiscal sustainability being triggered by some sort of fiscal move, or concerns about deportations of unauthorized immigrants having a negative effect on growth and a positive effect on wages and inflation. Trump already announced 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada. I don't think we were expecting that. Were investors expecting that, or they might be nervous about the universal tariff? Are they actually expecting a universal tariff? No, so we asked two questions. First, what was your baseline expectation for the combination of tariffs we might see? And second, what probability do you put on that universal tariff? Most investors are looking for basically what we're looking for, some additional tariffs on imports from China and some additional imports on autos, because autos, as we've seen in the recent election, is a very politically sensitive industry. There is a substantial minority of investors who said that their baseline also includes some version of the universal tariff, all goods from all countries, but that was not the modal view, at the very least. Now, in the follow-up question, where we asked what probability would you put on a universal tariff, the average response was 35%. So a little bit below our own 40%. And I think that just captures this is a serious proposal and it is a serious risk, and that's why people are very focused on it, but it's not the modal view in markets. But even that 25% announcement was unexpected and important. Yeah, it's a thread. It's not yet been implemented. There were a lot of things that were proposed at one point during the first Trump administration that didn't get fully enacted. So I think still not part of our baseline of those 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will go into effect, but I imagine we'll hear a lot of proposals like this along the way. Interesting. So obviously, immigration policy is also at the top of Trump's list. It's on investors' minds, as you said. Trump's been quite vocal about wanting to tighten immigration policy. So what are investors expecting and how does that compare to what we are expecting on immigration policy? Sure, let me just give a little bit of background because we included this question in part because it's an important policy issue for the president-elect, but also because it has been an important macroeconomic issue for the U.S. over the course of the last couple of years. Pre-pandemic, total net immigration, unauthorized plus authorized, into the U.S. was about a million a year. Little bit higher sometimes, little bit lower sometimes. Nothing too dramatic. Higher typically when the U.S. economy is booming and jobs are readily available. Lower, for example, after 2008, when if you come here, you're certainly not guaranteed to get a job. Now in 2023, net immigration was about, we think, three million into the U.S. So triple what it would have been in a normal year. At the very peak in late 2023, the annualized rate got up to about three and a half to four million. We've already seen that come down very sharply to an annualized rate of about 1.75 million. So it is already, even before Trump takes office, been roughly cut in half. So that's just a little bit of background to help you make sense of the numbers. Now we're assuming that under the second Trump administration, net immigration will average, and this is total, authorized plus unauthorized, will average about 750,000 a year. Relative to 2023, a lot lower. Relative to the pre-pandemic norm, a little bit lower, but not dramatically lower. It turns out that's also what most investors expect. The most frequent answer from about half of the people we polled was half a million to one million, and then the vast majority of people were either in the bucket just below that or just above that. Only about 6% of poll respondents expected net immigration to turn negative. Now one thing that trips people up is that they read in the news about deportations and they say, oh, so you don't expect deportations. I think everybody does. There are always some deportations of unauthorized immigrants taking place. Those will probably be at the high end of the range we've seen over recent presidential administrations, if not a bit higher. But bear in mind, there's always probably some inevitable inflow of unauthorized immigrants and authorized immigration amounts to about 750,000 a year. So our estimate and the median investor's estimate would suggest maybe authorized immigration stays roughly unchanged. The unauthorized part gets down to about net zero. Interesting, okay. So 750 is all authorized essentially in our expectations. Exactly, and again, it's a big change relative to 2023. It's not necessarily a big change relative to what we saw in the pre-pandemic decades. Let's talk tax cuts. I think it's widely expected that the 2017 tax cuts are going to continue, but what else are investors expecting on top of that? Are they more optimistic that we'll see more tax cuts? So nearly everyone expects the 2017 tax cuts to be extended. About 2 3rds of our survey respondents expected them to be extended in full. About 1 3rd expected them to be extended in part. Now, above and beyond that, there are a bunch of other potential tax cuts because there were a lot of proposals that were brought up during the campaign. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security, and various other proposals like this. There are also some that are always part of the discussion, like increasing the state and local tax deduction. Our assumption, and this turns out to also be the assumption of most investors, is that there will be some additional tax cuts, but that they won't be huge in size. So we're assuming something like 0.2% of GDP, or about $60 billion in additional tax cuts, because we suspect that Republicans would be concerned that if they don't deliver on some of the campaign proposals, that would antagonize voters and would cost them in the next election. Why not something even bigger? Why not the full-blown tax cut agenda? To my mind, the main reason for that is that the starting point for US fiscal sustainability is very different and a lot more concerning than the first time that Trump took office. We already have a primary, or X interest federal fiscal deficit, that is about 5% of GDP, wider than it has historically been when the economy has been equally strong and the unemployment rate's been around 4%. We have a debt-to-GDP ratio that is quickly closing in on a new all-time high. And the thing that arguably gets us into the most trouble of all, we now have interest rates across the curve that are about double what most people were assuming the last time President-elect Trump was in office. As you take all of those things together, it makes for a not great outlook for the debt-to-GDP ratio, for interest expense as a share of GDP. And I think that will probably constrain what Congress is willing to do in terms of further unfunded tax cuts or spending increases. Something to make good on campaign proposals, but not enough to really shake up the macroeconomic picture. That's our view, and that turned out to also be most investors' view. Let me just ask a quick follow-up question on corporate taxes. Are investors expecting corporate tax cuts? That was such a big policy shift when Trump first came into office. Yeah, so many were, although I guess I would caution that could mean different things to different people. So maybe we should have phrased this question a little bit better. Last time Trump was in office, there were proposals to lower the corporate tax rate all the way down to 15%. They lowered it to 21%. We think it's very unlikely that will go all the way to 15%. So if that's what people had in mind, I guess I'd say we disagree with that. But it is possible it could be reduced to 20%. And we also think it's pretty likely that the manufacturing tax rate, that specifically could come down to 15%. That's not the entire economy, that's just one sector. But that part we think is plausible. A lot of people did expect further corporate tax rate cuts, but that could have meant something more substantial or more moderate. And if people meant more moderate, then I would say I think that's reasonable. So in the context of these fiscal issues that we're already facing, obviously there's a lot of focus on the other side of the ledger in terms of government spending, and there is this new government efficiency department. We don't really know what that's gonna look like at this point. What are investors expecting from that? And what are you expecting from that given how new that initiative is? I would say this is definitely the question where people had the least sense of what to make of it, where views were the most widely varied. Answers were really pretty spread out. I would say a lot of people, probably about 45% of people expected either insignificant cuts or quite small cuts. That probably aligns most closely with our view. Beyond that, it was not a popular view that this would save a huge amount of money, but I would say that it was maybe 10% of the survey response in each of several buckets from 25 to 100 billion, 100 to 200 billion, 200 to 300, 300 and above. So wide ranging views understandable for something that's so new. And you've actually pointed out that there are some real limits to cutting spending. Tell us about that. I think if you're not interested in cutting defense spending and you're not interested in cutting entitlement spending, then certainly getting to the kinds of numbers that they've been talking about seems very unlikely. But the remaining part, I think it would be more challenging to cut an amount that's substantial enough to really have a large macroeconomic impact. So that's the policy expectations. How does this all read through to inflation? Sure. So on inflation, I think by far the most important policy is tariffs. Now I would emphasize that tariffs are a one-time effect on the price level, but just in terms and therefore a one-time inflationary effect, but just quantitatively in terms of the impact on prices next year, I think that's likely to be much more significant than changes to fiscal and immigration policy. Under our baseline, where we get further tariffs on imports from China at an average rate of 20 percentage points or an average increase of 20 percentage point, plus some additional tariffs on autos, most likely from the EU, we think that would raise the US's effective or average realized tariff rate by three to four percentage points. Now we've run this experiment before, of course, during Trump's first term. And we've looked back at the lessons learned from the impact of tariffs on prices back then. And our rule of thumb is that every one point increase in the effective tariff rate is worth about one-tenth of a percentage point on the price level. If we get the policies we're looking for in our baseline, that three to four percentage point increase would be worth three to four-tenths on the price level. And if that all happens pretty quickly, as it probably would, that would mean at the peak, you get a three to four-tenths boost to inflation. That's not huge. It shouldn't be that hard to say, at least in the case of the consumer tariffs, this is roughly the effect of the tariff. And we know that by comparing tariffed items to non-tariffed items, and the inflation boost would come on top of an underlying trend that we think would otherwise be declining from the high twos to the low twos. So this would cause us to wind up more in the mid twos than the low twos, but certainly not to take us back to the levels that we saw in prior years. Now, if we do get the universal tariff, the impact of that on the average tariff rate is about triple the impact of the other two policies combined. So that gives you a good sense of why this is the key risk, the key wild card for 2025. It's simply much larger than the other tariff policies we're talking about. And the impact of that on prices would also be roughly triple. We think that would raise the price level by about 1% and probably push inflation at the peak a little bit above 3%. Although again, I would emphasize this is still a one-time effect. And how about economic growth? In terms of the impact on growth, the impact of the policy changes that we've talked about today, we think on a two to three-year horizon would be roughly offsetting. The catch is that the things that would have a negative impact on GDP, namely just fewer immigrants, fewer workers, and tariffs, those can be done more through the White House's authority. So that could happen more quickly. Whereas the things that would have a positive impact on GDP, namely the tax cuts, that has to go through Congress. So that's not going to happen as quickly. That probably means that in 2025, you get more of the negative effects. In 2026, you get more of the positive effects. But on a multi-year horizon, we would say these things are roughly offsetting, that they don't really substantially change the growth trajectory of the US economy. And so we think about the implications of this for the Fed, our views versus investors' expectations. Are we differentiated? I think this is probably where our views differ the most. On policies, what I learned from doing this survey is that actually the market consensus is pretty close to our view on what will actually happen. Where I think we differ is on the assumption, the inference that many investors seem to make, that tariffs mean higher inflation and therefore higher interest rates. Obviously, there's a lot of appeal to that logic. I just think that the risks are a little bit more two-sided than people are appreciating. And I say that for three reasons. First, if we get the tariffs we have in our baseline, again, the impact on inflation is just not that big. We're talking about 30 to 40 basis points. It would be on top of a otherwise falling underlying trend and the effects should be pretty discernible in the category level details. Second point I would make is, this is clearly a one-time price level effect. So at some level, the central bank is not supposed to respond unless this really unsettles inflation psychology or inflation expectations. And if we're talking about inflation actually coming down from where it is on net now, just coming down less, it's not clear why that would unsettle inflation expectations. The third point I would make is that the assumption that tariffs mean higher interest rates, that's exactly the opposite of what happened in 2019. The last time that the first Trump administration imposed tariffs, the equity market really didn't take it well. Financial conditions tightened quite a bit and the Fed decided to prioritize the risk to growth from a tightening in financial conditions, the risk to the labor market from that tightening in financial conditions over the impact of a moderate one-time price level increase. Some things are different. The rate of inflation is higher now than it was back then, of course. The threatened tariffs are probably larger than they were back then. It's not clear to me that the risks are as one-sided as people think. So I would say in the very near term, we're expecting the Fed to cut in December. I think it's a little bit ambiguous what they'll do immediately after that. We have additional consecutive cuts in our forecast for Q1. Recent Fed commentary suggests they're thinking about trying to find the right point in time to slow the pace of cutting. Could be when we're forecasting, could be a little bit earlier. But I am comfortable with the message from our Fed forecast relative to market pricing that market pricing looks a little bit too hawkish. And I think expectations about the economic and monetary policy consequences of the policy changes that we've discussed today is probably at the heart of the disagreement. Most people take fewer immigrants, tax cuts, tariffs to be inflationary and therefore imply higher rates. There is, of course, some logic to all of that that does make a good amount of sense. But I would just say the consequences to us look like they are not big enough that it would be prohibitive for the Fed to cut. And I think people are underweighting the potential risks to the downside, to the economy and to markets that could trigger another episode comparable to the 2019 insurance cuts when the Fed basically said we're not in a recession yet, but there is a substantial risk to the economy that we want to counteract by easing monetary policy a little bit. In other words, providing insurance against a further downturn. And that risk should really be reflected in market pricing too. So our views are a bit more dovish than market pricing and over the medium term, I'm quite comfortable with that message. David, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you very much for having me.

We were in a building that had two other, you know, major sports teams that were playing at the same time as we were, another basketball team and an NHL hockey team. That's Clippers president of business operations, Gillian Zucker. The hockey team, the L.A. Kings. And the other basketball team, it was the L.A. Lakers. And so we were the third tenant in the building. You get the dates that are remaining. That's nobody's fault, but it was just the reality of what it was like to be the Clippers in that building. This meant the Clippers played dates that weren't favorable for the team, its players, or its fans. We played a lot of day games. We played a lot of Monday nights. We played a lot of holidays that were difficult. We had more difficult road schedules and road trips. We had more back-to-backs than other teams. And as a result of it, we were at a competitive disadvantage and we were at a financial disadvantage. So when you think about being in somebody else's building, you're paying rent to them. They're keeping the suite revenue. They have competing sponsors to you. All of those things go away when you have a place that's all your own. This is Investing in Sports, a four-part series from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast about the changing dynamics at the intersection of sports and finance. I'm Nicole Pullen-Ross. I lead the Private Wealth Management business for the New York region at Goldman Sachs. And I also head our sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management. The LA Clippers just kicked off the NBA season in their brand new home, the Intuit Dome. At $2.4 billion, it's the most expensive arena in the world and part of a trend of new sports entertainment complexes that offer much more for fans to do than simply watch a live game. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has Michelin star level dining, and you can go and have a multi-course wine paired meal before a match. On this episode, we're looking at what it takes to build these stadiums and arenas of the future. We'll hear from Gillian Zucker about designing a new facility with Clippers fans top of mind. We just kept adding more restrooms and more concessions facilities until we felt like we were able to accommodate if we had basically 60% of the section get up at the same time and try to do that at once. Then I'll sit down with my two colleagues who have blazed the trail in stadium finance, Greg Carey, our global co-head of sports investment banking, and Stacey Sonnenberg, head of global sports finance. We'll talk about what's driving interest in the new sports entertainment complexes, the creative new ways of financing these expensive infrastructure projects, and what it all means for teams and their fans. The Intuit Dome is just the arena on steroids, phenomenal, phenomenal facility and just this next mark. People want to feel they're going to a safe, wonderful, and they walk out with a big smile on their face no matter what happens on the court or the pitch or the field. Gillian, welcome. Thank you so much for being with us today. Well, thank you so much. So let's jump right in. The Dome officially opened on August 15th, and by the time our listeners hear this conversation, the Clippers will have had their first few home games of the season in this new arena. To start, will you just paint a picture of the space for our listeners, especially lingering on the features that are most unique to what you and team owner and chairman Steve Ballmer have created? You know, when I think back to when we first started envisioning what the new home of the Clippers would be like, Steve was very, very focused on the basketball. This was going to be a basketball mecca. It was going to be all about the game. And we spent, I can't even tell you how many hours. He obsessed over the bowl. And we were asked questions by our architects, do you want a tight, intimate environment where people can feel the energy of each other? Or do you want some of the more modern bells and whistles and luxuries that come with modern arenas? And his answer to that was, yes, I do. I want that. And they said, no, no, no, you need to choose. And he was like, no, that's why I hired you. And he really, I think, speaks for fans, which is they want it all. And from security to the ticket taking, we wanted it to feel like magic. We wanted it to be easy, we wanted it to be frictionless. And so a lot of the vision of the technology that we brought in is to create an environment that allows for that, that you just walk through all of these spaces. And whether you're going to a concession stand to grab whatever you want and walk out, whether you're using a restroom, that there are a lot of them, and we're trying to make them convenient to where you would want to find them. And then when you get into the facility itself, to be able to have this intense, exciting environment, but yet all of the luxuries and technologies that somebody might dream of. Yeah, I heard from someone who was there recently that you can get from the restroom to your seat in a record amount of time, regardless of where you're sitting. So I think that has certainly resonated. We've done a lot of pedestrian modeling around what people do during games. So they get up, they go to the restroom, then they go to a concession stand, they grab something, popcorn, a drink, whatever it is, and then they go back to their seat. And what everybody's goal is, is if it's a concert, they don't want to miss a song to do that. If it's a basketball game, they don't want to miss a play. So we just kept adding more restrooms and more concessions facilities until we felt like we were able to accommodate if we had basically 60% of the section get up at the same time and try to do that at once, which is the experience you'd have at, say, a halftime or intermission. Okay. So with that in mind, if you take the arena design and then think about what happens when fans enter the building, tell us how you thought about creating that fan experience. What is that like there? To us, everyone who's coming in here is a VIP. I mean, if you think about it, there will be people who save and will attend one game maybe in their entire life. And that is a very, very special experience for them. And you might compare it to somebody who may be sitting in a much more expensive seat, but they may have gotten it through their company who gives them the tickets all the time. So we sort of looked through that lens at every experience and said, how do we exceed expectations in every seat for every person who's coming in to the best of our capabilities? So one of the things that we ask fans to do is to participate in our Game Face ID system. So essentially they can take a selfie of themselves as part of their app downloads when they're getting their ticket. And if they do that, they're literally able to just walk into the arena. They just come through the Game Face ID line and their ticket is automatically taken by our Zoom through device, which knows who they are. And we have guest services people who are there, and sometimes people look around and they're not sure. And they're like, hi, Jim. Come on in. And he's like, oh my god, you know my name. So fans have really been delighted by it. How do you think about the lifetime value of a fan? How does that perspective shape the decisions that the team is making today? We think about that a lot. We also think about the fact that the lifetime value in the past of a Clippers fan and the lifetime value in the future beginning now of a Clippers fan will change dramatically. And it's for a lot of reasons. I mean, for the first time, we control our own concessions. We've entered into a partnership, a collaboration with Levy Restaurants and formed our own group called 310 Provisions. And they run all the concessions and catering across the entire building. And one of the things that they came to us and said is when you're thinking about a building, the quality of the food will be directly proportionate to where your pantry and your kitchen is. So if it's close to the pantry and close to the kitchen, it's going to be higher quality than if it's further. And so we made this crazy decision to build a kitchen inside every concession stand so that the food is made where it's served. Now, nearly everything that's in there, all of these things are made right where they're served. And as a result of that, certainly we're seeing a different level of interest in concessions than you might see at an arena typically. So these types of things are things that increase the lifetime value of the fan, but also provide a much better experience for fans. You've accomplished a lot in what, from the outside, feels like a relatively short period of time, which I'm sure is not how it feels from your seat. But as you think about what's left on the to-do list, is there anything top of mind as you're getting into the season now? We're just getting started. I mean, this building is obviously a meteoric step in the history of the Clippers and our culture, but I really do feel like this is just the beginning. Well, I cannot wait for my first visit, and I'm hoping you all have a really fantastic season and wish you the best. Thank you for being with us. Thank you so much. These impressive new facilities with expanded amenities are expensive to build. The Intuit Dome costs more than $2 billion. A football stadium could cost as much as $5 billion. But for team owners, investing in a new stadium or arena development project today means an opportunity to capture more of the revenue once these facilities are open to fans. My colleagues, Greg Carey and Stacey Sonnenberg, have created some of the most innovative structures to finance these infrastructure projects. They work closely with both team owners and project investors. I'm thrilled to speak with both of them today. Greg, Stacey, welcome. Thank you. Thanks, Nicole. Great to see you. Okay, Greg, we're going to start with you. You have been a trailblazer in the world of stadium finance. We just heard from Gillian Zucker about all the amenities in the new Intuit Dome. I'd like to start our conversation going way back to a couple of decades ago and talking about the project that really changed the narrative of what a stadium or an arena could be, the home of the New England Patriots, the NFL team. What made this project so unique at the time? Well, it was a really interesting time. We're now going back 25 years ago when we started working on it. The Patriots played in Foxborough Stadium, which was worse than the high school football stadium I played in. One night, Jonathan Kraft came and we had dinner and said, could we do a stadium on all privately financed stadium, 100% with no public money in the bowl? I said, sure. Off we went. That stadium cost $450 million. I ended up working on a financing for $300 million, but it was the cornerstone. What Robert and Jonathan Kraft did there, not only did they own the 330 acres, so they created an entity called Patriot Place after the stadium opened. That really was the forerunner, the vision that Robert and his son Jonathan and the family had was they were the anchor tenant. They were the seers of the old days. They were creating this flow and capturing that flow. It's incredible to see how much things have expanded since then. Stacey, I want to turn to you for a moment. You've had a unique perspective on sports infrastructure projects, having begun your career as a civil engineer for New York City's Parks and Recreation Department, which included oversight of the Yankee Stadium. Coming up where Greg left off, how has the scale of stadium and arena infrastructure projects evolved since then? It's so interesting because Greg was the source behind the innovation of stadium finance that we saw evolving for the next 25 years with doing true project finance, where the revenues generated by the building, the yet-to-be-built building, those revenues are the source of repayment for the debt. In order to maximize those revenues, that's been critical to the evolution of stadium design and what does each market really demand. So what we've seen evolve in the buildings is new and innovative premium spaces that are targeting people who are going to spend a lot of money in the building, but also activities and things for children. And so, you see that a section of the outfield might have a zipline or it'll have a playground or merry-go-round or something to make sure the next generation wants to spend time in the building as well. And then the other piece is, how do people consume and how do they want to eat? And so, having a variety of dining options, not just a hot dog stand, but some stadiums like Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has fine dining, Michelin star level dining, and you can go and have a multi-course wine-paired meal before a match, which is just – It's a gift. It's amazing. You also have, at Sacramento Kings, they're fortunate of where they're located, but they have a whole farm-to-table concept within the building. And so, 90% of the food is sourced from within 95 miles of the building. Napa's within that. So they're very fortunate. But you just have a whole new way of people enjoying these buildings. And so, the design has completely evolved. And now, you don't just go there for the game. You want to get there before the game. Hopefully, your team wins. You want to stay after the game. And then, that's where you have, at an LAFC, the sunset deck becomes a place after the match. People hang out at the LAFC sunset deck until 2 in the morning sometimes, just enjoying the views. One of the themes that runs through all of those examples is this concept around community. We hear from so many of our clients who are team owners, they talk about the importance of community. One even said that instead of calling themselves a team owner, they prefer to call themselves stewards of community businesses. From that standpoint, Stacey, how has the role of the stadium or arena played in the community changing? Yeah. Arenas, we talk about all the time, are engines for economic development. They really drive this whole velocity around them. And you look at what Barclays Center did for downtown Brooklyn, and how it didn't just affect where it's located, but that whole area has become so much more vibrant. It already was on its way. Barclays Center just turbocharged that. The Deer District around the Milwaukee Bucks, where that had been sort of a dead zone, and now it's become a lively place people want to go to. But when you think about stadiums and arenas, they generate a ton of jobs. And so all of these projects now have efforts to do apprenticeship and to help local people get jobs, train for jobs, build companies. And so that becomes a big part of these projects as well. They're trying to do more than just be about their game, but really give back to the community in that way. That's great. It's really wonderful to see that full integration. Greg, I want to talk a little bit about what you think has driven the shift and what these buildings or complexes are used for and what they have to offer. What's the need or the opportunity that team owners are really responding to? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, most of these buildings go back to the 60s and 70s. They were all multi-use, like football and baseball all played in the same thing. So the seating design, the government owned them, a lot of deferred maintenance. These buildings were not very well kept up because the governments really weren't making a lot of money from it. The teams weren't making a lot of money from it. But as you start to look at the future of what is going on, you look at the U.S. Bank of Michigan, which is the Minnesota Vikings, they'll now have Final Fours there. They'll have Super Bowls there. They now have concerts. And so if you think about an arena, an arena will do as much as 200 dates a year. Madison Square Garden does 300 dates a year. It's interesting, when we financed for the Giants MetLife Stadium, the Jets and the Giants were the 16th and 17th most valuable teams. And this was New York. But they didn't control their building. State of New Jersey got a third of everything. They ran the ticketing. They ran the programming. The Jets and the Giants both borrowed in excess of $800 million each back then. This is, we're talking 2007. And they became the fourth and fifth most valuable teams, spending money to make money. They then controlled the programming of the building. The championship of the World Cup will be at MetLife Stadium coming up. So it's the ability to do many things, but controlling that building. The ability, why professional owners want to basically run that building, they're going to run it professionally. They're going to be able to provide the services necessary to the clients. But it's also that they can monetize that building so they can put a better team on the field and then compete. Yeah. It's interesting because you see that factor when there is an opportunity for there to be a transaction, a team is being sold. That's one of the first questions our clients are asking as investors is about the real estate, who owns that, and the revenue sharing because that's such a big driver on the ability for there to be a profit. Let's talk a little bit more just about the cost of that experience. Building a new stadium or arena is a huge investment. Stacey, given your perspective, would really appreciate hearing from you a little bit about this as well. What is the relationship between local governments and teams or team owners today? And importantly, a lot of clients are interested in investing outside of the U.S. where I think the story is quite different in Europe. So I would love your perspective on that as well. Yeah. These buildings are expensive. They're very expensive to build. Some of the large market sports teams can afford to pay for them all entirely themselves, but that's not the case across the board. You do see today a resurgence, once again, of public investment into stadiums that we've seen take place across the country, which I think is important to ensuring that these assets get built and built to meet the demands of not just the team but the community. That is something that the United States, I think, has done really well. When we look at Europe, there is very little to no public money invested in stadiums overall. These have some examples, but they're the exception rather than the rule. So in Europe, where the assets in many cases are truly community-owned assets, where Barcelona and Real Madrid are owned by socios, literally owned by their fans, and the fans vote on who will run the clubs and how decisions will be made and what the budget will be, you have such a different dynamic in that regard, and the buildings are just as expensive to build and hard to afford. So something we talk about in Europe with clubs is, is there a way to introduce the concept of public support to these buildings? Is there another way to get municipal involvement? Very limited success there yet, but it is a conversation that's happening in Europe. Take a step back. Every one of these transactions is a public-private partnership. You need to have the environmental process. You need to have the road study. You need the government approval to get your building permits, and some places it works very, very well. Some places it doesn't. For example, in Italy, we've been trying to do new stadiums for 10 years. It's very, very difficult, very historic buildings, the process you have to go through, even when they're not putting money in. So these are very challenging, and it's why Stacey and I have a job, because we've been through this. Every deal is different, but you learn through the process. So let us talk a little bit more about how you finance some of these projects to get to how they're envisioned for the future. Greg, Stacey referenced the project finance model that you designed many years ago. How has that evolved as the projects have evolved? Can you walk us through the mechanics? You know, we have a thing called a mortgage or a leasehold mortgage on most of our transactions where you have a perfected security interest in those revenue streams. The problem is you also have a team. That team values have already doubled. That team has to play there. In the United States, most of the leagues have a thing called a consent letter. So if the team is short on the revenues they're generating, the league says, all right, team owner, you really have to step in, because if you don't pay your sports-related indebtedness, we'll step in, fix the issue, and if you don't come up with the money, we'll sell the team, and then you'll get everything that's left. It works very, very well. And so the United States, the cost of funding from a spread basis in almost all the leagues has come down tremendously because people feel very, very comfortable with the league oversight. In Europe, it's a brave new world. The league oversight is less. The tools that the leagues have are also limited. They don't have the ability to take away an owner. So it's about how much leverage. But you think about someone like Barcelona. Barcelona has 400 million followers. Their stadium, when we open it next year, it's going to have 105,000 seats. It's incredible. The environment, the change, and it's a renovation. They are following the US model. The league oversight is still less, and the markets are less developed. We can do 30-year debt in the United States pretty easily. The capital market's there. It's a 10- to 15-year market. We're expanding it. But a lot of this is the US investors because they understand the risk profile. So that creativity that you initiated 25 years ago continues. I'd love to hear from both of you as you think about ways that you can structure these deals in terms of what you're able to share publicly. Are there some examples that you can speak to in terms of how you're looking to create creative solutions for clients in this space? Well, I think the securitization structure that we've used in Europe, really our borrower is purchasing certain revenue streams from the team that will be generated in the building. But we aren't dealing with having to operate the building. And it's a completely different spin on how to raise money. And in Europe, that's really important because there isn't public money and the ability to have other sources in the same way. And so it allows you to potentially be able to access a little bit more debt capital instead of having to use as much equity or finding other sources of capital. Other ways that we have been looking at that are harder to do, but things that we think about is if a team enters into a really great naming rights agreement with a really strong counterparty and enters into that contract early enough, there's an ability to just securitize that single contract and bring decades worth of payments up front. And so that's another creative method we've looked at. So how has that change that you just described impacted the investors in this space? These sports teams in Europe in particular, but it's true in the US too, but in Europe, if you want to play in UEFA for the football teams, you have to meet financial fair play rules. And financial fair play, the long and short of it is you can't spend more on expenses, which is basically players, but stadium expenses and so on. Your expenses can't exceed your revenues except by a small amount, but effectively you can spend what you earn. So if you think about sports teams, they earn media revenues, they earn sponsorship revenues, they call it commercial, but sponsorship revenues. And then whatever revenues you make on match day or game day in the United States. And so media rights have gotten pretty high. So the commercial, the sponsorship similarly has been grown a lot, but the revenue that has not yet been maximized, especially in Europe, is that match day revenue. And it's so important that you're able to finance these new buildings to increase that match day revenue. So you can increase your overall revenues as a club in order to be able to afford a greater payroll. And if you have a higher payroll, you're more likely to win more games. And if you win more games, you'll win more championships. That virtuous circle of the strategy everybody puts in their deck that they showed us for their club strategy of how they're going to move forward. But the reason why everyone has it in their decks is because it's the right way to think about things. And so what's critical with our financing structures and what we really focus on is we want that debt to be as low cost as possible. So we want to create as high a rated investment grade credit as possible in order to have the lowest cost debt so that you don't want your debt service to exceed the cost of the new revenues being generated. So there's this balancing act of having that debt be affordable. The old rule of thumb used to be that 80% of a building is paid for by 20% of the seats. It's kind of still the same. It hasn't changed in 25 years. You have naming rights and sponsorship. But that premium, that exclusivity that is offered is very, very important. I was just at the opening of the Intuit Dome, which is the most expensive arena. The Intuit Dome is just the arena on steroids. Phenomenal, phenomenal facility. And it's just this next mark. But that entertainment experience that people will have, it's very, very important. People want to feel they're going to a safe, wonderful, and they walk out with a big smile on their face no matter what happens on the court or the pitch or the field. Does that mean that there's no max in terms of what the fan is willing to pay for that experience? You know, there's always that fine line. And you take a look at SoFi that's next door, that is the most expensive stadium. There is a fine line, and it's market to market to market. And in New York and in LA and in London, you really can push things. There's only so much money they can generate in that middle market. If you take a look at the Minnesota Twins versus the New York Yankees, the legends' seats, you're talking about five times the amount of money New York can get for those seats than the Minnesota Twins. But I think what, you know, when we talk with sports teams and we hear what they're thinking, they're thinking about their fans. They're thinking about all their fans. They're thinking about the fans who are going to demand the wine paired dinners by a Michelin chef. They're thinking about the fans, though, who, year in, year out, they're supporting their club. They've joined a supporters club. They're following every trade. But their price points can be at a different price point. And all of the teams we work with are thinking about making sure that their experience is true to what they want in their building. And so you think about that supporters section at LAFC Stadium, which is just incredible. They throw a lot of beer at one another, but it's just an incredible experience. Small price to pay. Well, they do it to celebrate, because when you throw it in the air, it's gold, like their colors. And then you see this gold in the air. It's a great view. But when you think about Spotify Camp, no, there's going to be all these new amenities for fans, some as simple as an escalator, but also amazing concessions, plenty of bathrooms, all these new amenities for fans. But really, the socios, it's all designed to make sure that they're still able to come in at a price point that is in line with what their history has been. And so that's been super important. Thank you both for a really exciting discussion. Any final comments, things that you'd like to cover that we haven't before we go? The evolution of the sports ecosystem continues to expand. Whatever it was five years ago, what it's going to be in five years, put your seatbelt on and get on for the ride. Well said. Thank you, Stacey. Thank you, Greg. Thanks for having us. Great to talk with you. Coming up on our final episode, I'm kind of chuckling right now, because from serious to purchase was like a blink of an eye. We were such fans and friends of the team and kind of understood them and understood this moment. Much of the decision was based on instinct.

So is that a problem for investors? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month, I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top-of-mind report from Goldman Sachs Research. This month, I spoke to two prominent market watchers who are on opposite sides of this very relevant debate. David Koston, our chief U.S. equities strategist in Goldman Sachs Research, believes that investors should be concerned about the high level of U.S. equity market concentration today. That's because he finds that high concentration is associated with lower returns over the longer run. But Owen Lamont, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Akkadian Asset Management, disagrees. He says that current concerns about high U.S. market concentration are overblown. I started off by asking my colleague David Koston just how unusual the level of market concentration is today. He discussed two measures he uses to determine this, the share of total S&P 500 market cap accounted for by the top 10 stocks and the market cap of the largest stock relative to the 75th percentile stock. One measure that's easy for people to comprehend, understand, track, follow, what have you, is the weight of the S&P 500 market cap that is contributed by the top 10 stocks. We have data going back 45 years, and we have data on a daily basis. You can actually look at it very specifically. And the specific number is those top 10 companies today comprise around 36 percent of the market cap. And if you go back over time, it's around 20 percent. At the peak of the dot-com boom in 2000, it was about 25 percent. And then we use another approach or time series that brought the data back a hundred years. Today, 36 percent of the market cap is the top 10 stocks. Using the other metric, we are at a level that we've never seen before since 1932. So how concerned should investors be about this high level of concentration today? So a critical observation is that a high-concentration market has information about long-term fold returns, not necessarily near-term returns. So the way you posited the question was, how concerned should they be about it today? They should be concerned about it from a long-term investment perspective. We'll take 10 years as a long-term measure. So it doesn't tell you what's the risk of the market in the next week or month or six months, year. It is informative about the long-term return prospects. And one of the reasons is that valuation and concentration are two distinct variables. They're not the same. They can be correlated at some points, but they are oftentimes not correlated. Over time, they're not correlated. By using concentration as an additional input and thinking about long-term returns, it's an important variable. So your question, how concerned should they be, they should be concerned because it has impact on longer-term returns and the high level of concentration today, which suggests that the returns going forward are likely to be lower than they might have otherwise been if you had a low-concentration market. Obviously, it's not counterfactual, but looking backwards, that's the experience a high-concentration market is typically associated with a lower return going forward. So in your analysis, market concentration is a consistently reliable indicator of future returns? In our model, it's statistically significant in terms of incremental adding value in explaining forward returns. What I mean by that is if you think about how to forecast longer-term returns, the model looks at a variety of inputs, valuation being the most important informative variable about what the returns are likely to be going forward. The profitability of companies is another variable. This rate environment today would be important information content about forward returns and concentration similarly adds to the accuracy of our forecast. So we can both model including concentration as a variable, or we can remove that. And I think that's an important point to understand, that typical annualized 10-year return over any moving window over the last 100 years is about 11%. So if you didn't know anything else, historical experience is you get 11% annualized total return in the stock market. The last 10 years has been around 13.5%. So for the next 10 years, what should we expect? Our conclusion is even if we don't include concentration, we just use some of the other variables I mentioned, valuation, interest rates, profitability, some economic growth assumptions, that would suggest your return profile in the next 10 years is likely to be below average. It's like 3 to 11% in that range, midpoint around 7%. However, when we incorporate concentrations of variable, that shifts it lower because it does have statistical significance in making our model more accurate by including it. So that leads us to a conclusion of somewhere between minus 1%, extraordinarily low, to 7%, midpoint is around 3. So it shifts the goalpost by around 400 basis points. So from 7 to 3%. If you think about what's driving that unique market concentration factor that's weighing on that 10-year average, what's the intuition behind why that drags on returns? The intuition is with high concentration, the forward realized volatility is likely to be greater because it's a narrow group of companies driving the index. Any portfolio, if you have a relatively few number of constituents, the return is going to be more volatile than in a broadly diversified portfolio and investors are not being compensated because the valuation is not attractively valued for this expected higher realized volatility. And the reason that we make that statement is the following. If you look at these leading stocks, they trade today with a negative risk premium. We have not seen that at all for 20 years at 31 times earnings for these companies. The inverse of 31 times is about 3.2%. That's an earnings yield. Look at 10-year US treasury yields today, it's like 4.2%. That's a negative risk premium. You get a earnings yield that's below the return that you can get on 10-year treasury yields. The rest of the market is trading at a positive risk premium. That's one factor. And then the second is these stocks that are driving that high concentration are trading at very high valuations because the expectation is their growth is going to be really, really elevated for a persistently long period of time going forward. These companies are expected to have 20% growth going forward. But history shows that the number of companies that can actually deliver 20% growth year after year after year after year fades dramatically. And almost no companies can continue to do that over a decade. So how might you be wrong? In other words, if it turns out 10 years from now that this argument was incorrect, that high concentration did not, in fact, drag out S&P 500 returns, where might you have gone wrong? Obviously, there's a lot of places we can be wrong. The first would be the idea of artificial intelligence being a contributor to more sustainable sales growth for these companies, and they can continue to maintain high valuations. That's number one risk. And the second risk is when you forecast something out 10 years, the constituents of the market, it's an important observation, but about 3.5% of the constituents of the index turn over every year. So you run that out over a decade, and roughly a third of the companies are going to be new in the 10 years. And so we're forecasting something that is yet to be determined at the present time. So that's another source of potential risk. And the third would be the extent that you have incremental household allocation to equities. That would be another potential source of demand. We think that's less likely because the allocation of household portfolios to equities is about 50% based on the Federal Reserve data. Going back to 1952, 70 years, we are at the highest level that we've been. You could say we have a more equity-oriented investment culture for households. So you could make a case, maybe it's going to go to 60%, certainly a possibility. So I'd say those are three risks that could create a scenario where returns will be greater than we're assuming. So what should investors do then? We're not saying equities will generally do badly. We have a lower-than-average return for a capitalization-weighted index, but the typical stock is likely to give you an 8% return, which has been an attractive return over history. And so our argument is, look, if you're going to be in the public equity market at this juncture with the high concentration that we're at right now, we would recommend non-taxable investors ought to be owning an equal-weighted benchmark as opposed to a cap-weighted benchmark. Now, we're forecasting on a 10-year horizon. The data in our model would suggest that that is a better way to invest. 80% of the time over a 10-year horizon, an equal-weighted index does better than a cap-weighted index, 80% of the time. Next I spoke to portfolio manager Owen Lamont, who sees all of this differently. I took the same approach as I did with Koston and first asked him how concentrated the U.S. equity market is today. There are different ways to measure market concentration, but a simple way is just, what is the weight of the top 10 largest firms in the total market cap? So if you look at it that way, as of today in the U.S. stock market, we're in the neighborhood of 30%, higher than it was in 1999, but not as high as it was in the 1950s and 60s or the 1930s. So I would say it's within historical norms for the United States. So that's the United States. If you compare it to other countries, the U.S. is currently, and has always been, way more diversified and less concentrated than other countries. So as of today, most countries in Europe are more concentrated than us by that metric. And in other countries around the world, like in Taiwan or in South Korea, there's just one company that's 20% of the market. So compared to them, we're way less concentrated, way more diversified. And historically, like at one point, there was one company that was 70% of the Finnish stock market. So compared to either historically or internationally, we're pretty well diversified. We're not alarmingly concentrated today. There's obviously so much investor concern today about this so-called very high market concentration. So do you think that that concern then is just overblown? I do think that concern is overblown. It's a fact that concentration has gone up in recent years, but it's not an alarming fact. I think the driving reality is that the concentration of profits has gone up in the U.S. in the past 10 years. So the reason the U.S. stock market has gotten more concentrated is just because profits have gotten more concentrated. It's as simple as that. The reasons to be alarmed would be if prices got out of line with fundamentals. And that may be a small part of the story here, but the main part of the story is just that the fundamentals got more concentrated. The percent of profits produced by the top 10 firms has gone up. So I would say that today's high stock market concentration is mainly just a mechanical function or a mechanical byproduct of the fact that mega cap growth firms have had incredibly high profit growth in the past 10 years. And that is the main story. The second story is that growth firms, mega cap tech firms, are somewhat more richly valued than they were 10 years ago. Put those two facts together and you've got a more concentrated market. So if you want to worry about something, worry about those things, don't worry about concentration. But I think a lot of people perceive that that concentration in markets increases the riskiness of markets. Is that true? I'd love to talk about that. Okay. So I think that's confusing. Two concepts. One is when I choose what stocks to own, do I construct a concentrated portfolio? And there, it's definitely true that smaller number of names or a bigger weight into one name in your portfolio generally increases risk. But when the market chooses portfolio weights that are more concentrated, I don't think that increases risk. I don't think it's true, for example, that in the 1950s, the stock market was way riskier because it was more concentrated. That stock market was probably safer in the 1950s, less volatile, less risky. Here's the two places where risk come from. They either come from fundamental risk, economic risk, or they come from prices that move away from fundamentals. And I don't think either of those are somehow necessarily increased because the stock market concentration goes up. And let me give you an example. In 1984, the Justice Department caused AT&T, the big monopolistic phone company, to split up into seven stocks, seven baby bells instead of one big mob bell. I don't think that increased or decreased the risk of the stock market. It changed measured concentration, but I don't think it necessarily made the market safer just because there were seven stocks before there were one. Also, many of the stocks, let's just take the stocks in The Magnificent Seven, many of those stocks are already super well diversified. They're doing different things. They're doing streaming movies. They're doing e-commerce. They're doing cloud storage. They're already pretty diversified. And if I take a bunch of very successful, profitable, pretty uncorrelated businesses and put them in one big stock, and that stock has a lot of weight, that's no big deal. Is there any relationship between market concentration and returns? I don't see a strong relationship historically between concentrated markets and subsequent performance. And let's just take 1999 as an example. There was a big tech stock bubble in 1999, peaking at 2000. And it's also true that that happened to be higher market concentration then. But the higher market concentration was not the causal effect. The causal mechanism was the market was expensive, and there were a bunch of growth stocks that were super expensive. And it doesn't really matter if there was 10 growth stocks that were super expensive or 1,000 growth stocks that were super expensive. The main thing to look at is valuation. I think there's lots of reasons to think the US stock market is overvalued today, like the value spread, which measures growth stocks being expensive relative to value stocks. And that's more of a measure of whether growth stocks are overpriced. Not the whole market, but maybe it's a symptom of the market going crazy or getting too excited. But there's lots of concerning measures that say the market is overvalued, but I don't think concentration is one of those measures. I think people who are focused on this idea that concentration and returns are correlated are looking at research that has shown that it's very difficult for firms to maintain the outperformance and the profitability for sustained periods. So over time, that performance will deteriorate and returns will be lower in the future. Is it true that when you have one or two big firms dominating the stock market, those one or two big firms subsequently do poorly? Yes, that is true. It's not because they're big relative to the rest of the stock market. It's because they're expensive. So it's true that expensive stocks, whether they dominate the stock market or don't, expensive stocks do poorly, both because their fundamentals subsequently disappoint and because they're just expensive and that price needs to go down relative to fundamentals. So for those two reasons, we generally would call that the growth effect or the value effect is that value stocks do well, growth stocks do poorly. So just due to the fact that they're expensive, I would expect the largest stocks in the U.S. stock market to disappoint over time. Okay, so that's like a constant through history. And maybe I shouldn't say it's a constant through history because one of the things that happened in the past 10 years is the big growth stocks 10 years ago did well. They didn't mean revert like they usually do. So that's one reason concentration has gone up is because for reasons that are historically unusual, big growth stocks got even bigger. But the stocks that were important to the U.S. economy 30 years ago are not the stocks that are important today. So I think 30 years from now, we will have all kinds of firms you've never heard of that are important, that are generating jobs and generating profits and generating value for shareholders. And so it is an inevitable part of the American experience that we have creative destruction. We have old firms get smaller and new firms get born and they get bigger. So I think that's likely to happen. It would be very surprising to me if the magnificent seven of today are dominating the economy 20 years from now. So I am not concerned about individual firms doing poorly. That's part of how our system works. Interesting. So do you have a forecast about what equity returns could be in the next decade? Sure. I think that there's one bedrock math fact. And that is things that are expensive generally have low subsequent returns. So I would say based on the fact the U.S. stock market is expensive today, that it's going to have lower returns in the next 10 years compared to the previous 10 years. So what else should investors be concerned about? Okay. So first of all, there are the obvious geopolitical concerns that everyone talks about. And those are big concerns. The second thing is AI. AI is this very important innovation. And it's at least as important as the Internet was. And it's probably more important. So if we think about the Internet that was introduced in the 1990s, that had all kinds of implications. It killed some firms like Blockbuster. It created some other firms like some of the biggest firms today could not exist without the Internet. And it created this huge bubble in 1999. And looking forward, I see all kinds of upside and downside risk in AI. So I could imagine that one scenario is we relive the experience of 1999. We have this huge AI boom or maybe an AI bubble. And maybe that's already started. I don't know. So that's one scenario. You could also imagine a scenario in which AI is so transformative that it destroys the value of many existing firms, just like what happened to Blockbuster, but on a bigger scale. And the whole stock market goes down. So to me, in the next five or 10 years, when I look at the U.S. stock market, I see tremendous upside risk and tremendous downside risk. You know, it's really interesting because even though David and Owen have opposite views on whether investors should worry about market concentration, they do agree that U.S. equities will likely deliver lower returns over the next decade than in the previous one.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-11-26 21:33:41+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How AI could impact geopolitics\n**Episode ID:** 4526\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nThe rise of AI isn't just a tech story. It could have profound implications for energy markets, for geopolitics, and to better understand all this, I'm sitting down today with Jared Cohen, who is our President of Global Affairs and co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. Jared, welcome back to the program. Always a pleasure to have you. So, Jared, we have had a lot of discussions on this program about the many ways that AI is shaping markets, the many ways that it could shape industries and economies, but you're focused on what it could shape even beyond that. Why is this an issue for the U.S.? So, look, when it comes to AI, there's a lot of known unknowns, right? Will it be open-weighted models over closed models that win out? Will the use cases ever justify the enormous spend? Who will be the winners and losers? These are all very interesting questions. None of them are urgent. There's a very urgent question right now, which is the one that I'm focused on, which is if AI software has to run on AI hardware somewhere, can the U.S. maintain a leadership position when it comes to generative AI? And the answer comes down to a larger question about whether or not the infrastructure can be built to keep a pace with the demand. And the punchline is the U.S. can maintain that leadership position. The infrastructure can keep up with demand, but not exclusively in the U.S. To me, this is the most urgent known unknown, because if the U.S. wants to continue to dominate in this AI journey and AI revolution, it's going to need options outside of the U.S. to augment and supplement that. Why can't the U.S. do this? What is the constraint there? Is it just a funding issue, or is it actual physical limitations? So, there's no shortage of funding in this space. The hyperscalers are set to spend roughly $1.1 trillion on the higher end in capex associated with meeting AI demand. The issue is, if you look at the 8,000 data centers worldwide, there's roughly 3,000 in the United States. Those data centers have very low vacancy. So, you have less than 3% vacancy rates. So, that's one problem, is we don't have enough space in existing data centers. Second problem, if you look at our existing data centers, a lot of them support cloud workloads. AI workloads are ultra-high density, requiring a concentrated source of power. So, it's a very different kind of engineering problem. So, the question becomes, can you retrofit existing data centers to accommodate AI workloads? It's either prohibitively expensive, not practical, or just not feasible. So, we have a need for differentiated data centers as a second problem. So, we have vacancy problem. We have a need for differentiated data centers. But let's say we figure all of that out. AI workloads, because they require a concentrated source of power, that power also has to be largely baseload. So, intermittent power like solar and wind don't work. So, the U.S. has plenty of baseload power. If you think about natural gas, which should not be a short-term solution, nuclear, which is a better long-term solution, in theory, the U.S. has that baseload power. But where that baseload power exists, transporting it to new data centers to run these AI workloads becomes a political problem. So, think not in my backyard. So, the U.S. is going to need to bring another roughly 35-plus gigawatts online to meet this AI demand. We don't have enough differentiated data centers, and we don't have enough powered land to do it. And so, the U.S. is going to need some kind of an overflow option to deal with this hockey stick growth in power demand. And the issue is, for decades, we got used to power demand that was either flat or, frankly, declining. And our energy grid is under an enormous amount of pressure right now. Extreme weather conditions, you know, delayed maintenance, lag time associated with getting the permitting and necessary requirements for upgrades to that electric grid. And so, this isn't a, we need to figure this out by the end of the decade. Over the next 12 to 18 months, the U.S. is going to have to make a very important decision about where all of this AI infrastructure is going to get built. And it's not about nature. It's about geopolitics. It's nations that are going to be the ones who decide where these data centers are built. And so, here's where the geopolitics has a tremendous and important nexus with what's happening technologically. And so, what will that look like and what will be the implications for the U.S.? So, I think the U.S. has three options for an overflow for building out AI infrastructure. And none of them are really great options. So, one option is you kind of keep it in, let's call it the Jeffersonian-ish democratic world. So, think Canada, the Nordic countries, Australia, great options, France. The problem is they're going to have a lot of the same political issues that we have here in the U.S. And there's a risk in going all in on that. So, geopolitically, you don't worry about those countries staying on sides, but you worry that they have a lot of the same kind of complicated domestic political issues associated with baseload power. Also, democratic countries don't have a track record of being able to do massive infrastructure at scale efficiently and quickly enough to meet this. So, we should try, and that should certainly be some of the play for AI infrastructure. But there's a risk that if you go all in on that type of country, none of it ends up manifesting. Second option is you allow it to persist in the global south and you just kind of optimize for where there's cheap baseload power. That takes you to places like Indonesia and Malaysia. The problem there is if you think about the whole geopolitical thesis around this, the U.S. wants to prevent China from getting AI capacity around these large language models. Indonesia and Malaysia, it's very unlikely that if they are able to become hubs for all this demand, that capacity won't be allocated directly to China. So, that's not a great option. The third option, the Middle East. And the Middle East, probably more than any other countries, has probably the best attributes to accommodate all this. They have the cheap access to energy. They have an abundant amount of land. We all know they can build massive infrastructure at scale very quickly. They can build all this near the coastline, which is very useful for technology around liquid cooling of the chip so they don't get overheated. They have the sovereign ambition. They have an enormous amount of capital that they can deploy flexibly and as they see fit. And so, in the short term, the Middle East makes a lot of sense. By the way, a lot of the Middle Eastern countries have also proven a willingness under some pressure from the U.S. to rip out a lot of the Chinese-made hardware to accommodate U.S. interests and get those necessary chip allocations to be able to do this. The problem in the Middle East is, fast forward, let's call it 10 years from now, all of this AI capacity persists in the Middle East. And how do you know that they stay on sites? So there's a longer-term geopolitical question of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE. These are all geopolitical swing states. They have enough economic wherewithal that on many issues, they've been willing to kind of swing on an issue-by-issue basis. Their economic interests drive a lot of their geopolitical thinking. And so, if you think about the future, that AI capacity is very valuable. China is still their number one trading partner. So how do you ensure that the geopolitics net out in the way that you want them to if you're the U.S. government a decade from now? So none of these options are kind of a panacea to this geopolitical set of issues and the question of where the AI infrastructure is gonna be built. If I had to guess, it's gonna be some combination of the first option, which is keep it in the democratic world and bias towards the Middle East. And I think, by the way, under the new administration, I would suspect that there's gonna be a larger gravitational pull towards the Middle East. And watch very carefully, depending on how things play out with the war in the Middle East and a re-architecture of the Middle East. If you end up with a scenario where there's a number of things that Saudi Arabia wants, there's another number of things the U.S. administration is willing to give in exchange for normalization of relations with Israel and a re-architecture of the Middle East, I would be very surprised if an allocation of chips necessary to build out AI infrastructure wasn't part of the equation. Right. I guess my question to you is, are these companies, these U.S. companies leading this, are they on board? So I think we're sort of early days on this. These countries in the Middle East have a lot of leverage to be able to get countries to set up shop on the ground. I think the inflection point is a shift from doing so in a performative way or in a reactionary way. I think what these countries would actually like is for the U.S. companies to see the value of setting up shop there independent of the things that they want from these countries. And I think we're not at the beginning of this, but that hasn't really reached its full maturity yet. But it's trending in that direction. But I think it's going to be a long process. Understood. But look, we've already seen, I think, in some other industries, that process moving forward. But these things take time, right? If you think about the big push towards India, as an example, to diversify supply chains away from China, move it to India, even in the world's largest democracy with a rich history of business that's been integrated with the U.S. in a lot of ways for many, many decades, it's a long process there. And it doesn't happen overnight. What I would say is there is right now a very pronounced we have, we need dynamic between companies in the U.S. and the three Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE. And it's not just about capital. It's about capital. It's about energy. It's about a regulatory ecosystem that these leaders control. It's about the ability to do massive infrastructure quickly and at scale. It's about abundance of land. But it's also about an evolution in both the human capital and the mindset of these countries that all of a sudden changed the thesis. And so how does China fit into all of this? How is it positioning itself in this, you know, global AI infrastructure race, which it does not want to lose out on for sure? So, for starters, if I had to describe the U.S.-China tech competition before generative AI, I would have said the U.S. had a three-decade first-mover advantage, and it kind of ended in a tie. Because it was an asymmetric competition between the U.S. and China. Most of those asymmetries disproportionately benefited China. And the view was that those asymmetries are America's problem, not ours. Then generative AI gave the U.S. a lifeline in the sense that China had an uphill battle when it came to large language models, because they didn't have the compute power with GPUs because of export controls. They didn't want to train models at internet scale because of the Chinese firewall. And the way they govern their models was incredibly restrictive. And you weren't exactly seeing large flocks of entrepreneurs moving to Beijing to set up the next large mega cap company for all the things that we've seen happen domestically to companies that have experienced that journey. That being said, necessity drives innovation. And right now, one of the things we're seeing China do is they're trying to push themselves to have an efficiency renaissance where they're trying to capture efficiencies both from an energy perspective and a performance perspective within the models. Right now, it's an impressive R&D story. We'll see how it materializes. They're still behind. There's a lot of debate about how close they are to catching up. I think we don't really know yet, but they certainly have the human capital and they have the resources to throw at it. The second thing you're seeing them do is lean into some of this sort of race around data centers around the world. So China has an initiative that they call Eastern Data, Western Computing. And by the way, they account for about a third of the clean energy investments around the world, but they're investing $6.1 billion in creating these different data center hubs around the world, leaning into the fact that they're the number one trading partner still with a lot of countries. They have massive investments in nuclear power, which is something they're uniquely able to do. And so it's this interesting story of contradictions. I think last year, they produced a record amount of coal while at the same time producing a record amount of clean energy investments around the world. So they have the ability to kind of wear different hats in this journey, and they certainly have plenty of resources. But this is existential for them. They can't afford to fall behind in this. They've been in a situation where they've had to catch up before, and they've successfully caught up before in a lot of different technologies. But there's never been a technology more important than this. Why wouldn't they look to the Middle East to partner with the Middle East? And why wouldn't the Middle East find them a compelling partner? So that's a very good question. So I mentioned before that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE are each what I would describe as geopolitical swing states, meaning they have things about their economies that differentiate them, that in a competition between the US and China, put them in this unique position where both countries need them to get ahead. And that gives them an enormous amount of leverage to kind of play both sides and act more geopolitically independent or quasi-independent. It turns out that when it comes to AI infrastructure, because the US has so much unilateral power, because of the allocation of GPUs, that that might be the limits of how much they can lean into that economic advantage to embrace this geopolitical swing state status because they can't build out the AI infrastructure for this new chapter of artificial intelligence without getting that allocation from the US, which requires approval from the US government, right? So in the short and medium term, it's a binary choice. They can either lean into China on AI, or they can lean into the US on AI. Again, I'm talking about, you know, for generative AI, AI is a very broad category, right? But I'm talking about the AI that requires the most advanced chips, it's a binary choice. And right now, you're seeing each of these countries lean into the US. And how much does the fact that Donald Trump is going to be our president again shortly, weigh into that binary choice? Does that matter a lot in terms of thinking about some of the policy shifts he seems to want to pursue? So when it comes to US and China, my view is this is the issue that has the most bipartisan consensus. It's the most important geopolitical issue. It's the foundational geopolitical theater that is why I believe the geopolitics are more uncertain than they have been in at least three decades. When Donald Trump was president the first time, he was the first one to change the policy, the policy for multiple administrations, Democrat and Republican had been bring China into the liberal international order, and they'll conform and everything will work out. Trump got the US off of that policy and pivoted towards a tough protectionist posture on China. I think that America's allies and partners were surprised when Joe Biden came in and didn't just continue Trump's policies, but was actually even more protectionist than his predecessor. And I think whether you got Harris or were getting Trump, it's going to be the case that each administration is gonna be tougher than the previous administration. I think that will continue apace. I think the character of that protectionism doesn't particularly change from one administration to the other. I think it just gets more intensified, right? So the caricature used to be that the Republicans like tariffs, Democrats like export controls. I think where it's netted out is they both like both. And, you know, we pay more attention to tariffs because Trump is very vocal about them. But a lot of people have a lot of opinions about what's gonna happen when the 47th president takes office. I think that it's hard to imagine that you're not gonna have an expansion of tariffs that touch this particular issue. I think the thing that I would watch for is, are there additional tariffs that we see that inadvertently impact the AI supply chain in ways that were not obvious, right? Here, you're talking about, you know, the refining and processing of certain critical minerals that go into the wafers. And, you know, these things, when an administration comes in, they do a lot very quickly. The transition team isn't the same thing as a fully staffed administration. They announce things on day one, and then the second and third order effects reveal themselves. But until we see what that first batch of executive orders are, it's impossible to know.

Sports is the best thing in the world in terms of content. The price tag on the latest NBA deal underscores that point. $76 billion for the league over an 11-year period. Who's in, who's out, is notable as well. A tech platform is in, while a legacy broadcaster is out. So you have more groups that think they have more distribution capabilities, and they all feel they have the ability to make money on it. The sports media landscape is in the midst of a significant disruption. Even as many people traded in their cable boxes for streaming subscriptions, the demand for live sports content remains high. It's a coveted viewership that players across the sports ecosystem are eager to reach. Brands, advertisers are desperate to find these aggregated audiences, and they're increasingly paying top dollar to do that. This is Investing in Sports, a four-part series from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast on the changing dynamics at the intersection of sports and finance. I'm Nicole Pullen-Ross, I lead the private wealth management business for the New York region at Goldman Sachs. And I also head our sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs private wealth management. In this episode, I'm speaking again with Dave Dassey, the global co-head of sports investment banking at Goldman Sachs. We're also joined by Gene Sykes. Gene is our co-chair of mergers and acquisitions, as well as the co-chair of global technology, media, and telecom, also referred to as TMT. I think of Gene as a senior American diplomat of sports. He has led the bid and organizing committee for the 2028 Olympic Games in LA. He serves as president and chair of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, and recently became a member of the International Olympic Committee, which is the governing body of the games. In my conversation with Dave and Gene, we'll discuss what makes sports content so valuable. The competition between the legacy broadcasters and the tech platforms, new direct to consumer models, and how all of this disruption could influence the game itself. I think you're going to find shorter games, more action, potentially higher scores, and an opportunity for the most extravagant, most magnificent athletic performances to be more evident on a more frequent basis in these games. Gene and Dave, so excited for today's conversation. Thank you for joining me. Excited to be here. Thank you. Gene, you have a really interesting vantage point, having worked with media clients on some of the biggest deals in the industry. When did it become clear that media rights would be such a key component of a sports team's valuation? Well, teams have been selling for a long time, often to very wealthy people. And you'd say, well, those very wealthy people, they'd pay almost inconceivable amounts for the teams. But at some level, people had to base their valuations on something, on cash flow, or the opportunity for values to increase. And the transaction I remember the most was the sale of the Dodgers to Guggenheim Baseball Partners. That took place in 2012. The Dodgers had been owned at that point by a husband and wife, the McCourt family. And they had a lot of money. And they had a very nasty, very public divorce, which sort of forced the sale of the team. McCourt had bought the team from News Corporation family, the Murdoch family. Here, a media company owned the business. And they thought, well, we don't really need to own the business. All we need to own is the media rights to the business. That was their theory, at least. And by 2012, these media rights had, in effect, been embodied through regional sports networks, which were partnerships between some media company, some kind of a distributor, a programmer or distributor, and the teams. And in Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable at the time was the biggest single provider of distributed cable services in this market. And they decided they wanted to launch a very, very big RSN. And they went after both the Lakers and the Dodgers. And the value of those two contracts was extraordinarily high over a very, very long term. But the sale of the Dodgers coincided with the negotiation of these media contracts. And the buyers, the Guggenheim sports partners, they are rich guys now. They were rich then, but not as rich as they are today, for sure. And they weren't in a position to simply pay silly money for the Dodgers, but they bid what seemed to be a silly price, $2 billion for a baseball team, which was probably twice as much as any baseball team had ever sold for before. So there just wasn't a robust market for this until it became evident that you could capitalize the long-term contractual value of the contract with the media players. And that's what capitalized a $2 billion transaction by a buyer who was essentially a financial buyer. Wow, it's incredible. It really is a hallmark. And so much has changed since then. You mentioned the regional sports networks or the RSNs, and we'll get back to those in a moment. But staying on this point about the value of these media rights deals, certainly it varies from league by league. But generally speaking, we've seen a huge surge in these deals. I mean, the recent NBA agreement is a great example of that. Dave, what does the composition of these deals signify about the changing sports media landscape, in your opinion? Well, I think similar to other areas of the economy, the technology innovation and disruption which is taking place is having a huge, huge impact. It wasn't so long ago that the ability to multicast a live sports stream from a technology perspective was an incredibly, incredibly complicated thing to do. Interestingly, Major League Baseball Advanced Media were the ones who developed that first. And we actually worked for Major League Baseball when they sold that to Disney, which became part of the backbone of the Disney Plus platform and the ESPN Plus platform. And so the ability to solve that from a technology perspective until very recently was difficult. That's one element. That combined with the evolution of Netflix and all these other content providers where consumers for the very first time felt like they had the opportunity to consume what they wanted, when they wanted to consume it and in a form that they wanted to consume it. Those two combination of things made it possible to have these digital platforms that can now stream out to tens of millions of people on a simultaneous basis. This has put tremendous pressure on the traditional media businesses, the traditional distributors, where it wasn't so long ago, about a decade or so ago, we had a hundred million cable subscribers. But with the advent of different forms of content and the ability to get it in different forms, that number or cord cutting has dropped pretty dramatically and is now somewhere around 60 million US households or so, which has put a lot of economic pressure on the traditional media companies. Again, it's probably oversimplified this traditional broadcast versus digital streaming because you look at a Disney and an ESPN and what they're doing with ESPN Plus, you look at what Peacock NBC is doing with Peacock. They are absolutely coming at streaming. And in my mind, it's all about increasing the addressable market and giving the consumer, the fan, the opportunity to engage in the content, however they would like to. And clearly you're seeing that you reference the NBA and what they're doing. Certainly the NFL has done this as well with several traditional media partners as well as having Amazon, which has the Thursday night package and then YouTube, which now has Sunday ticket. And they just recently announced they're going to now have games on Christmas day where that's going to be broadcast through Netflix. And so you have more groups that think they have more distribution capability set both broadcasting as well as the tech streaming businesses. And they all feel they have the ability to make money on it. Brands, advertisers are desperate to find these aggregated audiences and they're increasingly paying top dollar to do that, which makes the economic system work for the distributors, whether it be traditional or the new streaming platforms. And it certainly makes it for the leagues, the teams and the players. I mean, it strikes me from my side of the table, we work with individuals all throughout the sports ecosystem, whether they're athletes or team owners. And one of the things that we hear pretty consistently from both groups is the value of the local presence, the connectivity to the community and really the local brand that exists for the organization. We talked about the regional sports networks earlier. When you think about the direction of media rights and the examples you've  I'm curious about the implications of this disruption for the regional sports networks. How do you think the local relationship looks when you have fewer cable customers? Consumers, what they want when they want it. And so again, back to the cord cutting, you're now in a position where consumers, if they want sports, they can pay for sports and they can find sports, but the consumers who may not necessarily like sports don't want to be paying for it. And so implicit in the cable bundle was consumers. Many consumers who may not have an interest in sports or other verticals within the cable bundle were in effect paying for that. And so with this advent and the disruption we're seeing, the whole business model has an effect been turned upside down. There's less money coming in. Therefore the RSNs will have less money that they can pay to the teams. So specific to major league baseball, but also to the NBA and the NHL, the majority of RSN contracts when they're expiring are seeing step downs in terms of the amount of money, which is paid to the individual teams. One specific case is diamond sports, which has an aggregate of about 15 major league baseball teams, 12 or so NBA teams and several hockey teams. That company has been in bankruptcy for the last better part of 18 or 24 months. And so what you're seeing is both the NBA, the NHL, as well as major league baseball are talking about a national local package. So they're potentially going to get the majority of those rights back in some form. And they would like to go out package those rights, not on an individual market by market basis, but package them as a totality across the NBA, across the NHL or across major league baseball, and more than likely do a deal with one of the digital or streaming based companies. We're seeing more innovation from that perspective as well. But I think the short order, Nicole to your question is the impact and financial impact is going to be a negative in the short run. I think it is a temporary step down and we'll see earned back, but it's still early from a direct to consumer perspective. Yeah, we don't know where it's going to go, but they would like to have something that looks like Sunday ticket for the other sports so that you can get everything on one channel and see the local games, but you'd not be able to see the games that were on the other carriers. So the streaming platforms were the other broadcasters who'd paid premium values for a specific package of games. I want to talk a bit more about the streaming platforms. There are the streaming services built by the tech platforms. And then there are the streamers that have come out of the legacy broadcasters. What advantages do some of the tech platforms have in this space? Well, the tech platforms have all sorts of advantages in that they have a much larger user base to start with and they interact with their users much more directly. So they know exactly who's watching what, when, and how much interest they have in what they're watching. And I'd say the tech platforms include Netflix, who's built as a tech platform, not really as a media company, even though we think of them as a media company. So Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Apple to the degree Apple is going to move in this direction. And anybody else who moves in this direction, because you could imagine Meta or somebody else, TikTok putting themselves in a position where they're going to use the same set of interactions and relationships they have with users to figure out how to use sports. Now, the other thing they have is the advantage of not having to share information about ratings. Ratings aren't really important to them and they don't subscribe to Nielsen. They're not trying to characterize the success of what they do by a certain ratings performance. They do have to satisfy the content provider, the league, the league wants to have wide distribution. So the tension from the league's perspective is they want whatever somebody is going to pay for the content to be as high as possible, but they also want as many fans as possible to be able to see the content when it's offered. So that's why broadcast has been helpful to them because they know there's a very, very big audience for broadcast. And we're seeing this play out right now because many of the media companies, as Dave mentioned, NBC has Peacock. Peacock's got 35 million subscribers. It might move to 40 million subscribers just this last football season. They experimented with a Peacock only NBC broadcast or review of an NFL game. They actually had, I think it was 23 million subscribers sign in to see the game, which was at the time, the biggest streaming live audience for anything. So I think what we're seeing is if you have broadcast and cable as a programmer, you're going to hold onto it as long as you can. And sports is the best thing in the world in terms of content that reaches people and will be valuable, both as a source of value through subscription or through affiliate fees, as well as advertising. So they'll hold onto it, but they're all migrating toward platforms which have this direct to consumer characterization. So they understand what the consumer wants and they have other ways of achieving value from their relationship. I want to try to expand the conversation a little bit. So much of what we've talked about so far has been focused on US markets. Primarily. I think the story can be different outside of the US. So Dave, how does the media rights picture look in Europe as a point of comparison? And do you think these trends are unique to Europe or are there lessons for the US market? I think it depends on the sport, Nicole. And one view, which I have is the bigger sports, the more unique content are going to continue to get stronger. And some of the more secondary or sports that don't really have that ability to aggregate audience, maybe in a weaker position going forward. I'd also say part of the issue in Europe, you need to think through is governance. And in the US you have very strict governance in terms of at least the top four leagues, the NFL, the NBA, major league baseball, and the NHL and MLS. I'd put MLS into that category in terms of how decisions get made, how national revenue gets split in Europe. It depends a little bit what league you're in in terms of how the national revenue gets split. Do they all go to market? How much leakage is there out to the local market, which allows stronger teams to generate a lot more revenue than some of the weaker teams. You have things certainly as it pertains to the premier league, I think their total rights now are about $5 billion on an annual basis, which is a very significant number. And they've continued to do quite well in terms of those rights and the monetization of those rights. Interestingly, they've done really, really well internationally, particularly in the US in terms of their distribution agreement with Comcast. But no doubt there's been some of the more secondary soccer markets around the globe that may not have done as well as they would have liked to. But I think part of that comes back to a little bit business model, a little bit governance and structure, a little bit the ability to aggregate the audience. And I think we're just on the cutting edge of this direct to consumer discussion and the ability to monetize what that is. And so I think as these business models evolve, the content that's really unique core and differentiated is going to continue to have a lot of weight. Let's talk about a few more recent trends that we've seen specifically related to live sports content, legal sports betting. It's been a mainstay in European sports for quite some time, but it's much more recent in the US. So today 38 states and the district of Columbia allow sports betting. Just last night I was talking to a friend who was describing how he was betting on the Eagles in terms of the number of scores and the yards and people bet on so many aspects of various games. And so I'm curious, Dave, how is online betting adding to the demand for live content? Well, I think you touched on it, the prop bet. So the ability to bet on seemingly and kind of an endless supply of new ways with games. And I think it's also made every game relevant. So if you're watching a football game 2 a.m. in the morning on the East coast, that's still going on on the West coast. There's a reason to engage or an ability to engage if that's what you have a desire to do. And so this endless supplier, increasingly endless supply of ability to bet is drawing more audience, more interest, and it's bringing more people into the ecosystem. I think it's also having impact in terms of it's bifurcating the true fans who love the games and love the teams from a more commercial element of people are just trying to find ways or they're following games where they may not really have any interest in the outcome, but they think there may be an opportunity to make money through betting. And so I think consistent with what we've seen is it's become digital and you have the ability to do it. What we've seen in Europe, it's going to continue to grow and explode. And as the technology gets better and better and the latency in terms of the broadcast gets shorter and shorter, whether you're broadcasting or coming through satellite or a digital delivery system, you're likely to just see more and more. We have the ability to bet play to play or pitch to pitch. You can kind of follow this to a conclusion where you have a lot of opportunities in terms of every single action in every single game becomes some sort of event that potentially you could bet on.  Another trend that we're seeing is around viewership and engagement there. We're seeing changes at the game level specifically. As you all know, the MLB just brought in the pitch clock. The NFL extended the regular season. The NBA created the end season tournament and notably they saw their ratings go up 16% in early 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. So Jean, how do you think the leagues are evolving the actual product or the content that the game is to meet this moment? Well, I think the leagues have been behaving intelligently. They're recognizing they've got to make the product interesting. They have to make it vital to the user, to the viewer. So the more they can put more elements of dynamic surprise or drama in a shorter period, that helps. They also want people to see the kinds of things that get them excited. So if they can possibly figure out how a baseball game can have more home runs, that's something people will come to the ballpark to watch, or they'll watch it on television or on the streaming platform. So everything that helps the game have more interesting moments and be something in which it's part of the conversation, it's got that excitement. That's very much in the interest of all of the leagues, the team owners. And I think there's a very strong trend at this point to move in that direction and it's across all sports. I think you're going to find shorter games, more action, potentially higher scores, the kinds of things that people want to see and they want to see again and again, and an opportunity for the most extravagant, most magnificent athletic performances to be more evident on a more frequent basis in these games. We've talked about what all this disruption and how games are distributed means for media business models, for the game itself, and for the rise of sports betting. I'd like to talk now about the athletes. How do you see athletes capitalizing on this shift to direct to consumer models, particularly as they're engaging more creatively with fans? Dave? Yeah, I think it's interesting, Nicole. We talked a bit about these viral moments and you look at the Olympics and what happened in Paris and the ability for athletes to take out their phone, take viral moments after winning a medal, after losing, those are incredibly, incredibly powerful. We haven't had those in a past Olympiads. And so this concept of individuals as brands is very, very powerful. And going back to where advertisers, consumer brands want to be is they want to be around incredibly successful people, brands, and the ability to on a more micro basis get to specific audiences. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of innovation from that perspective. Certainly as individuals when their brand profile becomes higher, they get more followers on social media, they engage more, they have the ability to cross pollinate, you know, in essence across the music or entertainment industry. We saw this at the US Open, I think this year, just the brands around the US Open, the star power at the US Open, the promoting of that both in stadium on the broadcast, as well as through social media just continues to drive this back to the experiential. People want to be there. They want to engage with it. It's kind of a must thing to do. Now with technology of the ability to engage in that way physically, if you are fortunate enough to be there, but you also have the ability to engage and be part of that community or similar ecosystem digitally. And so again, we're at the early stages of this, but I think it's incredibly, incredibly powerful. Gene, anything you'd like to add? Well, the athletes have become tremendous celebrities and if they can channel that celebrity, that familiarity with the consumer into something in which their influence, their impact on society, the sort of cultural significance becomes part of their brand. Then I think there's a big opportunity. An example is Steph Curry, who's been in the sort of public limelight for a long time in the most positive  He's created a following that respects the role that he plays in his community with his spouse. And it's very interesting to see how many people are looking for Steph to be a spokesperson or be somebody who leads them on certain tracks to be, you know, better and more effective in all the things they do from a social standpoint. I think that the evidence of how well that's worked for some of the principal and most successful athletes and professional sports is something a lot of people have seen and are looking for a way to take advantage of it. Dave raised a great example of this in his reference to the Olympics. And I have to end our conversation today, Gene, and ask you for a little bit of perspective as we're all so excited about the Olympics in LA in 2028. You played an instrumental role in bringing the 2028 Olympics to LA. Paris has set a very high bar. What do you expect to see from LA specifically in the context of the changing sports media landscape? First of all, we're incredibly excited to host the 28 games in Los Angeles and we're very happy that the Paris games were as successful as they were. The Paris games allowed the world to rediscover the love that people have for the experience of the Olympics and Paralympics, the relationship with the athletes, the national identity with people from your own countries, and then the true unifying character of sports. What LA will do on top of that and somewhat differently, LA has the best sports infrastructure in the world, the best stadia, the best arenas. We have been doing professional sports in Los Angeles in a way that nobody else really ever has at this level. And honestly, we have the best weather for sports anywhere in the world, which I think makes it easy to imagine an effect, a rain free 17 days of Olympic experience when we have it. And then LA is Hollywood. It's the place where creativity really starts. And it's the place where people think about how to portray something in a larger than life way. So I think we're looking forward to what the impact in LA is going to be. But in 2028, in the evolution of all these things that we've been talking about, how technology has made the distribution of media images of sports so much broader, so much more impactful to people. The moment in 2028 for LA to capitalize on that is here. I think it would be great for the future of the Olympic and Paralympic movement, and it will be great for the experience of these games. And as a longtime native Angeleno, I'm very excited for our city to play host to the world in this experience that I also expect will be unforgettable. Thank you both. It's an incredibly valuable perspective that you've shared. Thank you. Thanks, Nicole. Thanks, Nicole. The value of live sports content has turned teams and athletes into global media brands. This will be a fascinating dynamic to watch over the next five to 10 years, especially as the broader media industry continues its shift to direct to consumer models of delivering content. Coming up on our next episode. When you think about being in somebody else's building, you're paying rent to them. They're keeping the suite revenue. They have competing sponsors to you. All of those things go away when you have a place that's all your own. What it means to build and finance the fan experience of the future.

So can the solid performance continue amid the policy shifts ahead? And what might be the implications for markets? I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. In this episode, I'm sitting down with Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, and Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in the Global Markets Research Group, to discuss the economic and market outlook for the year ahead. Jan and Dom recently published their 2025 macro outlook entitled Tailwinds Probably Trump Tariffs. Jan and Dom, welcome back to the program. Thank you. Nice to be with you. So first of all, it's hard to believe a full year has gone by since we'd all sat down together to discuss the outlook for 2024, but here we are. Jan, let me start by saying that when we sat down a year ago, you were forecasting resilient growth globally and especially in the U.S., as well as continued disinflation in the major economies that would pave the way for major central banks to start cutting rates. And all of that has generally played out. But meaningful U.S. economic policy shifts are likely ahead with the election of Donald Trump and a Republican sweep. So in your base case, is the trend of solid growth set to continue? Yes, we think so. We expect another year of above trend and above consensus growth and U.S. outperformance relative to other advanced economies. We're looking for 2.5% in 2025, down a little bit from what we now think is 2.8% for 2024. And most of that is driven by strength that was already underway going into the election. So I would highlight the strength in real disposable personal income growth, which is really driven by the fact that price inflation has fallen a lot more quickly than wage inflation. And so real hourly wages are now growing at a good, say, 1.5% pace. Number two, financial conditions have turned from a headwind to growth in 2022, early 23, into at least a moderate tailwind to the tune of maybe half a percentage point or so. So these were the trends that were already pushing the economy forward. And we think that's likely to continue. If I look at the growth impact of the major policy changes that we expect in the Trump administration unified Republican control over the next several months, I think they're two-sided. There are some drags and some boosts. I would say the drags are tariffs and slower immigration. I think on tariffs, our base case is a reasonably benign one where the tariffs are mostly confined to higher tariffs on China and tariffs on auto imports from Mexico and Europe. But we do not build a full across-the-board 10 or 20% tariff into our base case. That's an important assumption, but under that assumption, the tariff drag is probably reasonably limited, a few tenths of a percentage point. Immigration we think is going to continue to come down substantially, and we do expect it to run at a slower pace than the historical average of about 1 million, but we don't have a large decline in the workforce from net negative immigration in our forecast. And there are, of course, some risks around that, but those are the negatives. The positives are, number one, fiscal policy is probably going to be somewhat easier, extension of the 2017 tax cuts, plus some more moderate additional tax cuts, both on the consumer and the business side, and then probably a regulatory loosening that is going to be more industry-specific but probably will contribute to stronger business confidence and probably some boost to capital spending. So when I take it all together, I'm still broadly comfortable with what was a pretty optimistic view going into the election. And if you use those assumptions and apply it to your inflation outlook, because it seems like there seems to be a lot of concern about inflation, given prospective policy. How do you factor that in, and do you think this inflation will continue? So the underlying trend, again, going into the election, I think is that we were on a good path with inflation gradually coming down, and we're now at 2.7 percent. If you take the core PCE index, you're actually just over 2 percent. If you take the headline PCE index and the drivers of lower inflation, in particular, the rebalancing in the labor market and the slowdown in wage growth, I think are underway. There are also some lagging components of the inflation indices, for example, in rent and owners' equivalent rent, so the housing components, that should continue to help. So X any tariff effects, I would be pretty comfortable with the idea still that we should get to 2 percent or thereabouts for core inflation by the end of next year. However, tariffs will mechanically add to inflation under our baseline of China plus auto tariffs. That's worth about four-tenths of a percentage point, so we've revised up our forecast for where core PCE is going to be at the end of next year to 2.4 percent. And if we were to see an across-the-board tariff, that would not only hit growth harder, but it would also raise inflation probably to somewhere around 3 percent by the end of next year, if not a little bit higher. I want to talk a little bit more about that risk case, but first, Tom, let me talk to you and talk about this relatively benign outlook that Jan depicted as our base case. And look, it's a friendly backdrop for risk assets, but markets have already run very strongly. Valuation, arguably, is quite stretched. So is this good news already priced in? Yeah, look, I think that's exactly the right place to focus, he said, on an outright basis. The backdrop that Jan just presented is a pretty friendly one. You've got robust U.S. growth. You've got basically falling U.S. inflation over that period. You've got rate cuts continuing without recession. You've got corporate-friendly policies coming, most likely. And there's also a pretty strong flavor of U.S. outperformance within that. But even outside the U.S., I would say our baseline forecast is sort of stable-ish growth, with lower rate cuts, falling inflation. I think the big challenge, as you mentioned, is we're very clearly above other forecasters in terms of our U.S. growth outlook, but the market has already moved in that direction. If you look over the last couple of months, we've seen equities up. We've seen yields up. We've seen cyclical parts of the equity market outperform. We've seen the dollar stronger, and we've seen this sort of U.S. outperformance come through. And I would say some of that predates the election. Some of that is that we worried about recession risks in the late summer, seems like a while ago now, but that risk has faded. But taking out that risk was the sort of first leg of it, but we've clearly pushed further in that direction since the election. And so when we look at the judgment and the gap between what we're saying and what's priced, I think our judgment is still that at the margin, our growth view is more positive and this mix of growth inflation more positive than the market is yet pricing, and that that U.S. outperformance theme is still not fully reflected. So our central case, that kind of baseline situation, we still think you've got some upside to equities, you've got some upside to the dollar, you've got some outperformance of non-U.S. bonds and European bond yields falling relative to the U.S. But I would say that judgment is much more finely balanced than before. I think we're going to be much more conscious of when the market kind of questions that and the distribution of risks that Jan hinted at, that's going to be a much more important part of the investment picture than before. And with that context in mind, Jan, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the Fed outlook. We're obviously coming up on the December FOMC. You expect another 25 basis point cut. But as I said earlier, there is a lot of concern about the inflation trajectory. Bond yields, as you just said, Dom, have jumped pretty dramatically. So are you concerned at all that inflation could prove stickier and that could put a wedge into the Fed's policy trajectory from here? That's definitely possible. And, of course, monetary policy is a very pragmatic business. So you're going to have to respond to new information on inflation and on the economy. One point I would just make, though, that's, I think, very important and is often misunderstood, is that strong growth by itself is not really a reason for the Fed not to move. Their mandate is focused on labor market conditions, not on GDP growth. Those two are obviously related. But if you look at 2024, we've had growth significantly above their own expectations, market expectations, even our expectations. But nevertheless, the labor market has rebalanced and labor market utilization has declined on net. We're probably still in a process where labor market rebalancing is still continuing. And there's some risk. I think that we'll see further deceleration in the labor market and ultimately a situation where they really won't find it appropriate to have the funds rate at levels that are, by their estimates, very clearly in restrictive territory. And I think that's one reason why they will want to continue cutting rates. At the December meeting, we do expect a 25 basis point cut. That's not obviously a certainty. There's still data to be released that could change. But that is our expectation. And then we have ongoing cuts in early 2025, cuts in January and March, and then a slow down to once a quarter in Q2 and Q3, which take us down to the three and a quarter to three and a half percent range by the end of the third quarter. And there are risks around those. If we saw more labor market deceleration, I think they might continue to go a little bit more quickly. But it's certainly possible that inflation will prove to be a little bit stickier. Certainly on the surface, it's going to look like more inflation, although you could also make the argument that an increase in the inflation indices that's really just driven by tariffs is a one-off price increase like a value-added tax hike that monetary policymakers should not necessarily put a lot of weight on. So it's going to really depend on the numbers and on where they think that an appropriate monetary policy is based on inflation and the labor market. And I feel good about the idea that we'll get a reasonable amount of additional rate cuts, given that the funds rate at the moment is still pretty high at four and a half to four and three quarters. COLLEEN O'BRIEN And Dom, it's pretty striking to me that even as policy rates have come down, and we continue to expect them to come down, and the market in general also expects them to continue to come down. We have seen this big repricing in bond yields recently. So do you think bond yields have gone too far at this point? I mean, at 440, 450 in the 10 year? DOMINIC Yeah, look, we definitely have a group of people who are worried a lot about a big spike in bond yields and a further spike in bond yields coming out of the election. And we've generally been less worried about that than I think a lot of investors have. As Jan described, we have a fiscal impulse. We don't have a very large fiscal impulse coming down the pipe. We have a Fed forecast that is now clearly below the market on the kind of baseline case. And so those are things that should anchor you lower. And if you look at what we're forecasting for the 10 year yield over the course of 2025, it is somewhat lower, modestly lower, I would say, than we're seeing right here. I would say I don't have a huge fight to pick with the level of bond yields. I think part of what happened and part of this sort of surge that we've seen is coming off levels that we thought were too low. The market did worry in August and September about recession risks that Jan and the team were pretty clear were not in the offing. And so I think a decent part of that yield move has come really coming out of that position. Like I said, maybe a little high to our central case, but I would say not yet at a level that we think looks particularly odd. So we are now here again, as I said, flirting was 4.5 on the 10 year. That is high. I mean, at what level does that become problematic for the equity bull case that you presented? Yeah. Well, that's a good question a lot. And I would say there are kind of two answers. There's a sort of local answer and a bigger picture answer. The local answer is usually that the market cares a lot about pace of movement. So if there was expectation actually coming out of the election that we would see with a Republican sweep a sharper and faster move higher in bond yields. And I think in some ways, the fact that we haven't seen that has probably been one of the things that has helped the equity market to move higher. So that could reappear. But at the moment, we're not really pushing quickly higher over these sort of recent periods. The yields have sort of steadied out. The bigger thing for us is generally like what is driving the yield increase. And as I said, a large part of that first leg of increase in yields that we've seen since September has been about relaxing about growth. If this is coming from a market that's getting more optimistic about growth, more optimistic about the kind of policy outlook and you're driving equities and bond yields higher together in general, that's a more digestible and manageable situation. I think what will be more damaging for the equity market is if the worries shift either back towards inflation or towards this sort of notion of fiscal risk. So if we start to see the market worry about the yield path because it thinks the inflation profile is getting stickier or worries that there's a sort of fiscal problem that it needs to be taken into account more, that's a further leg of yields that will be more damaging, I think, and more difficult for equities to shake off. We generally, as Jan described, have a more benign view in the central case of how those things should evolve. So it's not a large worry, but to the extent that there's a risk kind of lurking there in the bond market, I think you need that driver of yields to shift to something that is more clearly negative. And I think if it's just the kind of growth environment driving, we'll probably be able to manage it. Well, and the other risk in our base case is valuation already being quite stretched across risky assets. So should that be a concern? Yeah, look, and again, that's something that David Koston and the team have highlighted. Valuations are high, they're high in equities, the credit spreads are tight. And so that's part of the story, again, of having taken credit for a lot of the good news. But there is a horizon issue with weighting valuations. If you look over kind of 10-year periods, those sort of long horizons, this tells you that your prospective returns on risky assets are going to be lower than normal. That's what David and the team found. That's a pretty reasonable conclusion from the starting point that we have. Your ability to tell you where we're going over the next 12 months, maybe even the next couple of years, is much, much lower from valuation alone. We saw this year, you came in with pretty high starting valuations. But if the cyclical backdrop is strong enough, then that's usually what dominates. And I would say what we've tended to find is that you pay that price for equity valuations disproportionately when the cycle turns down. So our expectation is that's not what we're going to see in 2025. If that's true, you can kind of probably manage this situation where valuations are high. It means that you're vulnerable to being wrong on that. If we're wrong about that assumption, if something happens that puts the economy into a more difficult place than we think on a central case, you could find that you see a disproportionate reaction to that. And we saw maybe hints of that in August when the market panicked about recession risk. So that tale is worth thinking about, worth protecting against. But in the central case, I think, you know, our view is that this is a longer term problem, but not necessarily an obstacle for the next 12 or 18 months, given the kind of cyclical backdrop we're talking about. And Jan, let's then dig into that risk case, which primarily, in our view, revolves around policy developments more extreme than what we are currently assuming. So what could that look like and what are the implications or might be the implications for growth? Yeah, I'd say that's the key known unknown, what is going to happen to tariff policy. There are obviously also unknown unknowns. And overall, when we look at the risk of a recession, since we always provide an estimate of that, looking forward 12 months, we're at 15 percent. That's not a big number. It's below the consensus as it has been throughout the last couple of years. And it's only about in line with the long term average since there's been a recession about once every seven years in the postwar period. We think that the probability of a higher tariff, key known unknown, a 10 percent, let alone maybe even 20 percent across the board tariff, we think that probability is pretty high, but it's not quite the baseline. So Alec Phillips, our chief political economist, is of the view that, you know, it's maybe around 40 percent. It's certainly very possible that the Trump administration ultimately imposes an across the board tariff, but more likely that there will be negotiations. And in the end, there is not such a tariff. If it does happen, we think it would hit growth pretty hard. We're getting a negative growth impulse of somewhere around one percentage point. And obviously, when that peaks depends on when exactly it would be implemented. Alec thinks it probably would take a little bit longer than the China tariffs, which could happen very soon after inauguration. But it might take another, say, six months or so before a universal tariff would actually occur. But then the growth impact around a percentage point, and we think the inflation impact is probably also around a percentage point as it happens. So it's a more difficult environment from the perspective of certainly the growth inflation tradeoff, more unfriendly for sure. From a monetary policy perspective, it's a little bit complicated because these things go in opposite directions. And I think it is worth noting that, again, this is a price level effect. The impact on inflation of even a pretty sizable tariff shock, it lasts for 12 months, but then barring ongoing escalation, it should drop out of the numbers. So I think it would make sense in that sort of environment for monetary policy to also focus on the downside risks to the growth side. And this is what we saw in early 2019 when the Fed was faced with a trade policy shock and decided to cut three times. Now, that was a different situation. Inflation was much lower. The funds rate was also much lower. So it's not necessarily what would happen, that this would precipitate additional easing, but it certainly could. And I wouldn't want to go into this kind of episode with a sort of strong ideological view on which way tariffs should affect monetary policy. It's really going to depend on a lot of factors. But it will increase the uncertainty around the interest rate path as well, for sure. And, Dom, if we get an announcement that we're going to have a 10 or 20% across-the-board tariff, what do U.S. assets do? Yeah, I mean, the clearer and larger impact is on non-U.S. assets. I would say for the U.S., the thing we think is clearest is the impact on the dollar. We've estimated dollar outcomes under different assumptions and think that if you get a full shift to that across-the-board tariff, you should see meaningfully further dollar appreciation than we've seen. I don't think it's moved in that direction, but we think it's priced something much more like a narrowly focused agenda at this point. I think the impact, reflecting a little bit what Jan said about monetary policy, I think the impact on other U.S. asset markets is less clear. I think the full risk case and the threat of retaliation to that could, I think, weigh on U.S. equities, you know, clearer overseas, but could weigh on U.S. equities. And I think in the end, we'll probably push U.S. yields lower like it did in 2019, but the distribution and variance of those outcomes is definitely going to go up. And I think it's just easier to be confident about FX than the others. Well, Jan, let's talk a little bit about ex-U.S., Europe and China already experiencing economic challenges and now are facing the threat of some policy shifts ahead that could be unfriendly. Let's start with Europe. What's our mainline view and what are the risks around that? We're below consensus on Europe. We're not forecasting a recession, but we definitely have below consensus and actually below trend growth in the euro area, looking for 0.8% for 2025. The consensus is at 1.2%, the ECB is at 1.3%, so pretty clearly below. We did make a downgrade to our European growth forecast on the heels of the U.S. election outcome, basically because we found in our research over the last year that European companies are more sensitive to trade policy uncertainty than U.S. companies. So even though we don't have a universal baseline tariff in our forecast, and the only thing that really directly affects Europe is the potential auto tariff, we nevertheless felt that the increase in uncertainty and the potentially looming baseline tariff is already enough to take something like a half percentage point out of European growth on a Q4 to Q4 basis, or a few tenths at least, on an annual average basis. As I said, this is slightly below trend for the euro area, which is also why we expect the so far very strong European labor market to slow, and we do see at least a small increase in the unemployment rate in the euro area. From an inflation perspective, we don't think that the tariffs and the likely retaliation against the tariffs is really going to move the needle. We think we'll continue to see declines in inflation back to 2% for core inflation by the end of next year, and that means from a monetary policy perspective, it's much less complicated in Europe than in the U.S. It's a negative growth shock, but not really an inflation shock, and so I think the ECB is going to continue easing, and we actually added 25 basis points of easing to our forecast. We're now at 175 by late 2025. And what about China? In China, we also made a small downgrade to our growth forecast. We're at 4.5%. That's actually in line with the consensus, and it is not a huge downgrade. We only shaved two-tenths from our pre-election forecast because we're assuming that while the increase in tariffs could subtract as much as seven-tenths from growth, we expect more than half of that to be offset by additional policy easing along some of the same lines that we have already seen over the last couple of months, easier monetary policy, probably some additional rate cuts, increased lending by banks that are effectively state-directed, and easier fiscal policy. So we do think that the headwinds for China, not just from trade policy, but also from the property downturn and the demographics, those headwinds are likely to be pretty serious, but policy is now also making more of an effort to offset some of those headwinds. And Dami, you alluded to this, but for all the reasons Jan just laid out, you are more cautious on assets outside of the U.S. Yeah, I think that's particularly because of that risk case. I mean, I think that's true in the central case, but it's obviously clearer in that risk case. I think there's a bit of a differentiation reflecting what Jan just mentioned about the risks for Europe and for China. I think there's been a lot of focus on the prospect of China tariffs. That's part of our baseline. It's part of a lot of people's baselines and expectations that that's coming are pretty high. We saw in 2019 that the actual announcement of tariffs still moved markets, particularly for the Chinese currency. So you could still get reaction to that. But I would say overall markets feel better prepared for that as the outcome in China related areas. And so it's a little bit, as we discussed before, that the risks really are this across the board kind of tariff outcomes, that that's the risk that would lead to, I think, more significant further repricing and in line with what Jan just laid out. I think that's particularly true for the incremental impact on Europe and some of the non-China economies in the emerging market space. I mentioned the dollar, which is obviously both the U.S. and a non-U.S. asset. So further depreciation in other currencies against the dollar likely in that case, but I would say also meaningful downside potentially in non-U.S. equities, particularly those sort of non-China equities that have perhaps reflected less of that risk already. And we also think that bond yields in line with the notion that the ECB and others would probably cut rates more quickly, as Jan described, to respond to those growth risks that bond yields in Europe could then fall more sharply. So it's another reason for thinking that bonds and European bonds may be better diversifiers in portfolios than treasuries, that they have some ability to rally further in one of those major risk cases. When I put this all together, it seems like investors right now should be feeling generally pretty good, especially investors in U.S. assets. And we think that that's going to continue. But it's tricky because the downside risks feel very meaningful. So how do you think investors should be positioning relative to this outlook? Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly the right way to describe the challenge, which is basic view is you want at some level to be maintaining this theme of exposure to the U.S. growth resilience that we still expect and to the further upside that we think probably still exists in equities, particularly U.S. equities as that happens. And then you've got two risks to contend with. One is, is the market at a point where it's reflecting that already? And the other is these tail risks that we've focused on tariffs and perhaps some of the other risks that we touched on. And I would say in some ways, that's a continuation of 2024. We have had a similar view that you're trying to keep your exposure to that U.S. growth theme while also being sensible about the tail risks that might appear and protect yourself against it. But the key risks are a little bit different. I would say we're still in the mode where, again, because the market's taking credit for this, you're going to feel better fading worries. Probably not the tariff worry. That's the one we would probably say, as we've outlined, is a serious worry that needs to be taken. But if the market worries about other aspects of the growth and inflation view, in general, our bias is going to be to push back against that. It's easier to find opportunity when the market is worrying about things than when the market is not worrying about things. But in terms of the broader setup, I would say there are two things you can do to help yourself with that exposure. One is diversification across assets. We think that even with some of this inflation and risk and fiscal risk that bonds, particularly non-U.S. bonds, as I mentioned, if you hedge the FX part of it, offer good protection against an equity portfolio for some of these risks. And I think even U.S. treasuries and TIPS, we expect modest positive total returns and they could help if growth disappoints. We've talked on the equity side about broadening out the U.S. equity exposure towards a more equal allocation and mitigating some of that concentration risk that has appeared. But I do think keeping this long dollar exposure against long equity positions both fits the broad direction of travel that we have in our base case, but also hedges you against some of these tariff risk cases, U.S. rate upside cases that could be more difficult for equities. The other thing I would say is we think there's strong arguments still also for looking at options protection to also help you protect against those macro tails. You've seen the price of optionality in the major markets come down after the election, which is something that we expected to happen. And so it's easier to use options both in equities and in terms of expressing some of those long dollar views, maybe also in commodities, gold and oil, which we haven't really touched on, but as protection against some of those key risks. And so we think for investors who are able to do that, who have mandates to do that, that using options either to express the views that you want to or to protect them is also going to be a thing that's worth a higher level of focus than usual. Dom, Jan, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Tuesday, November 19th, 2024. I'm your host, Alison Nathan.

When a team was sold and ownership changed hands, the new owner was usually just one person. Sometimes, that ownership would also include a few friends and family members. Institutions, like hedge funds or private equity firms, were not allowed to participate in buying a team. And those were still the rules in the National Football League when Apollo co-founder Josh Harris bought the Washington Commanders in 2023. The NFL was quite restrictive as to, they only would allow you a certain number of owners. And then, obviously, their rules, in essence, vest all of the power, the control, if you will, in one person because they want to make sure that someone can make decisions on behalf of the teams. But these teams are a lot more expensive than they used to be. In the NFL alone, valuations have tripled in just 10 years. In 2014, the Buffalo Bills traded for $1.4 billion. The Panthers traded for two and change. And then, in, I think, 2022, the Broncos traded for high fours. Then, obviously, we bought the Commanders at six 18 months ago. So buying or investing in a team now requires, quite simply, a lot more capital. And over the past 15 years, the professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Europe have slowly loosened ownership rules to allow private equity and other institutional money to provide this capital. In some leagues, institutions can buy a minority stake, while in other leagues, it allows for full ownership. But when Josh Harris was preparing a bid for the Washington Commanders, the NFL was the holdout. It was the only major league that didn't allow private equity in team ownership. So Harris assembled a group of individual investors to raise and invest approximately $5 billion of equity for that deal. I think that everyone realized that that was very hard to do and that they thought that it was time to allow for more capital going into the business. And about one year after the Commanders deal closed, the NFL finally embraced the trend and made it possible for a select group of institutions to invest in its teams. When the NFL made that choice, it meant that private equity now had access to every major sports league across both the U.S. and Europe. It marked a new era in the business of sports, one that is already changing how teams are run, how athletes are paid, how games are watched, and even the very nature of fandom. This is Investing in Sports, a miniseries from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast about the changing dynamics at the intersection of sports and finance. I'm Nicole Pullen-Ross. I lead the private wealth management business for the New York region at Goldman Sachs, and I also head our sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management. Over the next four episodes, I'll be speaking to my colleagues who work across the business of sports for Goldman Sachs. We'll also have the opportunity to hear from team owners and leaders who are at the forefront of the transformation happening across the industry. We'll cover the new ownership landscape and how streaming is changing the way we watch sports. In the disruption we're seeing, the whole business model has, in effect, been turned upside down. The total addressable market for sports is the population of the world. They're recognizing they've got to make the product interesting. They have to make it vital to the user, to the viewer. What it takes to build a fan experience of the future. This was going to be a basketball mecca. It was going to be all about the game. It's arena on steroids. The growth in women's sports and what all of this means for investors. I think it needs to be patient capital, but I think that capital will see a return. The evolution of the sports ecosystem continues to expand. What it's going to be in five years, just put your seatbelt on and get on for the ride. Welcome to the revolution. In our first episode, I'll be sitting down with Commanders owner Josh Harris to ask how his approach to sports is so much different than his other investments. But before that, I'm pleased to be joined by two of my Goldman Sachs colleagues from our sports investment banking team, Dave Dassey, who's the global co-head of sports investment banking and Ellis Jones, our head of sports advisory. We'll talk about how sports became big business, the way institutional investors are thinking about sports as an investment opportunity, and what the scale of this opportunity could look like over the next few years. Dave, Ellis, we spend a lot of time together given our shared client base. It is a pleasure to have you both here today. It's great to be here, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. So Ellis, we work with clients who explore a broad range of investment opportunities. Sports can be different. What is unique about sports as an investment? I think that's absolutely right. The reality is the sports market has an addressable market of just shy of 8 billion people. It touches every corner of the world. And over the last 15, 16 years, the penetration of that distribution network has grown immeasurably. I mean, it's only 2007 that the iPhone was introduced. If you think about our transition from 3G to 4G to 5G networks and the ability to transfer data at much lower latencies has meant that we can access more people. We're able to touch all four corners of the world. Sport touches almost everyone in some form or another. It's a hugely important pillar to society. And that was most evident through COVID, not only in the absence of not being able to watch, but also participate in sport. And I think the spotlight was shone on the industry as a non-cyclical, high revenue generating industry that people wanted more of. And whether that was demonstrated with the non-scripted media that came through the streamers through that period, whether it was the all or nothing series with Amazon or indeed Drive to Survive with Netflix, it shone a light on how important it was. But in many instances, sport is not moved at the same pace of change of other industries, particularly tech. And so the opportunity to grow and the opportunity to invest and the opportunity to increase value at different parts of the ecosystem has been very evident to people. And that's why I think all of the capital has spent time and an increasing amount of time on the industry. It's quite a lot that sets sports apart from other investments. So Dave, what have you observed in the US in terms of institutional capital looking to get exposure to sports? I think this in large part is very consistent with what we've seen in terms of this booming growth of the private capital markets and the evolution we've seen across other sectors as well. But as you think about returns and what they're focused on, these returns historically have been very uncorrelated to other returns in the marketplace, which is attractive. These are very long duration oriented type assets. And so these are 25, 50, 75, 100 year assets. And so a lot of this institutional capital or family office capital or quite frankly, sovereign wealth or insurance capital is very, very long dated. So there's an alignment of interest there. In North America, the leagues have very strong governance, which makes it restrictive in terms of how much capital can come in today. But it also sets these businesses up such that you actually know what you're buying. You know the operating model. You understand what the cost can be. And you certainly understand the revenues which come in on a consistent basis. You know in large part what those are going to be. And historically, those revenues have grown very, very aggressively through cycles from a digital rights distribution perspective. The scarcity element to it is still very, very appealing. It's historically been a billionaire's club in terms of who can buy these. But the number of deck of billionaires around the world, the number of billionaires around the world is growing much faster than the number of North American franchises in the major sports. We'll talk about women's sports and some of the adjacent areas as well because there's a lot of capital that's moving into those areas. And I think people have a fundamental sense that as capital comes in, there's going to continue to be this evolution in terms of how do you capitalize these entities. Today, they capitalize very conservatively, very low loan-to-value rates given the franchise value of these. And over time, I suspect that will change. There will be more creativity in terms of what you can put into how you finance the purchase of an asset or how you own an asset which will drive down the cost of capital which in theory should help drive up valuations. And so there's definitely a lot to like from that perspective. Yeah. Ellis, the picture outside of North America can be a little different. Dave talked about governance, ability to capitalize as themes that are present in the North American markets for sure. How would you characterize the rest of the world? Different. The irony of the egalitarian position of the major US leagues to ownership and distribution of revenues in a more equal fashion is frankly very different to the other leagues and propositions around the rest of the world. And as a result of that, we've seen a far greater mix of capital come into European sports. If we look at the Soccer Premier League in the UK, we have a real mix of equity owners and capital providers across the ecosystem already. We have ultra high net worth and that has historically been the case. We've seen the success of sovereign wealth coming into ownership of franchises, firstly with Man City, most notably, and then latterly with the PIF in Newcastle to name but two. But we've also seen institutional capital. So when we look at the likes of Liverpool with their ownership by Fenway, this has been around for some time. It's not new. And most notably, it's in a majority position. And so that story has been there. Unfortunately, the real difference is not all of those business generate free cash flow and have had the same success as the U.S. And that has been demonstrated by the difference in valuation perspectives. And so actually, you get a far greater differentiation in values and a lot more uncertainty. But it's right to say that there is an element of greater maturity of different forms of capital in non-U.S. sports than we've seen in U.S. sports today, who've been far more thoughtful, perhaps at times, as to how they introduce that capital. OK, we've touched on a few of the major changes that have made sports an attractive investment opportunity. So let me sum them up. First, scarcity. There are a limited number of professional teams, yet the number of billionaires has increased. Second, the growth in media rights revenue. Take the NFL, for example. The annual value of the NFL's media rights contract was $2.2 billion in 2000. Today, the annual value of its current contract is $10 billion. Third, leagues have slowly opened up to private equity and institutional capital. And four, as a result, there's been substantial growth in team valuations. For major U.S. men's leagues, compound annual growth rates are between 10% and 14%. That's the broad picture. What's been most interesting to you? Look, from my perspective, I think these assets were underappreciated in terms of them being true businesses and were thought of more as a sports franchise. Today, and many of the owners who have bought in over the last 10, 15 years have thought of these as operating businesses, which not only are games and content, but also have all the ancillary elements to it. So you talked about the sports rights and the significant growth and trajectory from that perspective. The ability to aggregate audience, which has made the live programming that much more scarce, which has driven up the advertising in terms of really wanting to get exposure and get access to this live content. We talk about social in these viral moments. The 24-7 nature of it, the players as stars and personalities, not only in the sports realm, but increasingly crossing over into music, entertainment, etc. We've gotten to a point where I think assets are plus or minus in that zone of being fairly valued today. I think the returns will still continue to be very, very good, but it's been incredible in terms of what these returns have looked like over the last decade or so. I'd love to flip for a minute forward a page and look at the implications of the trends that we've seen and the changes that we've seen. Dave, you talked a little bit about how some teams' owners have really led the teams in various leagues and the leagues themselves to be operating businesses. And I think some would argue that for many years, to your point, these assets have been looked at as generational assets. And so we're starting to hear more and more of this concept of how sports is becoming more professionalized, if you will. And so if we think about conversations you're having following the capital, where are clients focused right now? Where are you seeing capital most deployed at this point? I think increasingly, capital is looking for multiple paths to potentially make money, not inconsistent with how investors look or how private equity firms look at other businesses. And so buying a team, but is there potentially a stadium alternative? Building a city around the stadium or the arena? Is there the ability to invest, or is it a platform that could be multi-sport team ownership? Probably seven out of 10 that are multi-team ownership. And so having multiple teams owned, is that attractive? Do you get diversification? Do you get access to more fans, more data, more analytics, which allows you to build on these direct-to-consumer models? So I think there's certainly one theme. And then I wouldn't call them secondary sports, but the smaller sports, the sports-adjacent stuff, the gaming, the ticketing, the data and analytics, the healthcare businesses that are around sports. There's a lot of really interesting capital that's going in. Youth sports is a big potential growth area, a roll-up opportunity. And so I think the capital is looking to go into, quite frankly, the entire ecosystem. I'll add to that with regards to, if you take Formula One, for example, Liberty Media took that business on in 2016, frankly speaking, have taken that to a whole new place with the entertainment factor, bringing effectively 24 races around the world, on average watched by 70 million people per race. When you compare that to the Super Bowl at 110 million, it's quite staggering. When you think of the forms of capital coming into that, you have people looking at the teams, both in equity and credit. But furthermore, what is quite interesting is the commercial opportunity. So the commercial upside on sponsorship, and whilst that isn't direct ownership, that is huge with regards to capital, helping the teams fund themselves and grow and outperform. And of course, that's driven higher valuations. When I talked about entertainment earlier, this is the case study 101. We had COVID, we had Netflix, we had Drive to Survive, taking that sport to a completely different audience, lowering the age of the eyeball, which gives it a much bigger consumer opportunity for everyone, whether it's the teenager who's never watched it in North America to those who followed it for decades, but are able to get more data and analytics delivered to them through the content that is provided. Yeah, it's a really great example of how leagues and teams have become media brands, and how in an era of direct-to-consumer content, storytelling by these brands will be really important. We're going to cover that a lot more in our next episode. For now, Ellis, from your perspective, what are some other areas for growth? Yeah, the key point here is about increasing revenues, managing costs, and finding different ways to deliver greater utility. And of course, more often than that comes at a cost to the consumer or at a price to the consumer. And so when we think about the ecosystem as a whole, whether you're at the league level, the franchise level, or otherwise, finding new ways to make money are going to be critical to that success. And the sports-adjacent market and the sports-adjacent business market is going to be critical. We've already seen it in many aspects. When you look at the success of Fanatics in its distribution of merchandise and otherwise, we've talked about the convergence with the entertainment industry, but the producers and how that's impacted by the influence of the streamers and so forth. And then, of course, the big thing in America right now is the growth of the US sports betting market. Now, interestingly, that is a mature market, particularly in the UK or elsewhere in the world. There are some markets where it doesn't exist, and it's more about fantasy. But if you think about the proliferation of betting in the US market over the last few years, it's been huge. So given that, how should investors think about the scale of all of that if you put the various pieces all together? I mean, I've heard estimates ranging from $630 billion to a trillion dollars. Some recent reports put it at $3 trillion. How do you get there? Give us a little bit of perspective on how big this can be from your vantage point. I think I touched upon it earlier when I said the total addressable market for sports is the population of the world in some form or another. When I think you look at the US and you look at the average revenue per fan, per franchise within the NFL, it is already pretty high. And if you then break down where they're consuming and where they're spending their money at each point, it's pretty demonstrable in that effect. When you look at that across other sports, they're still relatively nascent and still immature in many ways around how they monetize the average revenue per user. If you look at the Premier League alone, it is said that over 3 billion of the world's population engage in the Premier League on a regular basis. The Premier League runs for somewhere between 38, 40 weeks of the year. It sits on time zone zero, so it is watched actively in Asia, very actively across Europe, and now increasingly in America. And that's demonstrated by the increase in media rights, particularly outside of the UK. But those media rights are still less than half of the annual media rights of the NFL, a sport that has half the number of weeks in which it operates in. And when you then dissect where the fan is actively consuming and paying to consume, you'll find that the average revenue per fan is much, much lower. So as an investor and you dissect the ecosystem, what you're really looking for are those opportunities that can really drive that revenue increase and where it can be done in a profitable way as opposed to where in the past there's been a higher cost relative to the revenue earned. You all have painted a very vivid picture around the entire ecosystem and the opportunity that exists. Speak for a minute about some of the challenges that investors should be considering. What do you worry about, given where valuations are? What are some of the flashing yellow lights that investors should be considering? Look, I think media rights have spiked dramatically, right? So you've seen two, two and a half, three times step up each time we've gone through this. The disruption that is taking place in these business models, the legacy media companies aren't in the position they used to be. The technology companies, they've been coming into the sports ecosystem. I think that dynamic sets up very, very well for those rights and those distribution rights to continue to grow at an accelerated pace. But there may be a world where you don't get as much competition from that. And so you get a more modest step up or increase in terms of those distribution rights. I think to the extent you're going into a league or a team, governance is critically, critically important in terms of what's the decision making body? How does it make decisions? What is the growth plan for the league as well as for the teams? Because that can really put guardrails around what could go poorly from that perspective. One thing I spent a lot of time thinking about, and Ellis talked a lot about Formula One, how many sports are really going to be able to punch through to this next level? We are living in a world today where the strongest, from a sports perspective, I think are getting stronger. The biggest brands in those leagues are getting bigger and stronger. The days of a sports team being local, they then went to regional, then to national. The biggest and best brands now are global brands. There's probably 15 or 20 teams across all different sports around the globe that are truly global. How much shelf space is there really for some of these other sports to punch through? I think for them to get these dramatic step function increases and valuations, they're going to need to garner some of that 8 billion people. But that doesn't mean many of the smaller emerging leagues, women's sports, etc., there's huge upside, huge opportunity, and huge runway before they have to worry about, in essence, punching through and taking on some of the big three. Ellis, anything you'd like to add in terms of challenges on the horizon to be on the lookout for? The derivation of sports were as community assets. They belong to people. They belong to the fans. You need capital to grow, and you need capital to compete. What really matters to the fans is they're performing on the pitch. But the reality of that is there are legacy decisions and governance, particularly outside of the United States, that are more challenging to overcome. So when people are looking at investing in sport and where they're going to invest in the sport and the type of capital they're investing, they've got to understand the sport. They've got to understand the asset they're buying, and they've got to understand the fans. And ultimately, those who are investing need to be mindful of how quickly they can make a difference, how quickly they can implement a difference, and what is their real return. People are not necessarily going to be overly happy if a team is underperforming, but there are returns being paid out in dividends to owners. They want to see their teams perform, and you need those people to turn up to the stage in each week. What I do think is important and will drive the continued thoughtfulness around investing is more and more people are getting greater utility from engaging in this sports ecosystem. It brings the happy factor. And if there are people that can facilitate that growth and facilitate people's enjoyment of going to a game, watching a game, watching a game within a saturated weekend, those will be the winners, because they'll have taken what actually makes the fan enjoy the opportunity of watching sport. Great. Dave, Ellis, thank you for a very enlightening conversation. We'll look forward to continuing the discussion. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nico. I'm a value investor. I buy things at seven times cash flow, or I try to create mid-teens yields. In sports, you're never going to do that. I'm very excited about my next guest, who might be best known to our listeners as one of the most prominent private equity investors of our time. Josh Harris co-founded Apollo Global Management and recently founded alternative investment firm 26 North. And prior to that, in 2017, he and longtime business partner David Blitzer founded Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment. Over the past 15 years, he's also assembled a very impressive portfolio of professional sports teams. He's acquired an NBA team, an NHL team, a stake in an English Premier League team, and most recently, an NFL team, with his record-setting purchase of the Washington Commanders. I started by asking him how important it was to have a personal connection to the teams he's invested in. I think sports is a community endeavor. Some of my greatest memories, you know, in Washington, truthfully, I remember literally being eight years old and watching the 1972 Super Bowl and then going up to Penn as a freshman and watching, you know, the Sixers win the NBA title with Dr. Jay Mosbon and Maurice Cheeks and Andrew Toney. And I witnessed all of that. And I saw the community come together in Washington and Philly. And so I share, I'm a fan. So I understand the frustration when the team's not winning. I understand, you know, what it means to be able to own the teams I grew up with. It's a dream come true. I'd love to go back to your first investment in sports back in 2011 when you did the deal for the Philadelphia 76ers. Talk to us a little bit about the catalyst for that and kind of what spurred that initial investment. Look, to go back to 2011, 2010, the Sixers were owned by Comcast Spectacore, which is obviously a huge, important company. They were a cable business. And I just literally called Comcast and, you know, started dialing. And then 18 months later, I was able to acquire the Sixers. We did it in a so-called corporate carveout. And the NBA at that point was going into a lockout. And the Sixers were losing $25 to $30 million a year. And they were low 20s out of 30 teams in the NBA at that point in terms of revenue. But I just felt that this was something I wanted to do. I wanted to bring the Sixers back to where I had witnessed them during their glory years. I just said, look, we got to do this. I put together a group. I enlisted David Blitzer, who's a, you know, now we own this company together. And we bought the Sixers. And basically, fast forward, the Sixers are now, like, I don't know how many years ago, like, fifth in revenues in the league. And we reconnect the city. We're an elite team. We're really hopeful. But I had so much fun doing that, that we then went on to do other things in sports. It was a life changer for me. I love that. It's interesting to hear you share the perspective of where the revenues were when you started and how much they've grown over time. It wasn't that long ago where a lot of investors thought about owning a sports team, really, as a trophy asset. The price to own one was obviously much different than it is today. I'd love to get your perspective as it relates to how you navigate the emotional side of investing in a sports team and the financial side. I read an interview that you did with the Washington Post. And it was about your first year as owner of the Washington Commanders. And in that interview, you said, I'm typically unemotional about financial decisions. But here, it was more emotional. So I'm curious what made running a team more emotional than making other financial decisions. And how did your experience help you approach that? Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, people do things for different reasons. For me personally, I was always emotional. I started off emotionally in sports with the Sixers. And I ended up emotionally involved with the Washington Commanders. But for me, when I get involved in these sports teams, and I have partners in all of them, I say to people, look, we're in this to win it. The currency in private equity is EBITDA and stock price and value creation. The currency in sports, to me, is creating memories and championships, right? And that's about experience. It's about having a great stadium and serving great food and all of it. And then it's about engaging with the cities in a positive way. And so all of those things are my currency in sports. And year in, year out, it's not the same as a financial investment. You want to have EBITDA, no. You're going to do what you have to do to win. And if the cities think that you're in it for them, they support you, right? They think you're in it for money. They don't support you. You got to be in this for the right reasons, which I think are, even though I own these assets, I view myself as a steward for the cities. And you can't do this on the cheap. You got to be all in. And basically, invest to grow. And gold plated for the players, for the fans, for everyone, so that you set yourself up to have the best chance of winning. OK. So how do you think of sports as an investment? You can't worry about cash flow. You have to invest. And you have to be in it for the right reasons. But the investment case for sports, particularly the major sports, is that, depending on the sport, but I'll just use the NFL, 70% of the team is media, right? It's coming from the globalization, the fact that international, everyone in the world wants to watch the best audiences. So the audiences are globalizing. The fact that media content can now be delivered everywhere in the world, in many cases, more people watch the Sixers in China than watch them in Philly. I mean, there's just a massive following around the world. And that has propelled the revenues up. And it's a correlated, right? So if you look at the NFL, in 2014, the Buffalo Bills traded for $1.4 billion. And then the Panthers traded for two and change. And then 2022, the Broncos traded for high fours. And obviously, we bought the Commanders at six 18 months ago. So it's tripled in 10 years. The NFL has such massive media presence. But if you looked at the NBA or the NHL, and you look at the growth in Forbes or Sportico, whatever, you'll see that these have been good investments. And other people might say, OK, well, I want to manage to the bottom line. This is not how we do it. I like them as part of a portfolio. But I say to everyone, because we have partners, look, not everyone feels the way that I do. And I say, look, this is my investment case. We might spend to win. We're going to spend to invest and make everything. But here's the story around global media. And that element exists in sports. I think it is quite a good investment. Tell me a little bit, as you talk about the Commanders, you made the decision to accelerate capital deployment there. What did you see? What sort of things does it make sense to invest in that way versus areas where you'd be more cautious? Yeah. So when we got there, obviously, it had been a complicated situation. We saw a lot of things that we should and could invest in. And the way I look at it is, I view the stadium as our house, right? This is what I say to my partners. And I view our fans as honored guests, right? And so we've come in and tried to do a lot of different things at once to upgrade the fan experience. I mean, obviously, the best thing we can do is win football games. But you know what? There's 31 other teams that also have that same goal. So we're really hard at work at that. But while we're doing that, what we're doing is hitting the stadium really hard right now. Everything from fixing infrastructure and elevators and stairwells and concrete and bathrooms to creating better premium experiences to trying to get better at ingress and egress into the stadium. So it's a broad program. We're spending about $80 million on it. And then the other thing we're doing is in the training ground, right, in Virginia, in Ashburn, there's a small fraternity of NFL players. It's truly elite, right? So what we want to be is a place where they say, wow, this ownership really cares. It's a good place to play. And so I want to make their life as easy as possible. And so we're fixing the weight room and showers and setting up player areas. And look, we have a ways to go. We have a lot of work to do. And it doesn't happen overnight. And then obviously, we do the best we can with our old stadium. But the reality is it's an old stadium, right? And everything has changed so much since it was built that the fan experience is just better in some of these newer stadiums, right? And there's only so much you can do. So we're looking, we're working hard at that, obviously. But like, you know, that's what we're doing right now. Okay, Josh, my final question for you. And I really think there are few better position to answer this question. I'd like to talk about private equity in sports, particularly in the NFL. Of course, and after much anticipation, the NFL was ultimately the last league in the U.S. to allow institutional capital. And it happened not long after you completed the deal to buy the Commanders. What do you expect to see given this new introduction of capital? And where do you expect to see the most significant impact? Listen, the NFL was quite restrictive as to, they only would allow a certain number of owners. And then obviously, the rules in all the sports leagues, you know, in essence, vest all of the power, the control, if you will, in one person, because they want to make sure that someone can make decisions on behalf of the teams. So that made it a harder investment case. And I think them going through the process with us, when we bought the Washington Commanders, they figured out that, forget about the Forbes 400, that it was the Forbes 50, right? Where the ability to write a $5 billion check wasn't there. And what separated us was, you know, the fact that we had been good stewards, both financially to our partners, but also to the cities, and also the strength of Washington, right? And the strength of the NFL. And that allowed us to raise a lot of money. But I think that everyone realized that that was very hard to do. And that they thought that it was time to allow for more capital going into the business. Increasingly, these are big businesses, right? They're big global media businesses. And the purchase price on sports teams is accelerating. And sports teams, because they don't make a lot of cash flow, they make some, in some cases, you can't put a lot of leverage on sports teams. So they're really equity-driven investments. For us to do what we need to do, which is a stadium costs $3 to $5 billion now. And, you know, the purchase price of the Commanders, we had to raise and invest $5 billion of equity. So what private equity allows for is capital, right? It's just capital. And then also, as you move towards the technological innovation, whether it be understanding how to serve your customers better, there's an arms race, if you will, in the front office. So if you want to win, you got to be involved with analytics and investment and technology. And you don't want anyone to get an edge on you there, right? Sports is a very innovative place. And so I look at it as capital for investment to allow for the continuation of the growth in sports and doing what we do best, which is creating memories. Well, thank you, Josh, for what you do. And thank you for taking the time. My pleasure to be here. And thank you for taking your time to do this interview. The sports ownership landscape has changed considerably over the past 10 to 15 years, with private equity and other institutional capital now involved in every professional league across the U.S. and Europe. This larger pool of diversified capital is expected to play a significant role in the evolution of the sports industry. And it's a theme we'll return to throughout this series.

And one of the things I love the most about my job is that it gives me the chance to speak to some of the most interesting and insightful people in business, economics, and finance. And today's guest certainly qualifies. Rob Kaplan ran the Dallas Fed from 2015 to 2021. Before that, he was a professor at Harvard Business School and the global co-head of investment banking here at Goldman Sachs. Earlier this year, he rejoined Goldman Sachs as vice chairman, so I am proud to call him my colleague again. Today, Rob is joining me from our Dallas office to speak about the Fed's rate-cutting cycle, the interplay between monetary and fiscal policy, and what investors might be missing about this unique economic moment. Rob, thanks for being here. Great to be here with you, Allison. The Fed is continuing its cutting cycle. As we all know, it brought down the Fed funds rate by another 25 basis points last week, and it continues to try to walk this tightrope of bringing down inflation without tanking the economy. We'll get your views on what could be ahead, but let me first ask how good of a job you think the Fed has done so far in orchestrating a soft landing. It's done a good job in orchestrating a soft landing. Part of the thing that's helped them orchestrate that soft landing is that fiscal policy has been dramatically more accommodative, more stimulative than we're accustomed to. We've gone from pre-COVID 70% of GDP to over 100% of GDP debt of the U.S. government. But people have to realize post-COVID, 21, 22, and 23, we've had outsized fiscal spending, particularly these very large directed programs like the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act. That has helped the Fed. Now, on the other hand, it's caused the Fed to go higher than they thought they'd need to, five and a quarter, five and a half. It's caused them to stay there longer, and it's been stickier and slower for them to cut than they would have otherwise. But as of now, the economy is still growing, even in this high-rate environment. So would you judge it as generally a success? For financial market people and more affluent people, it's been a success. For something like 65 or 70 million workers in this country that go paycheck to paycheck, probably $50,000, $55,000 a year or less, the cumulative rate of price increases matters more than whether we're having a soft landing right now and heading toward 2%. For them, they've lost 20%, 25% purchasing power, and their wages have not kept up, and they're struggling to make ends meet. And we saw that play out to some extent in this election this week. They probably would not give the Fed as high a grade. So I would say being slow to raise rates and stop the bond buying, they get a low grade for that. But I think once they did the pivot in 180 to start raising rates and run down the balance sheet, I personally think they've done a good job. But they can't get away from that first period that I think is still causing struggles for a lot of the workforce. Understood. You just mentioned, of course, the big event in the last week, which has been the re-election of Donald Trump. You ran the Dallas Fed during his first term. So let me first ask what that was like to be a sitting Fed official with Trump at the helm of our government. So what you had to learn to do is be prepared to assess new fiscal policies, tax cuts, tariffs, and others, and try to incorporate them in your outlook. The one thing that does change, though, with administration and is political is supervision. And we had, I think, more constructive, benign supervision during 16 to 20. We had more stepped-up supervision after that. And so that was something we also had to adapt to. So just to clarify, your term actually spanned into the Biden administration, so you could tell the difference, and supervision was stricter or more stringent in Biden versus Trump? It actually, it spanned Obama, then Trump, then Biden. Yes, whereas our approach to rate-setting was very similar. The supervisory approach changed when the administration changed, and people should be aware of that. And that does affect part of your job as a Fed president. But you said you were able to essentially block out a lot of the noise. How convinced are you that's going to remain the case? There's some discussion that Trump will not reappoint Chair Powell and may try to influence the Fed to some extent. How do you view the prospect of Fed independence ahead? On the weight-setting process, I'm confident under Jay Powell's leadership, they will try to make decisions without regard to political influence or political pressure. They'll have to, though, adapt, which I know we'll talk about in a few minutes, new policies, understanding there'll be some structural shifts, and they'll have to adapt to that. And you'll see regulatory policy change again. And I think in between those two will probably be some discussion of the balance sheet and that the Fed has had very strong autonomy in how to use the balance sheet. I think there might be more debate about whether the Treasury should have more power on the balance sheet as well as the Fed, but I'd say that's a debate that's yet to come. Interesting. So, let's get into some of that. After the election result was known, we saw investors' expectations shift toward fewer weight cuts in 2025, and the presumption being that policies that will be implemented will on net be inflationary. So you've alluded to this even in our comments in the last few minutes. How does the Fed embed potential policy shifts in its expectations? What does that process look like? So I'll start with pre-election, my own view, and you've heard me say this, I felt even under the Biden administration, the continuation of the Harris administration if that had happened, I think there are two phases to rate cutting. And I think this is the mindset of the Fed before the election. Phase one is they can get the Fed funds rate down to four and a quarter to four and a half if inflation is running around two and a half. However, I think it was gonna be stickier than the markets may have expected to get below four and a quarter, four and a half, unless service sector inflation particularly moderated somewhat more. And the question was, with all these open-ended fiscal spending programs and with 7% of GDP deficits, would service sector inflation moderate? We know goods are disinflating, but services have been sticky. So that's pre-election. Post-election, you've got those questions still, but I think you're gonna see some changes. And here's how. The Fed is led by predominantly PhD economists. PhD economists, not exclusively, but heavily look at cyclical factors and they like to use models. When you have a new administration, you're gonna get structural changes, may not be amenable to a model. So let me give you the structural changes we're likely heading into, and I think this will get into the Fed's thinking. Heavy regulation currently versus the past in the U.S. economy, not just in the financial sector, but more broadly. We've had a excess supply of labor force growth, mainly due to immigration. That's gonna change most likely. In addition, you've got these directed government programs I talked about that are sizable, that are bidding directly on labor, Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure Act, CHIPS Act. And that labor they're bidding on tends to create jobs at $35, $37, $50 an hour for people that maybe before that were making $20 or $22 an hour. It's affecting service sector inflation. We're shifting now toward probably a regulatory review with intention of creating more productivity growth. These directed programs, I don't know, but it sounds like they may get stood down or repurposed. And it looks like the immigration growth that we actually benefited from, it's why we're growing at 3% this year, at best, it will get eliminated. And at worst, you might even see a reduction in the labor force due to some of these new immigration policies that are being discussed. Those are very significant structural changes. And you're also gonna see, by the way, one other in the energy transition, which is very significant, you're likely to see much more pressure from oil and gas production, lower prices at the pump, again, to attempt to help low-moderate-income families make ends meet. Those are some pretty substantial changes. Tariffs is the one other policy I haven't talked about. We live with tariffs now. You're likely to see tariffs increase. However, tariffs are only on goods. And there's always a consumer response to tariffs, i.e. you don't have to buy an imported product if it's too expensive. And so that will work itself out, but the Fed is gonna have to try to assess those tariffs and what those impacts are on inflation and unemployment. We're used to cyclical changes in the economy. It's been a while since we've had a range of structural changes. Now, COVID and post-COVID created a set of structural changes which we've been adapting to the last few years. We're now gonna go through a new transition where on some of these big issues about labor force growth, technology-enabled disruption, regulatory pendulum, globalization versus de-globalization, the energy transition, government debt spending, those are all big structural drivers and probably there's gonna be changes in every one of them. So that's a lot. So with the exception of the pressure on energy prices, downward pressure on energy prices, it sounds like these policies will largely lean towards more inflation, not less inflation. I don't think so. No, I think... I'd be careful. This is... You may have heard me say this is a puzzle that will have to fit together. And let me explain. The regulatory review is likely disinflationary. Higher productivity is likely disinflationary. As you talked about, lower energy prices is disinflationary. I'm not sure yet whether the tariffs, a one-time increase in tariffs, I don't know whether it's gonna be a negotiating tool to get more domestic consumption and production or how it will be used. And again, it's only on goods and consumers may adjust, may not be as inflationary as people think. The big question for me, to your point, is what happens with the labor force. And if you get a meaningful reduction in the labor force, that's gonna get stretched. I would guess labor costs may put more pressure on service sector costs. And that's why I think the jury's very much out. Do you see only criminals and people with known records deported? May not affect the labor force that much. Are you gonna see something much deeper? That's probably number one on the list of things I'm gonna be watching and I'd encourage people to watch. However, if you have tariffs and you encourage more domestic consumption and production, it could actually work if you have more labor. If you have less labor, it might actually put even more strain on the labor force. So this is a puzzle that we're gonna have to understand how it fits together and it's a little unclear at the moment. Interesting. A lot of moving parts. So you don't necessarily then share the market's view that the Fed will most likely cut rates less during a Trump administration than would have been the case under the Harris administration because we just don't know yet what these policies are gonna look like. My strong advice outside the Fed and if I were at the Fed is let's be risk managers, not prognosticators. Let's slow down. We're not gonna have good clarity on some of these policies maybe until spring of next year, I don't know. I think the Fed does well when it acts like a risk manager. When it starts prognosticating, what's an example of a prognostication? Transitory was a prognostication. It gets itself into trouble. And I think it's okay to admit that there are structural policies that are gonna affect the landscape. And what you may see the Fed do, and I might be an advocate for this, I'm not as certain. It's likely they'll cut in December, but I'm not certain yet. But I think you may see them take a little bit of a pause, depending on how the rest of the economy unfolds, to try to allow themselves time to understand this better. And I'd be careful not to be rigid or predetermined if I were at the Fed. And I think that's an important point you just made because I was just about to ask you about what this all means for December. And look, Chair Powell, I think himself said during the last press conference, he does not wanna speculate. So you think there's room for them to potentially pause? I think it's probably still more likely than not that they'll cut in December. But if I were in my former seat, I would wanna make it a game-time decision. I wanna see the November jobs report, which we're not gonna get until early December, because the hurricane and other weather events may have depressed the last jobs report. You may see a rebound. We'll get more clarity over the next month on what new policies might be. And if I were at the Fed, I'd wanna take every bit of the time allowed before I had to make a judgment about December, and I hope and expect you'll see them do that. So Rob, just to conclude, help us understand what this all could mean for markets. We've obviously seen a significant move across markets on the selection outcome in the equity market, in the bond market. What if anything should investors be paying more attention to that they're perhaps underappreciating at this point? So some of the folks around the new administration have used the term, we want to reprivatize the economy. I'm observing this. And I think what they mean is you may see less government-directed spending, you may see an effort to improve productivity through regulatory reform, and an effort to create more organic GDP growth that's spread throughout the economy. What could that mean? It could mean, interestingly, that top-line GDP growth might actually be lower. In other words, I don't know that we can keep growing at 3%. It might be closer to 2%, 2.5% than 3%. However, you might see corporate earnings benefit more. Certainly depending on what happens with the tax law, that'll be a factor also. And so the one thing I would say, if I were advising people what to watch first, second, and third, to me, the labor force and what's done with the labor force is probably right at the top of the list. Tariffs would come behind that, but if you simply stop the growth in immigration, that's one set of facts. If you actually reduce the size of the workforce, I think you're gonna need an adjustment through technology and technology-enabled disruption accelerated. What's an example? RoboTax, the driverless car. So I think people should be thinking about it as a puzzle. Don't get hung up too much on any one policy. It needs to fit together. But I think where there's a chance that you could see more organic growth, better earnings from corporates, obviously be positive for the markets. And I think some of the inflationary budget impacts are not yet clear to me, but they'll become clear as policies become clear. Rob, thanks so much for your time today. Thanks, Allison.

U.S. stocks, bond yields, and the U.S. dollar are all rising sharply in Wednesday trading. But will these moves have legs? And what medium- and longer-term market implications could this election outcome have? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I'm sitting down with Christian Mueller-Glissman, head of asset allocation research in Goldman Sachs Research, and Brian Garrett, who oversees equity execution on our cross-asset sales desk in Goldman Sachs Global Banking and Markets. Christian, Brian, welcome to the program. Thank you very much. Glad to be here. Yes. And, Brian, you've been up since the wee hours of the morning. Christian, you are in London, so you had the benefit of the time change, but we've all been up a lot overnight watching these markets, which, as I've just said, are reacting quite strongly to Donald Trump's victory. We've seen these so-called Trump trades that we've been talking about for a long time now really taking off. So, Brian, talk us through the flows that you are seeing today and how much further you think these trades can run, because they've already run quite a lot. I think coming into today, clients were underweight risk on where they wanted to be, especially in the event of the Trump potential red sweep. If we were to handicap it, clients were probably running at a 5 out of 10 in terms of positioning. We've seen clients engage on trades that worked following the 2016 election, which were long banks, long technology, long energy stocks. And if you look at 2016 as a playbook, the market rallied 2% the day after the election, and between mid-November and mid-December in 2016, we rallied another 3.5%, which, given where S&P is right now, would put us right around 6,100. But is the 2016 playbook the right playbook? Because it feels very different this time around. In 2016, Trump was a big surprise, but markets were largely expecting this result, if you look at prediction markets and the other gauges. So is that the right playbook? Because things have already been priced in to some extent. I think to some extent is the right way to frame it. We're seeing the 10-year interest rate up 20 basis points today, roughly. And so I agree that we're coming into 2024 at a different rate environment, and equities are obviously at a different multiple. But I think that the idea of continuation of tax cuts, the idea of more beneficial M&A environment, and the idea of less regulation on banks, a lot of these themes will work in 2024. Is there anything unexpected you've seen today about the price action? So I mean, definitely a surprise in the renewable energy space. You know, you've got some of these names that are down 15% to 20%, just on the fact that we could see changes to the IRA, which would have an impact on their earnings per share and their ability to generate revenue. One of the other things that I think was pretty surprising is the move in the VIX. The market had started to build in, you have election day, and then you maybe have two or three days of discovery where you don't know the outcome of the election. I don't think many people had it in their playbook that we would know the next president by 11 a.m. on Wednesday. And so you're seeing a very sharp repricing in market volatility. The two-day change in the VIX is one of the largest moves of the last decade. And so you're seeing that extra volatility come out of the marketplace very quickly. And Christian, listening to everything that Brian's saying right now, is that what you are generally observing from your seat across the pond? Yeah, I think as Brian was mentioning, the VIX decline was definitely faster than anticipated. Generally you see this pattern into the elections outcome. The VIX picks up a bit in the days after it comes down. This time it came down much faster. And the very interesting setup as a result of that is you started with a global risk on where actually European equities initially were up. And then throughout the day, they started to probably diverge. And that was definitely something interesting, which in our client conversation throughout the day, people did the analysis, focused on the potential impacts on growth and from tariffs on risks. And that started to take a bit longer for markets to realize. I think the other thing that's interesting is that the price behavior has been somewhat reflationary. You mentioned the 2016 episode as well. So you had equities up, bonds down. Normally in that type of backdrop, you would see global equities value a lot of those areas do better. But because of the additional dimension of tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, that didn't play out at all. And related to that, normally you would see commodities do better. So you would actually see oil and possibly even copper benefit from that type of price behavior. But this time around, because of the strong dollar, most likely, but also the linkages maybe to China, you have actually seen commodities broadly being down. So there are a few disconnects compared to the traditional reflation template. I want to spend one more minute on the decline in the VIX that both of you all just mentioned. We've seen a sharp decline. But if we think back to Trump's first administration, of course, a key feature of it was uncertainty. We never knew what was going to happen next. And if you think about the advisors and the cabinet that Trump is likely to have around him this time around, it seems like uncertainty is going to remain a big feature of this administration. But that's not being reflected in volatility. So why isn't that being more reflected by the markets? So I think the first thing is that the market remembers what the first year of the Trump presidency was. Post the 2016 election, every bank out there was saying that 2017 was going to be a year of volatility, similar to what you're talking about. But 2017 actually was one of the lowest realized vol calendar years in the last 60 years. What ends up happening is you have different agendas that go through, which creates a lot of dispersion at the index level where you can have banks and technology higher and you can have REITs and utilities lower. So you get a lot of under the surface movement where the index can stay relatively stable. Two other things that I would add to it. Number one, investors are under positioned. And so one thing that creates at least a bid to volatility is when people are looking to hedge. And I don't think anybody's looking to hedge right now. I actually think people are looking to add risk. And number two, there's a dynamic in the U.S. volatility market that creates a lot of pressure on the VIX and on implied option prices in the S&P. And so I think you're seeing a little bit of that get reflected in the market as well. And Christian, are we seeing those same patterns involve in other assets and in the more macro assets, not just equities? Yeah, I think it's definitely been the biggest move in equities. And there's been a huge amount of relief. I think equities did bake in uncertainty via skew, via vol. If you actually look at the put call ratio, it spiked into the election. So people were kind of seemingly hedging for the event. And to your question, it seems like we're still having a lot of uncertainty. Like the VIX is a one month type contract. So it's really the very shorter term uncertainty that the market is pricing here. So from that perspective, I think this kind of vol reset in equities is kind of making sense. It's kind of the core asset class and focus. What's interesting is rates volatility. I think we've seen some very large moves. Brian mentioned that in the back end yields, we've seen a steeping of the curve. Also if X volatility, we've seen some pretty large moves. In both cases into the event, volatility actually picked up the move index, which is the rates equivalent index of the VIX. That was actually quite elevated, was at a year to date high going into the elections and it's coming down, but it's coming down a bit slower. And you could argue that this kind of reflation that we're currently seeing, which to some extent for equities has been a positive story in a lot of regards. In rates markets, there's still a bit more lingering nervousness that you can see in the vol. The FX vol has also come down, but again, not as sharply as for the VIX, which reflects maybe risk on trade tariffs, details you might get. So I think FX and rates seemingly are seeing less of a clear reset in vol right now. But is your view that FX and rates vol will continue to move lower into year end? I think so. I think generally we're leaning towards rates volatility and having some potential to normalize their opportunities related to that. But I can understand to your point with the uncertainty on policy being high, with the appointments not being out yet, that the market will really struggle to kind of sell rates volatility, sell FX volatility, and especially in the areas that are directly exposed to US policy. So I could imagine it being quite sticky, but I would also argue that there's probably a carry opportunity over the next few months to lean a bit against the rates volatility being so high. We've seen this before. I think in the last two, three years, as we know, bonds have become a very difficult part of the portfolio to manage and rates volatility was unusually high. So there's a bit of a echo probably still going through people's minds and it might reflect positioning as well. We've seen people actually rotate into bonds quite a bit over the last few months. And so we've seen significant inflows into bonds in anticipation of rate cuts. So it feels like there's a lot of reasons why you might have more hedging demands, keeping vol a bit elevated. But Brian, on the equity side, you think volatility is setting up to remain low and the overall backdrop is risk on? Totally. I think one of the things that actually will create a pickup in volatility is a rally. Given the fact that clients are underexposed, what tends to happen, especially when you start to see increases in risk, like we're seeing today in the market, is you start to see clients start to chase call options. And so as the market rallies, you can actually get this spot up vol up dynamic that happens. And so, yeah, I think all else equal, a grinding type rally market will be vol suppressive. But I do think that if we start to see a pickup to the upside, we'll see a chase for options. Right. And investors are going to try to capture more of that upside through optionality. A hundred percent. But ultimately, if we hear what Christian just said, there is nervousness on the bond market side. Many of the economic policies that Trump intends to pursue, seems to want to pursue, are likely going to be inflationary. At least that's our economist's assessment and many economists' assessment. And so more concern about higher bond yields. Christian, any thoughts about, you know, concerns about what could dent the risk on and the enthusiasm in the equity market right now? Yeah, I think there is a risk of some reflation, frustration, some back and forth. And it comes down always, we say, to the level of bond yields. So from which level you're increasing the speed of the move and the source. And I think part of the reason why the market has taken the bond yield increases in its stride, especially small mid caps that have like floating rate debt, that are more levered And the max seven as well, I think, have performed reasonably well. Some people have often said that they are a bit more rate sets. And I think the reason why that happened is really the source. I think the source of the bond yield move is related to reflation, better growth, and better drivers of growth, deregulation, taxes. So from that perspective, right now, the market looks at the growth inflation policy mix and actually sees the overall mix as favorable. I think there's two things how this can become a bit more problematic. The first one is speed. So what we found is if over a three month horizon, the US 10-year yield goes up by more than two standard deviations from its trough, that usually drives some indigestion. So we got to be a bit careful about that. And the other thing to consider is the level. And you want to think about in particular the level of real yields. We've done some new work that actually shows that if the real yield goes up too much relative to the long run trend growth expectations that people have in their minds, that eventually can then also weigh on equities. And that is very closely linked to Fed policy. And so we also have a Fed meeting as if we needed another major event this week. Goldman Sachs Research is expecting the Fed to cut by 25 basis points tomorrow. But Christian, will any of this influence the Fed path ahead? I think our economists have not really changed their forecast at this juncture in a big way I think markets have been backpedaling on the Fed cuts for some time now. That really has kind of happened as the odds for Trump have picked up before. Because we have to be completely clear while this reflationary shift today has been extreme and large. I think it's been going on for a few weeks, and then you had a bit of a setback. So I think the market has been backpedaling a bit on how much the Fed cuts, not because of the elections, but because of the growth. I think the U.S. growth picture has generally been better than expected, and macro surprises have turned positive. And that can already explain some of the Fed cuts having been taken out. So I think that process is emulsion with the kind of recent, you could say reflation acceleration, if you like. And I think to some extent, it's somewhat in line with what we're discussing here. You have some inflationary policies, you have some potential impacts on growth via deregulation via taxes. But I think the reason why our economists have not been making those changes in part is because there are some offsetting factors. There can be negative impacts on growth from the tariffs as well, in particular, outside of the U.S., of course, but it can create feedback loops via financial conditions. You could argue about all kinds of kind of interaction effects with the market. Like right now, for example, financial conditions are easing. So that could also make the Fed want to be a bit less dovish. And so I think to some extent, that makes it incredibly difficult. That direction of travel, though, seems to be less Fed cuts. And I think the market has already reflected quite a bit of that. Right. Brian, do you agree with that? Yeah, I think 25 basis points for tomorrow is pretty much a done deal. You know, and market expectations are now that about a half a cut has been taken out of the futures pricing for next year, just as of this morning. So to Christian's point, like you are starting to see the reflation theme play out in kind of longer term Fed expectations. Right. But let's be clear, the market expectations for the Fed path has been extremely volatile over the last, let's call it year. Correct. So we'll see what the future brings. Christian, let's take a little bit of a longer term look. When you think as an investor about your portfolio right now, does anything that happened over the course of the last 24 hours with this election outcome that is looking like a Republican sweep, although not confirmed at the time of this recording, but does any of that impact the way that investors should be thinking about asset allocation in their portfolios? Yeah, I think generally our allocation has been shifting in a more late cycle direction. It always sounds quite scary when you hear late cycle. But what we've been arguing is that we're in a very stable, early late cycle backdrop. So we don't expect a recession at all, but there's certain elements of the economy. And you mentioned that that's different to 2016, certain elements of the economy appear late cycle. So unemployment rates are very low, profit margins are high, output gaps are positive. If you look at the equity risk premium, it's very low, credit spreads are tight. So I think from that perspective, you want to put your late cycle kind of asset allocation together. Generally what we say is if you're not expecting a recession late cycle, the right allocation is overweight equity, underweight credit, neutral duration. And the idea is that credit is often in a late cycle backdrop, more constrained in terms of the type of returns it can deliver because spreads are tight and you get paid to spread. And maybe you even suffer a bit on your duration part of the fixed income portfolio. So we generally like to be underweight credit. And there's also more negative convexity in case something goes wrong and you do actually get a recession and credit can be quite illiquid and react very fast. Whereas if you look at equities in a late cycle backdrop, there is much more optionality. You have optionality that the cycle re-accelerates and that's exactly I think what the market is betting on right now that you get via tax cuts, via deregulation, certain laggards of the economy start to drive equity returns, you get a broadening out of equity returns. And I think you also can see valuations expand. I think that's the very interesting thing about late cycle periods. Often you have equities overturned on valuations. You might argue we've already seen a bit of that and that's fair. I think equities have actually been driven by valuations quite a bit in the last 18 months because of the very favorable macro and to some extent the optimism around the max seven. But that doesn't mean that it cannot go further, especially if there's optimism. So I think like generally we want to protect such an equity overweight as long as possible. And this will be the next stage. So unless there's a significant shift with regards to growth, it will be about kind of hedging and protecting that equity overweight. And that will be the challenge in the next six to 12 months because there will be setbacks. There will be setbacks like we discussed, like reflation frustration. There will be setbacks with regards to geopolitical events, policy uncertainty. And I think in this type of late cycle backdrop, we want to protect the equity overweight as long as possible until you actually really have a reason to worry, which is mainly a recession. And given some of the comments you made earlier about the different reactions across different equity markets around the world, when you say equity overweight, do you mean overweight U.S. equities or how do you feel about diversification internationally in the equity market at this point? I think normally, as I mentioned, the reflation template in a late cycle acceleration would be going a bit in the direction of laggards and outside of the U.S. is where a lot of laggards are. But we have to be careful because the policy uncertainty is unusually high with regards to the rest of the world. So our current asset allocation, we're overweight U.S. equities and we're overweight Asia. The reason why we've been overweight Asia and this is the allocation we had before the election outcome is to some extent to diversify because it wasn't 100% clear that we would get such a Republican sweep type outcome as it looks right now. So we wanted to diversify, but also we have to consider that Asia is not only very depressed from a valuation and positioning point of view, but there's also the fiscal stimulus that our team has seen quite favorable. So from that perspective, you have this overweight in U.S. and Asia. And at the margin, of course, with the outcome now out, you have headwinds for Asia, no doubt. And I think we've been neutral on Japan. Japan turned out to be a very good diversifier for this event because of the strength of the dollar. I think Japanese equities actually performed very well. But I think I would say that Asia, both Asia X Japan and Japan, I think that sounds like more of a neutral. I think the more interesting area is, of course, Europe. And I think seemingly both in terms of price action, but also in terms of first takes from our economists, Europe could be quite badly impacted. And so we're underweight Europe on the equity side. We also underweight Europe on the credit side in Europe in high yield. We're overweight U.S., underweight Europe in high yield. And we overweight duration in Europe, which is, again, a bearish view where we do think that trade tariffs could hurt growth. But even without the kind of setup that we're facing potential, Europe was already doing quite coolly economically. So I think we're currently quite underweight Europe. So you have to be selective in terms of diversification and broadening out. Thanks, Christian. Lots of food for thought. Brian, any last words on what you're watching from here? Yeah, sure. I think that Christian makes a great point in terms of looking for laggards globally. I would also be looking for laggards domestically, under-owned sectors within the U.S. equity market that have not quite kept up with the mag seven. I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity for a rally there. And then I also think that, as Christian mentioned, late cycle, you should be overweight equities. My expectation is that the cost to hedge a portfolio will continue to decrease throughout the rest of this year and potentially in the next year. And so if you are going to be going out on the risk spectrum, you know, the cost to protect that equity exposure is likely to come in and could be very attractive in the next couple months. Christian, Brian, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Wednesday, November 6th, 2024.

Feliciano is finding value across private markets\n**Episode ID:** 4532\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWelcome to Goldman Sachs Exchanges. You might notice that today's episode is coming to you on Monday rather than our regular Tuesday. That's because after the US election, we're going to give you a special episode looking at the market reaction to whatever the news may be. Today you'll hear a great interview with Jose Feliciano, co-founder and managing partner of investment firm Clear Lake Capital, conducted by my Goldman Sachs colleague, Michael Brandmeier. We hope you enjoy. Welcome back to Goldman Sachs Exchanges Great Investors. I'm Michael Brandmeier, global head and chief investment officer of the External Investing Group within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Today I'm very excited to be sitting down with Jose Feliciano, managing partner of Clear Lake Capital Group. Jose co-founded Clear Lake in 2006 and has helped grow it into one of the world's largest private equity firms with $80 billion in assets under management today. How has Jose been able to drive such incredible growth and what does the future look like for Clear Lake Capital and for the private equity industry in general? We're going to talk to Jose about his career, his investment philosophy, and his unique outlook on the investment opportunities today. I'm very pleased to welcome Jose Feliciano. Jose, welcome, or should I say welcome back to Goldman Sachs since you started your career here. Let's get right into it. It's a very interesting time in markets and in the world right now. And we're currently having this debate of what direction is the economy going. Clear Lake must be very excited about the forward opportunity set. You talk about how you like to invest across economic cycles, across the capital structure. How are you seeing the world right now? First of all, thank you. Thank you for having me back. Very exciting to be back at Goldman Sachs. This is definitely one of those times in the world where the outlook appears to be extremely uncertain, even to investors, even to private equity firms like us. When you look at the crystal ball, you see many contradicting factors out there. You certainly see at the very macro geopolitical, you see lots of issues. We have a war in Europe. We have a significant conflict in the Middle East. We have significant tension in Asia. Here in the U.S., we have an election. So these are all very significant factors that could push the economy one way or the other. As you mentioned, for us, the most important thing is not necessarily predicting where the economy is going to be, but it's understanding where the opportunities might be across a broad array of industries or our focus industries, and then trying to understand what is the best way to invest in those industries. But personally, I think that we're most likely going to finally see decreasing interest rates, despite probably an uneven backdrop in terms of the macro. But we're going to see probably, generally speaking, a resumption of growth. It's probably not going to be the same type of growth that we saw pre the latest slowdown. And we're probably going to see a lot more volatility in both the stock market and certainly in other significant macro factors. At the end of the day, though, our job is not to predict the macro. I think our job is to find great companies and great management teams that we can partner with. And we plan to do that. So a lot of your brethren out there are complaining, saying, gosh, the markets aren't really open. It's hard to get a lot done. If you just look at the industry data, transaction flows are still quite light overall, but you have a very different toolkit at Clearlake that you can access things through different parts of the capital structure. So how do you think the opportunity set as you sit here today looks different? Yeah, that's a great question. I'll give you an example. I'll go back to 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic and essentially almost overnight in the course of two or three weeks, right, the capital markets essentially shut down. We saw extreme volatility in the capital markets overall and obviously a real effect on the real economy. Those are moments in time where the traditional private equity firms are not able to access the market. There's not much to do when the capital markets shut down. During that summer and kind of beginning of the fall, Clearlake invested probably three or four billion dollars in that time period. Obviously that was a very interesting time because we saw a significant repricing of risk, meaning that in the secondary markets, primarily debt, prices were much cheaper. Everything went down very significantly. And that's one of the hallmarks of Clearlake, as you're alluding to, the ability to invest across economic and credit cycles with different entry points, as we call them. And I think going back then to this moment in time, I think we see similar opportunities. We do see a reopening of the capital markets. Obviously interest rates are going to be higher for longer probably, but we do think that there's going to be very selective opportunities in the buyout side. There's going to be really interesting opportunities in what we call special situations, things like carve-outs, turnarounds. And we do see idiosyncratic distress or special situations where there are really interesting opportunities to buy companies or accessing those companies through debt or restructurings. Jose, investors have been hurting for more liquidity. In private equity parlance, we call this DPI. So this is cash coming back to investors who have invested in private equity firms. If I look at how much money in the last few years you've returned LPs, it's a lot. And you've continued to be quite creative in getting money back to LPs. Talk about your thinking and your strategy there. Yeah, that's a great question. And over the past two, three years, we have returned upwards of $15 billion of capital to our LPs. We have always believed that our job at the core is very simple. We take our investors' money, a lot of our own money as well, and we invest it. And the quicker we can get it back to our investors with the higher multiple attached to it, meaning multiply that capital, the better it is. And I think one of the significant things as part of our ethos is that we're always looking for that exit opportunity. We're looking for two or three things. When we basically invest in a company, we're looking to make that company bigger, better. We certainly have a lot of pride in that over time we have done that consistently. And a lot of that has to do with our operational framework, which we call OPS, operations, people, strategy. And we can talk more about that. But at the core, every single quarter, we're thinking of our portfolio and thinking about what are the companies that are mature enough, where the value creation has already occurred and where there might be interesting exit opportunities. And we have accessed those from time to time. We have been creative about how to do that. We have done everything from selling companies, obviously, to strategics, to other sponsors, public or IPOs and other public opportunities. And we have certainly used continuation funds and other interesting vehicles, again, to make sure that our investors have access to that capital and have the benefit of that value creation that we think we can create. Right. So you invest mostly in tech, in industrials. So let's talk about the flavor of opportunities in both those spaces. Tech was certainly overfunded over a period of time. There are a thousand private unicorns. That means a company that was founded in private markets at a valuation of more than a billion dollars. There's a thousand of those. If you look at the typical IPO pipeline or annual IPOs that are done, that's probably a 15-year supply. So that's not going to happen. In other words, you also have many tech buyouts that were down over the last few years at very high valuations. So there's a real lack of liquidity. There's a lot of companies that are upside down. Then you have AI that is ripping through the investing world. And we'll get into this for industrials as well. But talk about how you think this opportunity sets up for Clearlake. Yeah. First, we're still in the middle of the ballgame in terms of the impact of technology on our economy and the opportunity to invest in that transition. Right. We think that technology has an important role in our economy, our society, and hopefully a positive role in terms of creating all kinds of efficiencies. What has changed is, I think, some of the statistics that you mentioned. There's a very significant amount of very interesting companies, many of them private, that are looking for either more capital or other types of exit opportunities as well, evaluating strategic alternatives. Some of those are going to be foreclosed in the near future. And we think that's a very interesting opportunity for Clearlake because from the very beginning of the firm, we have invested in those companies and technology. And we have, we think, one of the broadest toolkits in the industry in terms of how to invest in technology, meaning that we understand how to invest in a company, perhaps, that is growing very fast and where the playbook might be continuing that growth and maybe supplementing that growth with strategic M&A. But we also understand how to take companies through transitions. Companies, for example, are selling licenses, on-prem software that are now transitioning to software as a service. We have plenty of experience taking companies to that transition, creating a lot of value doing that. We have plenty of experience helping companies transition from what used to be a much higher growth kind of model to a somewhat slower growth model. And we have certainly a lot of experience taking then those companies that now maybe are experiencing a slower growth and revamping operations and helping them find the places where the company can grow again and reignite or resume that more rapid growth. And that is, we think, the essence of value creation. So for us, technology will continue to be probably our largest sector. And we'll continue to look for opportunities primarily in software, primarily in subsectors that we understand very well and we think are ripe for that type of transformation. For example, healthcare IT is probably our largest sector within software and one that we think will continue to provide very interesting opportunities. So we think that the investing opportunity in tech is here. It's real. And certainly, if we had a more significant downturn, if we had a more significant slow down where there were more of those companies that require not only capital, but expertise to turn those companies around or to help them get back to a healthier profile, we have that expertise as well. So we are actually quite bullish about the opportunities set in the next 18, 24 months, particularly in technology. Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, AI, there's going to be two categories. There's going to be companies that take advantage of it and disrupt. Then, of course, there's going to be the disrupted. And I think that's going to happen in sectors like technology as well as industrials. In other sectors, probably very few sectors will be untouched. Maybe deeply regulated businesses will have more of a moat around them. But AI is coming everywhere. How do you use the OPS playbook to make sure within your technology companies that you're a disruptor, not a disruptee? Absolutely. First of all, let me try to demystify what we call OPS. So OPS is our version of an operational framework that we use to make our companies, to be very simple, bigger and better. So the idea is that we'll focus on certain aspects of those companies, either the operations, the people, the strategy, sometimes more, sometimes multiple aspects of the business. And we're trying to really identify what really matters at the beginning of the investment, trying to make that better. And we have found that through a lot of focus and blocking and tackling and hopefully strong execution, we have been successful in doing that. And that typically translates into what you're looking for in investments, a more rapid or faster revenue growth and hopefully better margins. And most, most importantly, and the most difficult to measure is a more valuable company that's more significant, more interesting within its ecosystem. So hopefully when you go to sell, not only do you get a better multiple, but you probably have a broader set of potential buyers because it's such an interesting asset. And that's kind of what we try to do in most of our companies and most of our businesses. Within that context, the advent of AI is fascinating, right? Obviously the concept of machine learning has been around for a really long time, but technology does reach certain inflection points and it does seem like we have reached that inflection point with AI where now it's more scalable and certainly it's ripe for applications in companies of significant scale, which is obviously highly applicable to our companies and more broadly to private equity. I think there are many ways where AI could be applied and could make a very significant impact on our business. It starts at home, right? You know, we're using AI at Clearlake for all kinds of complex and simple things. We're looking to AI to help us source, we're looking at AI to help us synthesize information and present that actually faster and in better formats to our investors and to ourselves. But I think most importantly, and what you're getting at is the impact of AI in the broader economy and hence portfolio companies. And we think that there are two aspects of it for our companies. Obviously AI can bring significant efficiencies across many companies and industries. The typical example will be, you know, customer service is going to be increasingly more and more automated and driven by AI and powered by AI. And that's kind of a simple application that applies to our tech companies, our industrial companies, even consumer-driven companies who benefit and be impacted by that. But I actually think that there's even a more interesting opportunity set. You know, like when we talk about AI and machine learning, we can never forget what powers that machine, right? The machine has to learn from datasets. And one of the really interesting things that we have been focusing on is both our tech companies, our industrial companies oftentimes generate massive datasets, and those datasets are very specialized and they're proprietary. And those are extremely valuable and will become more and more valuable as we think of interesting applications within AI. And you have these proprietary datasets that are going to be the linchpin for the machine to be able to provide those efficiencies. You know, the best example is probably within healthcare IT, where there's significant applications where big datasets are generated, you know, significant amounts of data. Then that dataset is extremely important for that machine to learn and potentially make them or potentially translate to better outcomes, better predictability of outcomes, better forecasting, and hopefully in the case of healthcare, you know, better treatment and better outcomes for patients. So we think that AI ultimately will be a force for good. And we're certainly thinking about many creative ways of incorporating that into our investing framework. I think a lot of people talk about AI in the context of tech. And obviously there's already many examples within your portfolio that demonstrate how effectively you're using AI. When you think about diligencing industrial assets, one of the advantages I think ClearLake has is the fact that it's multi-sector and has deep expertise in both of these spaces. When you're looking at industrial assets today, how's it changed your due diligence process? And do you think it's just table stakes that everyone's looking at an asset the same way and thinking about, okay, here's how this business could be transformed using AI? Or are you seeing situations where you have a unique angle because of your skill sets, your industry expertise, and your ability to go in with OPS and make fundamental change to companies? Yep. We have reached that inflection point that I was referencing before, where I think every board of every significant company in the U.S. and globally should have a board meeting dedicated to AI and how AI can potentially transform your business and what are the threads obviously implied by AI, you know, both competitively, but also from a business model perspective. So I think we have reached that moment. I would encourage everybody to do that, you know, in their portfolios or, you know, if you own a company or you're a board member of a company, I think it's the time to do that. It's now or maybe yesterday. It is really interesting, you know, when you think more broadly about, you know, how technology can be applied in the industrial investing. Every company right now is a technology company in a way. You know, if you look at any industrial company and their manufacturing processes, they're, you know, oftentimes very significantly automated and certainly heavily reliant on technology. So I think every company is a technology company nowadays. We, for example, invested in one of the largest providers in the self-storage industry of building product systems, you know, building systems, not necessarily the place that you would think about, you know, as very technology focused. But what we quickly determined is that not only did the company have a great product, a brick and mortar product that, you know, they had sold and had garnered very significant market share in that market, but that industry knowledge could translate to selling other products right into the same channel. And we innovated. We actually, as part of that platform, made several add-on acquisitions. All of them, or most of them actually on the technology side, where we focus on the entry systems. You know, when you think about the self-storage industry, inherently you have a consumer relationship where somebody actually gets a self-storage unit and then you need a lock, you know, and those locks tend to be the old fashioned lock, a key or a code. We invested in electronic entry systems that you could very simply use with your app and your phone, et cetera. But from a business model perspective, if you think about it, we took what was a old fashion manufacturing company and started to introduce a business model that now implied a sale that not only was a one-time sale, but implied now a ongoing relationship with the customer, creating a lot of data. Now the owner of that self-storage facility understands, you know, who's using the facility, when, who's opening those doors and when. As a consumer, you understand if your lock is open or not, you can actually provide a temporary code. But again, most importantly, now you're paying basically not only the one-time upfront, but you have a recurring revenue associated with the maintenance of that kind of system. You have recurring revenue associated with other aspects of the refurbishment. And then for the ultimate customer, which is the self-storage facility owner, you have a massive increase in ROI, you know, because actually we were able to demonstrate that using these electronic locks, you could charge more rent and you had a happier customer and people will stay with you longer. Massive transformation from a revenue model and business model perspective in a company that, you know, if you look at it at first blush was essentially just manufacturing, you know, kind of a building product going to a specialized niche in industry or subsector. Yeah. I love to talk about examples like this when I'm talking to a general audience and I get this question, you know, isn't private equity just levered public equity? And at Goldman Sachs, we really like partnering with managers that have that combination of industry expertise and operating expertise. And it's such a great example because here's a situation where you go and you have a totally different view on what can be done with an asset. And you put yourself in a situation where you're playing chess when everyone else is playing checkers. That's absolutely right. And so we see you do that again and again, and it's the power of private equity right there. Jose, I remember when you were raising your first institutional fund and you and your co-founder, big dog Bali had a very strong view on what you wanted to do. And right back in those very first meetings, you had a perspective that you wanted to have a lot of flexibility in your investment mandate. You wanted to be able to invest across cycles and across the capital structure. And that went right back to the very beginning of Clearlake. And we remember in those first discussions with you thinking, here are these relatively young guys. They have such a clear perspective, but you were unyielding in your conviction that was the right way to go about it. So talk about your formative experiences and what brought you at the founding of Clearlake going back, what, 17 years ago. Now you're Wiley veterans. Now you're very good at it. But at the time you were setting up a new private equity firm with a clear point of view as to how you were going to approach the markets differently. Yes, we were starting private equity firms. But even beyond that, right, you know, we were entrepreneurs and I always tell people that are thinking about starting their own firm, that great entrepreneurs have an idea that they believe is transformational. They believe that they understand how to do something that other people are doing, but they think they can do it differently. And we certainly had that idea. We felt that there was a better way to invest. This idea of combining sector expertise with the ability to invest across economic and credit cycles. And that combined with making these companies bigger, better operationally. And that combination, if you think about it, you know, almost 20 years ago did not exist or was not prevalent, at least in private equity. So we did have that belief. And as an entrepreneur, then there were things that we were willing to sacrifice that were negotiable. So for example, the economics of that fund in the early days when we were unknown, an unknown firm, and it was a difficult time, we started fundraising essentially in the middle of the great financial crisis. We sacrifice, we sacrifice ownership of the firm. We sacrifice economics. But what we were unyielding to your point was in what we believe was actually at the core of the investing strategy. We had never compromised what we think is important, which is the core strategy that we used to invest, that core investment approach, because we always felt that was a better way of generating great returns and outperforming. As a result of that, even though we were young and it was our formative years, we resisted any type of pressure, any type of influence, any type of ideas about changing that investment strategy or limiting that investment strategy. That was anathema to us. So we actually, at a time where we needed the capital and we were looking around for capital in a very difficult market, we actually refused investors that were trying to limit us because we felt that was going to hamper the very core of what we were trying to do. And we were resolute. So I think as an entrepreneur, and certainly as a private equity investor or investor in general, you have to understand what are those non-negotiables, right? You know, what is at the core of that investment strategy? What makes you special? What is that secret sauce? And I think you have to be uncompromising on that. And we certainly have been. And so what were the formative experiences before that? Because that was a conviction where you were willing to make real trade-offs, real and important economic trade-offs to get what you wanted, to have the investment style that you thought was going to be differentiated. You've obviously had time at Goldman Sachs. You worked at a tech company during the dot-com period. You worked at another private equity firm. So when we look at you and Bedard and the formative experiences, because you showed up with a lot of conviction, what were the experiences that gave you that conviction? I think by the time we started the firm, even though we were young, I started my career at Goldman Sachs in 1994. So we had over a decade of experience in the financial markets already. And we certainly, from different vantage points, saw different types of investors navigate actually significant dislocation. And in the past 30 plus years, we have had a few significant dislocations. Obviously we had the pandemic, we had the great financial recession. But before that, obviously we had the dot-com era and the dot-com crash. My prior firm, which was more focused on special situations, navigated that a certain way. But that came from a more traditional private equity model at that time. They navigated that environment differently. And from that emanated a few key ideas. One, the world was changing. There were going to be certain industries that were going to be more significant drivers of growth within the general economy. Technology, for example, being probably the most obvious and significant example. We wanted to be industry-focused or sector-focused as opposed to just generalist. We felt that sector-focused investors ultimately were going to have an edge and were going to understand how to create value in those industries differently. And we're going to be able to understand the opportunities within that industry faster. That's particularly important in times of crisis where you have to make decisions much more quickly. And you can also bring the right resources much more quickly. You understand the ecosystem. You have a relationship with the right management teams and the right people and the right consultants, et cetera, et cetera. So we just felt that being embedded in that sector ecosystem was going to make us better investors and more effective long-term. That was number one. Number two was this idea that the great investors out there, people like Warren Buffett, one of the things that has distinguished great investors is that they don't have narrow, very prescribed ways of investing. They actually have very broad mandates, and they have the ability to think about how to invest in the best place at the right time. And that evolved into this idea that we wanted to have the flexibility in one fund, which again, almost 20 years ago, it was actually somewhat unique to in the same fund, be able to do a traditional buyout, more complicated deals like turnarounds, carve-outs, structure equity, all the way to potentially distress or investing in the secondary market. And then as we were growing up and seeing how companies and investors behave in the aftermath of the dot-com crash and the opportunity set there, we also felt that being a financial investor only, being a financial engineer was not enough. Yeah, it was great to buy a company at a good price, maybe add some leverage to your point and create returns that way, but you needed to be a better investor than most. And to do that, you needed to basically create value, you needed to make these companies bigger and better. And over time, over the past 17 years, that is what has culminated into this idea of OPS. But I think those formative years were crucial, right? Seeing from different vantage points, how different firms navigated what turned out to be very volatile times in terms of investing, that was actually a great opportunity to generate new ideas about, is there a better way to invest? Is there a better model? And ultimately though, we realized that we still had to conform in certain ways to what private equity was, right? So we didn't want to completely reinvent how to structure a private equity fund. So our fund, our fees, the way we think about it and talk to investors, that's very conventional, very traditional. But how we invest, as it turns out, was very different, particularly again, 17 years ago when we started the firm. Jose, you mentioned Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett had Charlie Munger and they were partners for decades. It was part of their success. You also have a very successful partnership. You co-founded Clearly Capital with Big Dog Ibali. One of the things that we've always liked about Clearlake is the ethos of the firm, the values that you guys have. You're both immigrants. You're from Puerto Rico. He's from Iran. You bring very complementary skill sets. And like you've talked about a lot, you really have some very hard skills and capabilities that are differentiated. A lot of times it's the intangibles that make the difference. Talk about the partnership you have and how you think that makes you different. By now, I partnered with Bidad 17 plus years ago and it's been an incredible partnership, an incredible run. I think like any team, part of that emanates from understanding our strengths. And we certainly have different strengths and weaknesses. Understanding our commonalities. I think you mentioned one of them, right? We came with lots of commonalities in terms of our families, even though we came from very different places in the world. Families that were not wealthy monetarily, but were wealthy in other ways, in terms of education and love and nurturing, as it turns out of us. And also a high degree of focus on education, the power of education as a catalyst for a better world, for us and for others. And I think that still translates and it's an important part certainly of my life. At the same time, we also were able to harness our differences. We have different personalities and different perspectives and different ways of looking at a problem. You know, I'm an engineer by training. I tend to be more analytical, framework driven, but I may think about things sometimes a different way. But that combination, appreciating kind of those commonalities, those differences, and over time, learning then how to agree and disagree. That's one of the most important things about a great partnership. And I think we put that all together in the context of also having a very common vision about the firm and the culture of the firm. And one of the things that in this industry, we don't talk enough about, I think, is how culture can affect how you invest and how different firms behave. And I think that's actually fundamental. And from the very beginning, we wanted to create a culture that was based on teamwork, on humility, on that constant improvement, on always thinking about our investors, much like Goldman Sachs has the 14 principles. And, you know, you think about your clients coming first. Actually, from time to time, you know, use some Goldman Sachs IP and bring up the 14 principles to my team and mention that or use that as an example, right? You know, how very simple but clear principles can build a great firm. And that's what we're trying to do ultimately. Yeah. One of the things that I think is consistent about you, you talk about your format is conventional, but I'm guessing that neither of you when you're in the sixth grade thought you were going to be private equity titans, right? From very different backgrounds. And so I found that you've always been able to challenge conventional wisdom and not constrain yourself in a way that many people, frankly, do constrain themselves because they grew up in an industry and they're expected to act a certain way. And that's paid off for investors because I think you've made money because you have so much flexibility. Personality wise, where do you think that comes from? I think for me, so my dad was an engineer and I grew up building Lego sets and thinking about how things work. My dad also did a lot of woodworking. So I was always fascinated by how things are built and how things work. And ultimately, I was good at math and science and all those type of things. And that translated into an education as a mechanical and aerospace engineer, even though I ended up going to Goldman Sachs. So I joke around that, you know, I went from differential equations and calculus. And then as a banker, you basically add, subtract. Sometimes you multiply. It's mostly... Is there a great math? But I think what it did for me, though, it cemented that idea that when you're presented with a problem, with an idea, with a company, with a process, with a product, you want to ask why, why do people do it this way? Is there a better way of doing it? But oftentimes you actually find out that there's a better way of doing it and nobody wanted to challenge it. Nobody thought about it, or it was so ingrained in the people in that industry or that group to do it a certain way that nobody wanted to challenge that conventional wisdom. So I love conventional wisdom because as the name implies, it has some wisdom embedded in it. But I also think that you should always try to look outside the box and see if there's a better way of doing it. And we do that all the time at Clearlake, right? You know, that's kind of part of our ethos, right? You know, when we make a great investment, yeah, we look back and try to decipher why it became a great investment. But oftentimes when we make a bad investment or we make a mistake, you know, with that, we try to really understand why we did it that way. But ultimately it is with the view or the objective of analyzing and understanding who we are, what we're doing, how we're doing it, and how we can get better at it. And challenging our own conventional wisdom as a result. Maybe one of the best examples of this is your recent purchase of Chelsea Football Club, where I think the whole world was scratching their heads saying Clearlake is coming in and buying one of the most storied European football clubs. And we've talked about this and you said, look, Mike, it's not that much different than a software company. So talk about your perspective on that asset and why you thought it was interesting. Yeah. So first and foremost, you know, I think when you think about sports, you're thinking about much more than just a business, right? You know, kind of sports connotes and denotes emotion and passion. And certainly we're very familiar with that. I became a soccer football fan probably in 1998, you know, so over 25 years ago, I'm very passionate about it. So I think number one, you have to understand the ethos of the sport. You have to understand that this for many people is much more than just a game. It's much more than just a business. At the same time, you know, when you translate to make that club sustainable, you have to look at the business aspects of it. And as you then correctly point out, sports over the past 20, 30 years has as a business be completely transformed in terms of a business model, right? You know, where the focus used to be much more on, you know, maybe the stadium itself and the attendance and selling hot dogs and beers. If you're here in the U.S. to how do you basically take that franchise, that club and what happens on the field or on the pitch and how can you basically bring that to the most people possible to the fans, to the supporters, to the people that are at the core of that club. And in today's world, a lot of that is technology, right? You know, obviously you see the advent of not only the traditional media networks, but in today's world, a lot of people are consuming or looking at or seeing or watching their favorite club through all kinds of different channels, right? You know, you're probably doing it on your phone and you're maybe watching small clips of your favorite player on TikTok or things like that. So we identify that, you know, sports again, much more than just a business is a passion is a movement. And there were incredible opportunities that came from understanding how to basically provide that to the broadest number of people. And that means that then when you look at the most teams and most major leagues across the world, most of the revenue has transformed then into multi-year contractual revenue that comes from media companies or comes from multi-year sponsorship deals or things like that. And at the core, we have learned a lot, you know, over the past two years as investors and controlling investors in Chelsea and understanding how to put first the club and the team and that ethos and our fans and supporters at the same time, how to in that context, build a sustainable business that can continue to provide that same enjoyment, that same passion, that same feeling to our fans and supporters. Amazing. I want to pivot for a moment to the personal side, because you are very active. You're very civic minded. You're very philanthropic. And maybe you could just spend a moment talking about some of your work on the philanthropy side with your wife, Kwanzaa Jones. I know you founded the Supercharged Initiative. So tell us about your passions outside of the office and off the field. So particularly my mom, you know, really instilled in me this idea of giving back. Even when we didn't have a whole lot, you know, we were always, and she was always, you know, writing checks to UNICEF and trying to be charitable and trying to really make an impact on others that maybe were not as fortunate. So I think that has always been part of my DNA, if you will. And certainly not a day goes by that I don't think about, you know, how fortunate, you know, personally and as a family we have been. And I think there's a responsibility that comes with that. Then the responsibility is to try to basically leave something behind that's a little bit better than how you found it and try to give back and try to maybe even, if you're really successful, provide others, you know, with the same path or at least the same idea, the same tools about how to get there. So I think we identified a few principles that we think are important in terms of that success. And those principles revolve around very simple things, you know, education, entrepreneurship, empowerment, equity. And we try to basically give back or really invest is the term that I love to use more because even though we may not get a financial return, we may get a social impact return. We may get a psychic income return out of helping others. And we have tried to basically direct our efforts that way. And I think that's as important as anything else that I do nowadays. So for us, it has translated into significant investments or contributions, donations to educational institutions, our alma mater, Princeton University, Stanford, other, you know, much smaller local communities, you know, during the pandemic, right? Then, for example, the issue of the digital divide was basically stark looking at it in our face. So we invested with donated significant amounts to nonprofits that were trying to deal with that, you know, by providing high speed Wi-Fi and Internet access, you know, computers, things like that. And it's not only in non-for-profits, you can make a lot of impact on the profit world. You know, it's well known in the industry, there's all kinds of statistics, but roughly one or 2% of the capital out there goes to either women or, you know, funds managed by women or underrepresented minorities. So we have invested over now upwards of $200 million in funds managed by women and underrepresented minorities, but that's not charity, right? You know, I'm investing in people that I think are going to generate better than average, actually top quartile, hopefully top decile returns. And I think for me, it's almost, you know, to use hedge fund parlance, it's an arbitrage, right? You know, it's basically underused talent. I mostly care about, you know, am I investing in the best talent out there? And if that talent happens to be female or happens to be black or brown, that's okay. Actually, that's great. And if other people have underestimated that talent, it's even better because, you know, we can invest more and we can create or generate or get even better returns. But ultimately, I would love those people to be able to scale their firms, to be able to be discovered by others. And ultimately, my hope is that there'll be a lot more Clear Lake Capitals, more Vista equities, more firms like that, that are utilizing 100% of the human capital of this incredible country. Jose, we like to end these podcasts with a lightning round where we run you through a few quick questions. Let's go. What is your greatest strength as an investor? I can think about and understand my mistakes, but not dwell on them. And the next day I can make a decision then without basically dwelling on those mistakes and getting wrapped up in the emotion of, you know, having failed. Picking myself up after a failure, I think is my greatest strength. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Early on, I was told to follow my own instincts, follow my own path, understand your strengths and weaknesses and follow that. And I have done that ever since. And I think that has served me well. How about your biggest mentor? So I have had a few people that I admire and that have followed. But ultimately, I think my mom and dad have been my greatest mentors. They instill in me both that intellectual curiosity that we talked about before and that sense of giving back and making the world hopefully a better place. Which investor do you admire most? Probably have to go with the conventional Warren Buffett. You know, we talked about it in this interview, but I've always admired what he did. You know, he created basically a business model that didn't really exist and created a space for himself where, you know, he can invest across economic and credit cycles in multiple industries and obviously has become one of the best investors that we have ever seen. And where do you spend your time outside the office, Jose? You know, to me, the philanthropy aspect is very important, you know, giving back. And then once in a while, I can get out on the golf course. Great. And finally, what are you most excited about in the world right now? So I do think that technology obviously is important in my day job in terms of investing, but I think technology can be used for good. And we're at a point where technology has democratized so many things across the world. Access to knowledge, right, has been democratized. And I'm actually super excited about that because as we talked about before, I think education knowledge is the catalyst for people around the world to improve themselves and improve those around them. So I'm extremely excited about that. Jose, you've always struck me as a guy who has it figured out. You're a great partner to us here at Goldman Sachs. You've developed this platform, which we think is highly differentiated. You give so much back to your communities, and yet you're still a humble guy that seems like he's enjoying the ride. So it's really great for us to share some of that with our listeners today. Thank you, Mike. You know, super excited to be here again, back at Goldman Sachs. And we wouldn't be here without investors like you that believed in us when, you know, we were unproven, we were young. And so in us, you know, a little spark in every single day, we wake up thinking, how can we reward? How can we give back? How can we basically prove you're right? And we're still trying to do that. Great. Thank you all for listening to this episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges Great Investors, which was recorded on September 11th, 2024. I'm Michael Brandmeier.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2024-10-29 04:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### What will the US presidential election mean for the economy?\n**Episode ID:** 4533\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nWhat will the U.S. presidential election mean for the economy? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Each month I speak with investors, policymakers, and academics about the most pressing market-moving issues for our top of mind report from Goldman Sachs Research. This month I spoke with top economists from each party to find out how the upcoming election could impact economic policy. Jared Bernstein is the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Biden, and Kevin Hassett served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump. I spoke to each about a range of economic policies that are on the table that could shape the years ahead. As you might guess, a lot of their views differed pretty starkly, but there were also some interesting points of common ground. I started off by asking how they'd characterize the economic landscape that the next U.S. president will inherit. Here's what current CEA chair Jared Bernstein said. Well, if you think about the macro economy, I'd say they're likely to inherit a solid expansion where inflation has come down from its peak close to target without sacrificing much at all on the economy's growth side. Unemployment's come up a bit, but it remains low. The pace of job gains just over the past three months, 186,000, that's at the north end of the break-even level that most labor economists subscribe to. And very importantly, from the perspective of the Biden-Harris administration, we have rising real wages and incomes, and we've had those ongoing for a while now. However, we have unfinished business when it comes to the housing market, the child care market, clearly extreme weather events are a fundamental issue that we're dealing with and that the next administration will have to deal with. Trade and geopolitical challenges are ongoing as well. So solid macroeconomic background with a set of risks that are well known. I asked the same question of former CEA chair Kevin Hassett. Going into the middle of the summer, there were clear signals in the labor market that we were entering a recession, say around August. And that's why when the Fed cut interest rates 50 basis points, it made sense to me because the SOM rule and other things were kicking off that we were in a recession. But then everything just turned on a dime. And in fact, if you look at the improvement in unemployment since then, since the peak, it's been like one of the sharper improvements in unemployment that we've seen in the history of job market data. So it's a kind of a strange time. It looks like the latest inflation report was pretty troubling for a Federal Reserve that just cut rates. And the weakness that we saw last summer seems to have evaporated. And so I think that there's an open question whether the next administration inherits an economy that's got momentum or the economy that the SOM rule was signaling was headed into recession this summer. And so I say it's kind of a befuddling economy right now. I then asked each to share their views on a range of economic policy proposals. We started with the big one, tariffs. I first turned to Kevin for his thoughts. I think that the expansion of tariffs on China is a very important policy. Developed economies have been shocked by the massive expansion of Chinese corporate espionage because basically the amount of theft of U.S. intellectual property and spying that's going out of the U.S. is really disturbing and it's way outside of the bounds of things that any other country on Earth does. And so I think that China should be kicked out of the WTO probably. I think that however harsh a trade policy a country wants to have towards China, I think that it's deserved. Is it mostly about that theft or are there other unfair trade practices? I think that it's IP theft and it's production of stuff that's geopolitically strategically important. As an example, going back to the steel tariffs during the Trump administration, it's a widely accepted fact that the allies won World War II because of U.S. productive capacity. And when you ask yourself, what was it we were producing that helped us win World War II, then it was mostly steel. Everything had steel in it, right? The tanks, the airplanes. And the Chinese have invested in a massive overcapacity of steel, which really puts them visibly on a war footing. And they're dumping that steel everywhere, trying to close down steel industries everywhere else. If we were to allow our steel industry to just disappear while the Chinese have enough steel capacity to launch an all-out war, then I think we'll have made a serious defense policy error. What about universal tariffs on all U.S. imports? Is that a policy that should be pursued? The RNC in the platform, they have a reciprocal tariff act, like the first tariff policy. And in the reciprocal tariff act, then basically what we would do as U.S. is ignite a game theoretic contest. Pretty much every country has a higher tariff on us than we have on them. The average tariff the countries charge us when we export into the country is like around six and a half, say. And for us, it's about three. And so if we had a reciprocal trade act, then either we would go to six or they would go to three. And it's interesting to think about which it would be, but there are some countries, like the bound tariff for India, which is the maximum they can charge if they want is 50%. And so I think that there's a lot of room for trade policy to approve if we pass a reciprocal trade act. The issue about whether we should have a universal tariff, there's a question of how it would coexist with the reciprocal act. And so I'm a big supporter of a reciprocal act. Maybe the universal tariff becomes a minimum and that's something to be worked out. But recall that the tariff policy has to be passed by Congress. If you have a specific security concern or anti-dumping concern, which are the things that happened in the first Trump administration that the Biden administration kept, then the president does have some authority to put a tariff on the country if they've been dumping or if they're like a threat to national security. But to do something sweeping like the reciprocal act would require legislation. I then asked Jared for his thoughts on tariffs. I think there's a way to think about tariffs that invokes China, but it goes further than that. Targeted tariffs can help protect against unfair trade. And China continues to engage in unfair trade, especially through overcapacity and seeking market share in areas where we're making some pretty deep investments. Those are targeted tariffs. I think the key word there is targeted. So targeted tariffs can be a tool to protect against unfair trade. China is an example where that remains important. But sweeping tariffs, they go beyond helping targeted sectors to broadly and pretty severely hitting consumers and producers. We've talked a lot about how they hurt consumers because they work like a national sales tax. It's very important to remember tariffs on intermediate goods hurt our domestic producers. The way I put it is we're happy to import disinflation. We won't import the industrialization. We still appreciate the benefits of robust trade flows, but we're going to stand up to trading partners who engage in unfair practices that have the potential to hollow out key American sectors. We've seen it happen before. We don't want to stand by while it happens again. So while targeted tariffs can be a useful tool, sweeping tariffs can be really quite disruptive. We then moved on to perhaps the clearest point of differentiation, corporate tax rates. Here's Jared's view. In our budget, we've proposed an increase in corporate tax rates to 28 percent. I think there's some research suggesting some positive investments and growth effects from lower rates. But they tend to be economically very small. If you weigh them against the lost revenue, I can't tell you how many times I've sat with folks from the business community who say, we need to get on a more sustainable fiscal path and you need to cut our taxes. And those two don't necessarily go together. Now, if you want to talk about a tax system that has a much broader base and lower rates, that's certainly a conversation that Washington tries to engage in. But often doesn't get very far because everybody's got their exemption they want. In the world we live in, we need to find a corporate rate that certainly facilitates robust investment and profitability and yet brings in new revenue. We've certainly seen our corporations be highly successful at rates above 28 percent. So we think going to 28 would be a useful change. Now here's Kevin. Take the rate to 28 percent, which would be a 7 percent increase. The largest increase in the developed world in the last 50 years. And a really damaging one if you model it. So if you consider that when we had a 35 percent rate, we went to 21 and the joint tax committee score for the whole thing was about 300 billion over 10 years. So it was almost revenue neutral because of all the international stuff that we did and also the interest deduction. There were a lot of things that were base browners. And by the way, revenue to GDP, corporate revenue to GDP is higher now than it was before the tax cuts by quite a bit. And so the Laffer curve effect that Alex Brill and I wrote a paper 20 years ago showing that the U.S. was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve of corporate tax base and that got proven exposed by the data. And so since it was almost revenue neutral to go to from 35 to 21, 28 percent is going way to the other side of where we were when we were at 35. Because when we were at 35, we had a much smaller base. I also asked about another hot button issue, taxing unrealized capital gains. Here's Jared again. We propose a prepayment tax against future realizations. One thing to recognize is that this only hits taxpayers above 100 million. So the air is awful thin up there. So it's just a few thousand folks. It definitely kicks up the fairness in the code because once you get up there and especially if you incorporate wealth, you see people paying effective tax rates that can be in the single digits. And I want to make another point about this that is probably underappreciated. Well, there are definitely folks who argue, and I understand the argument that unrealized income is not income. Every day you see folks using those assets as collateral for income generating investments. And in that sense, you have these assets working to grow income in a way that's currently not taxed. We understand that this is something that is controversial in many market settings, but we think we can make a good case for it. And here's Kevin's view. I think the tax that you got accrual is it's just a wealth tax is the way to think about it. And wealth taxes are really inefficient in our economic models. If you tax wealth, say at 3%, well, if like the risk free interest rate is 3%, then that's like 100% tax on capital income. And so if you introduce 100% tax on capital income, then let me tell you, then your model is going to blow up. You're not going to have growth. So the thing about wealth taxes and taxing things out of accrual is that it seems like a small tax because say, hey, I'm charging 3% of wealth, it's only a 3% tax. But to think about what the actual low effect of a tax out of stock is, you have to translate it into a tax on capital income. And when you do that with wealth tax proposals, you end up with implicit taxes on capital income that can be close to 100%. And those are really dangerous ideas in terms of the potential harm to the economy. There's also been discussion of expanding child and earned income tax credits. I asked Jared if that was a good idea for the economy. I don't think it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. Both candidates are talking about some version of this. And of course, during the American Rescue Plan, we very significantly increased the CTC, but also the EITC as well. And we know that these measures help to reduce child poverty by half, cut child poverty from something like 12 or 13% to around 6%. And that kind of an intervention has been shown to pay for itself many times over because kids who get a better economic start like that will have a much higher chance of reaching their potential and end up contributing to the economy in ways they wouldn't otherwise. Those are great programs that have huge bang for bucks. I asked Kevin the same question. Right now, families with children certainly are the ones that have been hit hardest by inflation. And I think that one of the problems, right, with an inflationary environment is that there's stuff that you can shift away from and stuff that you can't. And you find the elasticity of consumption for families with children tends to be much lower than for you or for me. We could go to the grocery store and look at the things that went up in price and then switch to other things. But again, families raising kids, they're going to want their milk and their bananas and so on. And so I think that the child credit is a very sound policy in terms of equalizing opportunity, getting money into the hands of people who are raising kids. I don't have a model that tells you what the optimal size of the child credit should be. That's more of a political question. But what about the effects of all of these policies on the government's finances? I asked Jared how important it is to reduce the deficit. Very important. Two things are clear. One is we don't face an imminent threat. I pay attention to this at a very granular level, watching bid cover ratios in our auctions of U.S. treasuries. And there is still very robust demand for U.S. debt, highly liquid, highly efficient market and we are able to fund and service our debt without breaking much of the sweat. That's fact one. Fact two is we have to get on a more sustainable fiscal path. Both of those are true. And the problem is that as long as fact one is true, lawmakers have a very high discount rate for the future when it comes to fact two. It's sort of like that scene in Jaws that says, you're not going to believe there's a shark out there until it bites you. I hope we don't have to wait for a forcing event. But unfortunately, that's often the way these things play out. And here's Kevin's view on reducing the deficit. It will be a priority for whichever administration comes in by necessity because the debt to GDP is so high, the deficit to GDP is so high, the debt limit is hit probably around next March, but they can always fiddle around and get you to June. So there's going to be a big budget showdown next year. But if you look at revenue to GDP and spending to GDP, revenue to GDP, the Trump administration was above historic norms, even with the tax cuts. It's the spending that went up because COVID and then stayed up because it created room for the next administration to continue spending. That's really when you look at the problem, it's not revenue to GDP, at least compared to historic norms, it's spending to GDP, which is 4% of GDP higher than it normally has been. So we could be set for a showdown with both sides potentially agreeing that the deficit should come down, but disagreeing on whether more taxes or reduced spending is the way to get there. And of course, the election will play a major role in determining who wins that fight. Let's leave it there for now. Thank you for listening to this episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges.

I'm Michael Brammeier, Global Head and Chief Investment Officer of the External Investing Group within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Today, I'm very excited to be sitting down with Chelsea Stoner, General Partner of Battery Ventures, which has been investing in technology companies around the world since 1983. Chelsea joined Battery in 2006 and has helped build out the firm's private equity practice. She's been focusing on the ways in which software is transforming a variety of industries and is behind some of the firm's most notable investments to date. We'll be talking with Chelsea about her path to Silicon Valley, Battery's longstanding success as a VC firm, and her unique outlook on the venture capital and private equity landscape. Chelsea, welcome to the program. Thanks for having me, Michael. You grew up in a small town in Northeastern Montana, got a degree in chemical engineering from Northwestern University, and now are one of Silicon Valley's leading growth investors. How did you find your way to venture? Not a straight path from rural Montana to Silicon Valley growth. Yeah, I had a very circuitous path and just a lot of people along the way who believed in me and gave me a chance. I think that, you know, is really what it's all about. Just to start, I decided to do chemical engineering because I liked chemistry and math, not because I had any idea what chemical engineers did. Once I learned a little bit more about that, I decided I didn't want to do it. I did so many internships of being in dark labs with not very many people and it just wasn't my personality. It doesn't seem to suit your personality. It wasn't my personality. So I ended up doing what a lot of college grads who don't quite know what they want to do yet, and I became a consultant, which was amazing. It was a really great experience. I traveled the world. I was able to work with some really great clients on interesting projects. I had a lot of responsibility at a very young age and decided to go back and get my MBA. I had never taken an econ class studying engineering. And so I chose Chicago and I got a finance degree there, which is really where I learned about investing. I had no clue about investing before that. I mean, really at a fundamental level and all of the case studies we did, the more I learned, I just became really enamored with it and thought of it as this marriage between the quantitative skills that I had and that I loved and the people side, the human side of the business. Yeah, it's funny. I had a similar experience. So I think when I graduated from college, I was an international relations major and I'm not even sure I knew who Goldman Sachs was back then. And then for me, it was in business school that I figured out about this thing investing and I never looked back. And so it's interesting and it's similar. I'm curious, you know, one of the hallmarks of the things you do is at least among, I think your LPs, you have a reputation of kind of going anywhere to find investments. Some people in the venture world will only drive along the 280 quarter in the Bay area, if I have the road, right, to find investments, but you'll go pretty far afield. I don't know if your upbringing in rural America has anything to do with that or, you know, how does that inform your approach? I think so. I think it's the recognition that there's smart people and innovation everywhere. And on the coast, we see clusters, but there's innovation everywhere. And so if it takes a little bit of extra effort to take two planes to get to Burlington, Vermont, or Bainbridge Island, Washington, Sydney, Australia, I mean, we've done deals kind of all over the place and have found, I think, some really great returns because a lot of folks haven't done that. Now, times are changing. The last, you know, few years, especially, have gotten more and more competitive. And I think, you know, people are turning up in these kind of off the beaten path places. Have you found that post-COVID with talent going from the big metropolitan areas to the midsize cities that there is more innovation? I think that was a key trigger. I don't know about if it sparked more innovation. It's certainly allowed for talent to hook up with the tech companies kind of anywhere and everywhere. And from an investor perspective, what I did, I mean, we were, you know, investing in companies and buying companies online, right, for a couple of years. And so it exposed investors to companies they maybe wouldn't have traveled to before because it was so much easier to do Zoom meetings than it was to get on a plane or two planes or three planes to get there. Yeah. Look, I would say great for you, but also great for the country in the sense that we need innovation everywhere to grow. I want to pivot and talk about Battery Ventures a little bit. It is such a storied franchise. It goes back to 1983, as I mentioned in the introduction. And I feel like Battery is a firm that in a very dynamic sector that is always changing, has navigated generational transition and all the change in Silicon Valley so well. So talk a little bit about the heritage of Battery and why you think you've navigated the last 40 years so well. Yeah, I think, you know, a lot of it has to do with the founders and the way that they constructed it from the beginning. I mean, we've gone through maybe three and a half generational transitions that have had different models along the way. And I think all of us feel like we are stewards of the firm. It's not, you know, my firm. It's not anybody's one person's firm. It's all of ours. And then we're planning to leave it in the best hands for the next generation, right? And what can we do to make it better along the way? But I think a lot of it is kind of the way that it was constructed, very elegant in design, even from the management company to the governance to the dealmaking decision. I guess we're on our fourth kind of governance model where we have an executive committee. So there's not one managing partner right now. We have four of us that are part of this executive committee. And what it does is it enables us to continue doing what we love to do, which is invest and understanding that there's so much that goes into running a firm administratively, strategically. And it allows us to split those tasks among the four of us so that we have time to do the bulk of what we want to do is invest. I mean, you know, it's really interesting. We obviously look at managers across every asset class and there's no asset class where the human capital element of it is more important than a venture because you're going back right to the inception and you're there when a company is starting or when it's on this hyper growth path. And having people focused on finding those assets and then nurturing those assets is just so critical. And so how you get the most out of your team. I mean, you can't have just one person sitting there doing it. You have to harness that collective wisdom of a team. And I think your setup in many ways has done it as well or better than anybody else. That's exactly right. And so when you talk about generational transition, it's less about having one person that runs everything. And if we lose that person, you know, something's going to fall apart. It's rather it's in all of the general partners and folks around the table. And we really think of ourselves as developing talent, right? I mean, that is so foundational to the firm. And we hope that analysts who start with us end up being the next generation of partners along the way. And we do a lot of our processes, a lot of the ways that we make decisions from a deal perspective really center around that and growing and seeing people come up and make sure that we understand their deal judgment along the way. Yeah. One of the things I find really interesting about your decision-making process is how you actually make sure that you have all the right expertise for individual decisions around the table. Talk about that. That's right. Yeah. So we have an investment committee process like any firm would, but it's very different. And so we'll pick the investment committee members based on their knowledge of a particular end market, or maybe it's a specific deal type, or maybe it's a geographical region that we're looking at. There's generally two to three partners who sit on any given IC. And the decision-making process is really in the hands of the deal team because in software, there's just so much nuance in product market. And we really firmly that it's the team on the ground doing all of the work, the detailed work to get that nuance, who's going to have the best educated knowledge of the space and decision-making. And to get an entire IC up to speed on that when deals are happening pretty quickly is a feat. And groupthink is a real thing. And a lot of our best deals, by the way, have kind of on the low side of votes from the IC. So it's really interesting to see that, how that kind of works. Yeah. I want to just pause on that for one minute because I think it's such an interesting insight that in the technology industry where you almost have to be a contrarian, if you're a me too, right, most of these industries are winner-take-all or winner-take-most, you're not going to make much money. But doing things that are non-consensus is so important. And I think it's really interesting that you've developed this governance process that allows that to happen, but in a very supported way. I want to pivot and talk a little bit about your approach to the general market. So battery is stage agnostic. And so for those of you in the audience that are not as steeped in venture, the way that most venture capital firms work is they focus on the early stage, so either seed or A funding rounds. And then for some of the bigger firms, they've developed companies as they get larger. So they might have a seed early stage fund, then they might have a growth fund, and then they might have a late stage growth fund. And that's how the industry is developed. Whereas a battery, you are stage agnostic within your single fund. Why does that approach work for you? The power of being stage agnostic, I've come to really appreciate it, especially in markets like this. But we consider ourselves fundamentally tech experts, software, to be specific, with about 85% of what we do is software between infrastructure and application. And really understanding and seeing the full breadth of software businesses from early stage to more mature businesses is very powerful to help make decisions and be able to look across the spectrum. So we're, as you know, Michael, very thesis driven, very thematic driven, we'll go very deep in a particular end market or industry. And oftentimes we find we thought this was a really interesting growth opportunity, but you know what, it's more of a buyout play because it's a very sticky market, hard to get legacy players out. And so that is the better way to play that particular end market. And so we'd love to deploy capital after all that hard work of figuring out a market, where the best risk reward is. And so it's just been very powerful as an investor. I tend to focus more on our later stage businesses and seeing what's happening on the innovation side has kept me from doing some maybe challenging deals because things change and things get disrupted so quickly. Yeah, it also, I think once again, speaks to the partnership at Battery and the collaboration that is just part of the culture there. And it just makes you better investors. Absolutely. Absolutely. So you mentioned later stage, Battery asked you in 2006, I believe, to focus on private equity. And at the time that was like totally non-consensus, right? I mean, no one was doing private equity. And as a matter of fact, some of your competitors are now hiring people to focus on private equity. So we can get onto that in a minute. But what did Battery see back in 06? It's so funny to think about it because people still don't really realize that we do private equity. But yeah, I mean, think about the audacity of a venture firm. We did one of the first take privates in software ever in 2003, a small ERP business called Made to Manage that became this great, great return for us. And I think it was that recognition of, oh, that's interesting. We should be thinking about investing along the spectrum as software has matured. So should our investing style. And there's opportunities, like I said, kind of everywhere. And how can we best play it? And so they did this take private then. And I got a call a couple of years later as they were thinking about, gosh, there's something to this. There's some more interesting opportunities. And there certainly will be over time as more and more software companies become mature. Maybe we should bring some skill set who have looked at financial models and know how to think about debt and have relationships with debt providers and kind of build out the buyout effort in a more formal way. And so I got a call in 2006. I was doing middle market private equity out in San Francisco and Neeraj Agarwal, who was a principal at Battery, called me. He had heard from a friend. I think we got introduced from a friend. And he said, do you want to come to Boston? Heck, yeah. Packed up and moved out. And the rest is history 18 years later. Right. It's interesting. And I think a lot of people think buyout and they think, oh, steady two to three X returns. But you guys have had some huge multiples in private equity. And I don't know if other people are now noticing that, but it's been a really successful effort for you. Yeah, we have. We've found some venture returns in lower risk buyout land, which has been great. And it just goes back to really understanding the product markets very deeply. And I chalk that up to it allows us to find alpha and into kind of gaps that others aren't necessarily looking. Sometimes it's in a different geo. Sometimes it's, you know, a certain feature of a product. We just do so much market work and understand that that's really going to take off and accelerate. Sometimes it's the flexibility to just not be kind of boxed into a particular deal type. Like I remember when I first started, this was when, you know, cloud was just kind of becoming a thing and recurring revenue was just becoming a thing. It was more of the license maintenance on premise model. And there were firms who needed to invest. You had to have at least 10 million of revenue. You had to be profitable and you had to be growing 30 percent. Well, there was a lot that was left on the table because of that box that they were in. And we understood, hey, this is a cloud model. They're probably not going to be profitable until they're kind of 20 million or above. And so just understanding it very, very well enables you to take what others might think is very risky bets, but you know something. Right. And so you can give them the courage to migrate their model, which in retrospect now seems obvious since most things are SAS. But exactly at the time. Yeah, it was a big leap. Big leap. Yeah. So fast forward to today, there's been a lot of talk just in the industry about what's happened with so many companies have been funded over the last five years. You had this this bubble in tech that happened and now you're not seeing any exits. And so the exit spigot is a little bit broken right now. It will get fixed. It will get fixed over time. Valuations will settle. But there's a thousand private unicorns out there and a relatively small percentage of them are actually to get public. So how are you seeing the opportunities set today? It must be pretty interesting. Yeah, it should be more interesting, frankly, because of everything you described. And we actually met with your team last week to understand kind of their IPO pipeline. And it is vast and ever expanding. And you think, gosh, it's going to take five or six years for all these to get public. Clearly, they're not. And so that is the opportunity. But I think what was interesting is during covid, it forced this focus on cash flow. And so many of these companies were able to continue their runway by, you know, many had had layoffs. A lot of our portfolio went through that because we were so maniacal on making sure that folks had enough runway. And so we haven't quite seen the need for additional raises yet for a lot of these companies that have decelerated growth. Yeah, or probably more. It's probably more a question of time as to whether it's going to happen. It's going to happen. Right. It needs to happen. It's just like, I guess the other question is, will there be a cultural shift in Silicon Valley where a lot of the lead investors will realize that consolidation needs to happen? And maybe a lot of those companies stuck in the middle or the ones that aren't even unicorns, they're going to have to give up on the dream on that being a billion or five billion dollar company and figure out a way to work together. And I wonder if that's part of the unlock. That's right. Yeah, that takes a while. And it's so interesting. Many of the capital structures of these companies have lots of players around the table with very different challenges or incentives. And so corralling that all into one exit strategy is tough. And so we're thinking through how can we be helpful in that and maybe come up with some different capital structure ideas? Yep. Yep. Well, from a skill set and personality standpoint, if there's anyone that can, I think, marshal some interesting solutions among this interesting cast of characters, I think you're very well positioned. You focus on software, as you mentioned, what's happening in the AI space. There's been a lot of talk about NVIDIA and the hardware of AI. You're more focused on vertical software. So industry specific software. Just talk a little bit about the audience, about that focus and what that is. And then let's get into how AI is changing your opportunities. Yeah, no, happy to. As we think about AI, at least as it relates to the application layer, data is king, right? I mean, these models, if they're all trained on the same data, there's not much differentiation. And so when you have something, some data that others don't have access to, what can you do with that? And of course, a lot of our industry specific vertical software companies have data that nobody else has. And so there's a lot of really interesting things that you can do with that information with Gen AI. You can train models on it to go through the data and look for interesting insights for your customers or your patients from a clinical perspective. One of our companies sells practice management software to the dental space, which by the way, hasn't transitioned to cloud yet. It's still, I think it's less than 5%, which is amazing. It's a huge, huge market and still they have service underneath their desk. And so Curve is trying to help them get there. But they just have, they have so many customers and so many reams of patient data that can be really great when it comes to what insights can I give the dentist while they're in with the patient? One of the solutions actually is able to find cavities or close to cavities before the human eye would be able to see it. And so right when you're in the chair, your dentist can say, okay, it looks like you're developing a cavity here. You might want to take some measures or how can we prevent that from happening? So on the preventative care front, there's just a lot of opportunity. So when you think about applications like that, do you think about AI as something that creates moats around more segmented businesses because the data is important or does that create a means of consolidation of bringing other proprietary data into the tooling that you've developed? And then once again, you have winner takes all or a few take the industries. It's really interesting as it relates to data. And if you think about the data players out there, Databricks, one of our companies is one of them. Snowflake enables you to get all of the data into one area so that you can train Gen AI and use Gen AI and all of that data. So if you think about that, you don't necessarily need all of the players coming together, right? And the winner take all, you can still have them give up their data to one location if you're a customer. And healthcare is going through this whole kind of trend right now, which is desperately needed, as we all know. Right. I mean, in some cases you could see horizontal software being a good solution, but in some cases, why would the customers now give up their data given these solutions are different? So it'll be interesting to see how it evolves. Yeah, exactly right. And I don't think that they'll give up their data. It's more of how can they use it for themselves, right, in different aspects. And I just keep coming back to the hospital because it's kind of a glaring issue right now, which across the hospital, there might be, you know, 10 to 20 different EMRs, clinical systems used, each having their own database that, you know, everything's stored in. And so bringing that into one location for that one hospital to even be able to see across their patients is super important and really hasn't been done yet. You know, when I talked to my friends that invest in healthcare, I hear about all these amazing things that are happening. It really is transformational. And yet, if you go to the country at large, everyone is still basically frustrated with their healthcare. You're an expert. You focus on healthcare. When do you think that this starts to translate much more into our actual healthcare system? And I mean, is this a 30-year thing or do you think in the next five or 10 years, healthcare delivery will feel different? I think it will feel different faster. And I do think it's Gen AI that's really going to be the trigger for this. The government has tried to regulate information sharing and, you know, making sure that, you know, at least patients can access their information across all of their providers into one place. Even that hasn't really gotten us very far. And I think, you know, the recognition by the providers of being able to have meaningful clinical outcomes and, you know, suggestions based on going through so many different patient information in one place, I think is going to be very powerful. And they recognize that. So it is happening, but I think there needed to be a forcing function and this is a great one. Right. Well, you think about both quality of outcome and cost of delivery both benefit massively. Exactly. So there's a lot to go for. Exactly. So given the state evaluations in the macro environment, just battery in general, what are you seeing out there that's particularly interesting right now? You know, we've been seeing a lot of opportunity in the series A deals, very early stage. Yeah. And because of our model, we can morph and be flexible to where that opportunity is best. And right now, anyway, that's tended to be very early stage. I wouldn't say pre-product market fit after product market fit is there. And then on the very other end of the spectrum, on the more mature side of things. So we've seen a lot of activity around buyouts, particularly in Europe. We've done a couple in Canada recently. And so again, because we're so flexible, able to go anywhere from a stage perspective and, you know, most anywhere from a geo perspective. And so we've been kind of hunting everywhere. And that's the two ends of the barbell, I guess, is where we've seen the best opportunities so far. Yeah. It sounds like there's still a pretty big, big ass spread, especially in the mid and late stage on valuations because they got so stretched in 21, they came down and you've had growth, but still, it seems like they're a gap. How long do you think it takes that to play out? Massive gap. It's a really, really great question. Growth right now is really tough. I mean, first of all, growth rates have come down so much. And so we're looking at anything north of kind of 50% growth and the multiples are just sky high back to kind of COVID days. I think part of that is also because there's so much capital chasing those few opportunities. There were a lot of growth funds raised and I'm a hammer, everything's a nail. And so I need to go find the growth deals that are out there. And so I come back to the blessing that we have being stage agnostic. We don't have to do growth deals. We find other opportunities to play, but I think it's going to take a while for us to get through the capital. And then at the same time, kind of get back to the accelerated growth that more companies should see. Right. Chelsea, you're one of the leading women leaders in venture capital. And obviously many of us would love to see many more women leaders in venture and other leading industries. What do you think we can all do collectively to facilitate that? Yeah. I love the question because I think it is a collective thing and we need the men in the room to help us along the way. And I come back to, it's all about getting the opportunity. I mean, that's all we need. We can prove ourselves once we're there. And this industry is great because it is a true meritocracy. Data is what matters. And if you don't have returns, you shouldn't be here. But how do you get here in the first place? And I think that's really where I feel so lucky that somebody took a big risk on me from multiple dimensions. So it's about getting to those folks, getting to diverse candidates earlier. And one thing that we've done at Battery, we used to hire more experienced folks out of investment banks largely. And we've moved to earlier where we're now hiring straight from college. And it's had a really meaningful impact. The last few classes of analysts that we've had have been at least 50-50, you know, from a diversity perspective, if not more. And so I think it's getting to folks early and showing them that it can be a really great profession. They might not know about it, right, while they're trying to figure out what they want to do after college. And so we have an internship program that, again, kind of leads into the analyst program. Right. Yeah. We had another friend on the podcast, Lauren Taylor Wolf, who said, you can't be what you can't see. Exactly. I think it's such a good example. And you're absolutely right. At Goldman, we are very focused on the pipeline. We have been for a long time. But this really has to be done through cultivating talent for a very long period of time. There's not a one-year fix. And it requires a very long-term focus. Yeah, absolutely. It takes a while. So we like to round out these sessions with a lightning round. Okay. So I'm going to run you through a few questions here. What is your greatest strength as an investor? Oh, I would say kind of a combo. So bear with me for a second. I love data. I'm a data geek. And I think just the analytical skills have given me an ability to maybe see things that others maybe didn't see, maybe signals through the noise, if you will. I would say I'm also incredibly focused, sometimes so much so maybe, you know, blinders on, but it's enabled me to avoid FOMO. And so I kind of stay on my path and do it, not get distracted by what others are doing and feel badly about it. And then, you know, I think one skill that, you know, maybe overlooked a bit, but we have it in spades at battery is just humility. My parents raised me to be humble. And it's, I think, really important in investing to recognize you don't know everything. And it, you know, kind of forces me to dig deeper and deeper and deeper to build the confidence, which makes me smarter, you know, from an investor. And especially when we're looking at, you know, specific product markets that require a lot of deep dives. So long-winded answer to your lighting round question, Michael. Sorry. Not at all. I mean, the piece on FOMO particularly resonates because in venture, it's not easy. It's not easy to avoid FOMO. You talked about the mentorship that you received along the way. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Oh, that time is your most scarce resource. I used to take loads of any meeting that wanted to meet with me, any conference I would go to. And I think just recognizing, you know, I need to prioritize things that I don't have time to do everything. Right. Also, to some extent, this is all about longevity as well. And if you're running yourself ragged, that's that's hard. Yes. Which investor do you admire most? It's hard not to say Buffett. It's just on so many levels. Right. So but I think everybody probably says Buffett. You know, I really respect Ray Dalio and his data driven nature and his last book of, you know, changing world order was phenomenal. Yes. And so I think from that aspect, I think he's great from multiple dimensions there. Yes. Yes. We're Bridgewater fans as well. And how about your biggest mentor? My biggest mentor, I'd say Neeraj Agarwal, who is a partner at Battery, the one who hired me, he and Dave Tabor's hired me. And he's brilliant. He's world class at what he does and really taught me product market. I was a model junkie before, really focused on the financials. And this world of product market is so important to investing in what we do. And what do you like to do outside the office? Oh, I growing up in Montana, I'm a huge outdoors fan. And so anything that I can do outdoors, running, hiking, skiing, we do a ton of skiing as a family. It's such a good family sport to do. Totally agree. And then finally, what are you most excited about in the world right now? Oh, you know, there's so much happening in biotech. We don't invest in the space, but there's just seemingly a lot of really interesting science happening. One of my friends is a neurologist at UCSF and has a lab and has for a long time really focused on very meaningful areas. One of them is dementia research, and she has been doing a lot with clotho, which is a protein in the brain. And it's really, really exciting work. I think she's on the cusp of something really big. Amazing. Well, it's always so fascinating talking to Chelsea. We're so grateful for our partnership with you. We're so grateful for our partnership with Battery, and it's just been great to have you here. We're grateful for you as well. Thanks for having me, Michael.

How much more upside should investors expect, and what could drive those gains? The idea that the economy is growing suggests that if fair value is around the current level, then the forward trajectory of the index is going to be driven by earnings, as opposed to a valuation expansion. I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I'm sitting down with David Koston and Ryan Hammond from our U.S. Portfolio Strategy team in Goldman Sachs Research. They recently boosted their year-end and 12-month targets for the S&P 500. Let's find out why. David, Ryan, thanks for joining us. Thank you, Alison. Thank you. David, we spoke to you earlier this year. The S&P has been on nothing but a tear, minus a bit of a blip in August. But if we think about where we are today, at new record highs again, what have been the primary drivers of this rally, especially in recent months? I think you can think about the rally, Alison, two ways. The first is it's been equally driven by earnings growth and valuation expansion. That is different from calendar 2023, when it was almost about 75% of that return came from a increase in valuation. So the first part of it is earnings and valuation. The second is the largest stocks in the market that get all of the visibility, often known by the term Magnificent Seven. Those stocks are up 36% this year. The typical stock is up around 17%. So in aggregate, as you pointed out, the index level is up around 25% as we speak today. And that's driven in part by these biggest stocks that helped lift the overall index. And if we think about earnings, are they doing better than we expected coming into the year? Is this just a reflection of the strength of the economy or what's driving that earnings growth? Ryan? Yeah, an economy that's growing usually means earnings are growing. But part of the reason why we upgraded our S&P 500 price targets was because of better earnings growth than we previously assumed. So our previous forecast was for 6% earnings growth in 2025. We raised that to 11% earnings growth, both on the back of solid economic data, but also some micro factors related to semiconductors, these mega cap tech stocks that David mentioned, and some one-time charges that are affecting earnings in 2024. So we're feeling pretty good about how companies are performing in terms of earnings. So when we think about this strong earnings growth that led us to upgrade our earnings forecast for this year, again, we talked about economic expansion being a key driver. Does that mean that the consumer is in good shape, people are just buying more things, the economy is buoyant? Well, as we look out into the next year, we have an overall macro view that the economy is growing. The unemployment rate is staying low. The Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates, along with central banks around the world. That is a supportive backdrop for equities, generally speaking. And that is a key input as one of the assumptions in our overall earnings model. Valuation, with the idea of interest rates staying relatively close to the current level, maybe the 10-year U.S. treasury yield rising to around a little over 4% in the coming year, that is consistent with, in our models, a level of the S&P 500 in a year's time around 6,300, which would be about 8% higher than the current level of the market. But if we look at valuations, Ryan, today, there's been a lot of concern, I think, going into this year that valuations were looking stretched. I mean, isn't that more the case today now that we're sitting at record high levels? Yes, there's no doubt that valuations are high relative to history. Or if you look at them relative to interest rates, they're also historically stretched. And even if you look at the typical stock, they're relatively stretched. So for some context, the S&P 500, the cap-weighted index trades at 22 times forward earnings. That's in the 95th percentile versus history, the only times you've had higher valuations were in COVID and the tech bubble. But even if you look at the equal-weight S&P 500, which controls for some of the big mega-cap tech stocks, that trades at 17 times, which also ranks in the 95th percentile versus history. So large-cap equity valuations are stretched versus history. But our macro model, as David mentioned, growth that is solid, a Federal Reserve that is able to start cutting, inflation that is largely near the Fed's target, our model suggests that valuations are actually roughly in line with fair value based on that macro backdrop. A big part of that valuation premium of the cap-weighted index is the fact that those mega-cap tech stocks have faster growth, higher margins, stronger balance sheets, and that commands a valuation premium that pushes the aggregate index valuation up. Yes, they are high versus history. There's other places in the market that you can find value like in mid-caps or small-cap equities. But our macro models do suggest that they can stay around these levels through the end of this year. And the idea that the economy is growing suggests that if fair value is around the current level, then the forward trajectory of the index is going to be driven by earnings as opposed to a valuation expansion. I think that's an important conclusion that we reached in our research. Right. So you're not expecting further expansion in valuation. So is this really just a play on the economy? Essentially, if economy holds up, we expect it to hold up, companies are going to perform well. That is a reasonable and reductive perspective on the idea of the overall U.S. equity market. On the other hand, as Ryan indicated, one of the most compelling opportunity sets we find is in mid-cap stocks, because if the overall index level is at fair value, where are things that are undervalued, and we would identify mid-cap stocks. You could think of the S&P 400 index, mid-cap stocks, anywhere from $5 to $25 billion in market cap. Those companies are expected to have similar kind of growth rates but trade at 15 times forward earnings as opposed to 22 times for the overall S&P 500 index. We think that's a much better opportunity at the valuation level, and they have historically had much greater torque to the idea of the Fed cutting interest rates over three months, over a year's time horizon. They've tended to outperform, and they have a long-term track record of outperformance. So within the market, the opportunity set mid-caps we think is most attractive. So there are pockets of the overall market where you can see valuation expansion. Let's talk about the other side of the spectrum. You mentioned it, the stocks that have driven the rally, the very large-cap stocks. Where are we today in terms of them driving these results, and how much will they contribute to the forward outlook? Yeah, so there's no doubt that those stocks have powered the aggregate index higher. Just one stock, NVIDIA, alone accounts for more than 20% of this year's S&P 500 return. But I think that does mask a little bit of what has gone on throughout the course of the year. Market breadth, a measure of how concentrated returns are by a given group of stocks, has ebbed and flowed throughout this year. In the beginning part of the year, when AI optimism was really moving to a high, those stocks powered the market higher, and market breadth was quite narrow. But over the summer, you did start to see the Equal Weight Index outperform the Cap Weighted Index. In other words, the typical stock has started to participate in this year's rally. Both the typical stock and the aggregate index are up on the year, delivering pretty healthy returns. I think that breadth is now roughly in line with historical averages based on our typical measures of that. I would say, taking a step back, concentration is still a huge issue facing the market. The six largest mega-cap tech stocks today make up 30% of S&P market cap. The trajectory of those companies will be an important factor in considering the forward path over the next 12 months. But today, breadth looks relatively healthy from our perspective. COLLEEN O'BRIEN And Ryan, you've done a lot of work on the AI sector in particular, and we think about that theme as driving the market. But some doubts have been raised about the potential of the technology and whether companies along the different phases of its development will actually perform. Where are we in that cycle, and where is the most opportunity relative to the AI theme today? RYAN VERNON Yeah, so our research has really focused on four phases of the AI trade. NVIDIA was the clearest near-term winner from the development of the technology, phase one. Then we identified phase two as being those infrastructure stocks involved in the build-out of that technology. That could be utilities companies to power some of those data centers, the other technology hardware companies to build them out. And then phase three was companies that have revenues that are exposed to AI. They have AI-enabled revenues that can monetize this technology. And then phase four was every company using this technology to become more productive and increase their sales or margins at their company. From our conversations with clients, and I think from the performance perspective, you can see the most confidence and conviction among investors in phase two, the infrastructure. Hyperscalers, these leading mega-cap tech stocks, are spending billions of dollars on this technology. And therefore, investors have a lot of confidence that this technology will get built. So anything exposed to that phase two infrastructure has done quite well this year. But now, as you highlighted, many investors have started to raise some skepticism about the returns on those investments and the ability to monetize AI. And so phase three has really not participated in this rally in recent months. And obviously, we still think we're a while away from those productivity gains really coming to fruition in phase four. So from our perspective, it still seems like phase two is really the emphasis with investors, anything involved with the infrastructure. But we are getting later in that trade where we start to think earnings will be the primary driver of that rather than valuation and excitement from investors. Right. So they'll have to start to monetize some of that investment in order to see another leg up in, let's say, phase two, relative to this theme, at least. That's right. I think a lot of the rally in those phase two stocks has been valuation-driven in anticipation of those earnings coming to utilities companies and technology hardware companies. But now I think investors are really looking to see that we have a third quarter earnings season upcoming. That'll be another important litmus test, I think, for whether or not you're seeing signs of that in the fundamentals. David, let's talk about third quarter earnings season. It's just kicking off. What are your expectations and what are investors watching? Well, I think the best way to think about it is the hurdle for third quarter results is plus 4%. That's 4% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. Put that in context, for the last five or six quarters, you've had around 500 basis points of positive surprise. If that trend was to continue, then a 4% expectation, increase that by five percentage points by closer to 9%. We'll call that bid-ask somewhere between 4% and 9% would be characterized as a positive earnings season. I think that's likely where things are going to end up. It is important to understand that that is a deceleration from plus 11%, which we saw last quarter. Plus 11% down to expectations around plus 4%, I think a little bit higher than that this quarter. On that point, even though we do think that's a relatively low bar for companies to clear for third quarter results, a lot of investor focus will be on the future earnings trajectory of these companies. 2025 earnings estimates, we think will gradually get revised down. If you compare our top-down earnings forecast for next year relative to the consensus of bottom-up analysts, we are below those numbers. We do think you'll start to see some negative revisions to 2025 estimates. Actually, you all just put out 2026 estimates. How much are investors focused on that? I would say based on our conversations, still most of the focus is on 2025, but 2026 to us looks more like a trend year, both from an economic perspective. Our economists have roughly 2% real GDP growth annual average in 2026. That should lead to modest sales growth, roughly 4% in line with nominal GDP growth. We have slight margin expansion, but not as much as we're expecting to see in 2025. Taking that all together, that's about 7% earnings growth in 2026, a deceleration relative to 2025, but still very healthy from a historical perspective. Right. We're kind of penciling that in, though, at this point. I mean, it does feel a ways away. Definitely. Okay. And if we think about where we are today in an investor's mindset, David, we've talked about all this positive momentum in the economy and in earnings. We'll see what third quarter earnings brings, but are you sensing that investors are just getting a bit uneasy investing at what is now record high levels on the index? There is some concern in terms of our conversations with portfolio managers, and most of the discussion is around the risk to inflation, and the idea that inflation could be higher than the market our investors are expecting. As a consequence, the Fed might therefore cut interest rates less dramatically than is currently expected in the forward market, and that would have a downward effect on the level of multiple for the S&P 500. So I think the inflation rates and valuation are the areas of most concern. There is relatively less pushback we get on the subject of earnings and profits for most companies, so it's really a valuation story. Interesting. And if we think about the investor base right now, does everyone own the S&P 500 at this point? I mean, it's been a fantastic trade. You would think that people are exceptionally long. Is that the case? And if so, does that present risk in thinking about the forward outlook? Yeah. So our tools to measure positioning, our preferred tool is the sentiment indicator that we built, which looks at positioning for institutional, retail, foreign investors, and compares that relative to history. And so the latest reading on that was 0.4 standard deviations stretched. So usually we're looking for something, one standard deviation in stretched territory or negative one standard deviation in light territory to say positioning is a very clear headwind or a tailwind. And so from our perspective, it looks like neither a tailwind or a headwind. People have exposure to equities that has increased in recent weeks as people have gotten more confident about Fed cuts and the state of the economic cycle, but it does not look extreme by historical standards. Two things can happen at the same time. We see money going into money market mutual funds, inflows into cash. At the same time, equity valuations are rising, equity index is rising. So from an asset allocation perspective, the weighting of equities in a mixed asset portfolio for the typical individual, households, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, their asset allocation hasn't really changed. Money goes into cash, equity prices have been rising, and their allocation stays relatively constant. It is at the highest level in about 70 years. So the allocation to equities is extremely high. To your point, people own the index, the money goes into ETFs, other products that are basically index. I think one of the conclusions that we have in our forecast is the idea that perhaps the mid-cap stocks or an equal weighted index, perhaps likely to outperform in the coming year, as opposed to the aggregate index where valuations at 22 times earnings are very, very high. I mean, is there any potential buyer of U.S. equities that is under-invested and could come in as new buyers? We think the main buyer for equities in 2025 will be corporates through corporate buybacks. So we just updated our flow of fund forecast for buyers and sellers of equities in 2025, and we forecast $1 trillion of net buying from corporates, the biggest source of demand. That has been the case for many years, and we think it's going to continue to be the case in 2025. If you look at the other groups of investors, many of them will be net sellers of equities, outflows from mutual funds, net selling from mutual funds, net selling from insurance and pension funds. And then really households is one of the more interesting ones. As David mentioned, there's a lot of money sitting in money market funds. Some investors wonder whether or not that money will flow into equities. The historical precedent around Fed cutting cycles suggests that does not always happen. In fact, you do generally see inflows into money market funds still. And so we think households would be on the margin, net buyers, but relatively small. Really, corporates are the one that we think will be stepping in to buy. So David, how much of this is all going to be impacted by the election? A lot of uncertainty. Are investors pausing ahead of it? And you think that that will unwind once the election happens? What are you expecting heading into the end of the year? So from a tactical perspective, the historical pattern is that equity prices go down heading into an election. Volatility rises and equity prices are weak in the month leading up to the election. And then once the uncertainty is resolved, by definition, when the election occurs, the equity market tends to rally. And so if we think about tactically, perhaps weakness in the coming weeks, but ultimately at the end of the year, we would see the S&P 500 index closing at around 6,000. And if we look out 12 months, closer to around 6,300. And that's our forecast. So the market seems like it's looking through some of this election uncertainty at this point. What is the biggest risk to your forecast? You mentioned inflation resurging, people questioning whether the Fed is going to cut rates. Is that really the biggest risk you're focusing on? The biggest proximate risk is undoubtedly geopolitics. So I would say that's the first, most present risk. From a fundamental perspective, the U.S. economy seems quite strong. A lot of focus on what the fiscal stimulus is likely to be in China, questions that come up a lot in investor conversations, and the trajectory of economic activity in Europe. But within the United States, it's actually a pretty optimistic perspective in terms of the unemployment rate staying very low, the economic activity from GDP growth still pretty strong. And that is what ultimately drives sales and the trajectory of corporate activity. Right. So if the business cycle starts to look like it's faltering again, that's the biggest risk. That would be a risk. But we don't anticipate that given the CEO confidence has come back, the valuations of the equity market have come back. And so that's a pretty positive backdrop for the market right now. David, Brian, thanks so much for your time. Thank you, Alison. Thank you.

I'm your host, Tony Pascarello, Global Head of Hedge Fund Coverage for our Global Banking and Markets business. And today I'm thrilled to be joined by my friend, Karen Carnell-Tambor, who is Co-Chief Investment Officer at Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. At Bridgewater, Karen oversees the systemization of the research into trading strategies, manages the development of proprietary investment models, and directs the design and implementation of client investment strategies. Karen also co-leads the firm's sustainable investing efforts. We'll be talking with Karen about her decades-long career at Bridgewater, how she's thinking about the macro factors shaping investing today, and her lessons for creating strong investment cultures and strong teams. Karen, welcome to the program. Great to be here, Tony. I want to talk a little bit about the U.S. macro landscape. As we sit here today, things are in a friendly place. U.S. GDP growth is tracking around 3%. The Fed obviously just cut rates by 50 basis points. So let's start with your outlook for the economy. Can the U.S. sustain this level of growth? I actually think it can. It's a very unique spot to be in so late into an expansion. But you have this expansion where the Fed already raised rates, right? So it's cut off all the borrowing by anyone in the private sector. And typically, obviously, that causes a recession. This time around, it was offset by kind of the tail of the fiscal coming out of COVID, plus the fact that that was kind of the time where the income cycle took off, and you started getting this self-reinforcing cycle where spending leads to more income, leads to more spending. That's a much more sustainable way to have an expansion. It runs out of steam, but a lot more slowly. And while the employer market's weakened, a lot of the weakening is really from the supply side. It's not really weakening coming from the demand side. And so you add that up, and then you have a Fed easing into that. What the Fed's going to do through the easing is it's actually going to try to restart the private sector borrowing. So that's a pretty good tailwind that's coming in. That's all really on the household side. Then you add the business side, where I think the capex cycle is just starting out, could get bigger. And you hear the mag sevens talking about how they feel like the risk of not investing is a lot greater than the risk of investing too much, that it's existential, that they got to do more. And that's just the couple big mag seven, of course, they're large and they have a lot of money, but you could easily imagine a world where that spreads. And all it'll take is one AI-powered startup in your industry to say, wait a minute, I better go invest a lot in AI as well. You can look back to the 1990s and that mid-cycle easing and how big the capex cycle and internet boom was to powering the next leg. I think this is about as good of a backdrop as you could get so long into an expansion to be able to sustain growth. And you have a Fed that with inflation where it is, is both willing and able to do more if it needs to. And so let's spend a minute on that piece on the Fed. Again, we've entered the next stage of the game in the monetary cycle. So where do you see this ending up, i.e., where do you see the terminal funds rate? And then how do you think we get there in terms of clip size and duration? So what is the right level of interest rates? It's a very almost philosophical question. And what I think everybody knows is that it's definitely very different than the right level of rates was some number of years ago. Pre-COVID, post-GFC. So post-GFC, that's more than a decade where we had negative real rates. Very unusual. Clearly, that's not the right level of rates anymore. You don't need to have a deleveraging happen anymore. And some of these structural spending pressures that I talked about before, whether it's businesses that need to invest for AI, or we haven't talked yet about government and all their need to do industrial policy, there's real needs to spend. So the right level interest rates, definitely not zero or negative. If you look at the Fed, the Fed thinks it's about three, made up of about two-ish percent inflation, two and change, and 75 basis points to 1% of real rate. And I think that sounds like about right, but you're not really going to know until you're really in it. And so what I think the Fed is going to do is their plan seems to be something like get to 3% at 25 basis point clips. I think that's a very reasonable plan, but if anything, the risk is that they'll need to do less than that or slower than that, that a pretty strong economy will be self-sustaining. And maybe the right neutral rate for now is 3%. Maybe it's even higher, or maybe we'll be so far into a cycle that even if the neutral rate's 3%, we'll need rates a little bit higher than that because we'll need to be a little bit quote-unquote tight, or we'll get inflation that's just a little more buoyant. And so you want to be keeping the real rate, not lower than that, a little bit under 1%. And so I think the risks are to a little bit less easing than priced in, but that 25-ish clips to get the three seems roughly right. You want to feel it out. Right. And so if I said, we think they end up around three and three-eighths come June, which will require basically 25 basis points every meeting from here to there. Does that sound about right to you? I think it's about right. As I said, I think the risk is more on the they'll do less than they'll do more, barring a very big surprise. But I think that gets them to a spot where they say, okay, now I'm sitting here, it's the middle of 2025, and my best assessment is that we're like a little tighter than neutral. How tight relative to neutral will depend on is inflation rate really a two or is it a little bit above two? That feels about right, but you could easily imagine saying, actually, we're so far into an expansion, maybe the neutral rate is three, but we should be tighter than that. We should be at four. Right. Okay. Let's pivot and speak about China for a minute. The past few weeks have seen a pretty forceful set of policy declarations and I think some high hopes within the market. How do you view these announcements? I think that the Chinese, my hope is that this is kind of their whatever it takes moment, but really more likely is that what they've really done is put down their foot and says, we're going to do whatever it takes not to crash the car. That's not the same as whatever it takes to get things to be great, but it is, we're not going to let the car crash. I think it is a fundamentally different China than it was when we saw previous rounds of stimulus, like coming out of the great financial crisis. You had this leadership that really felt that getting growth to work was the single most important goal and they would do whatever it takes to make that happen. They're not there anymore. They now believe their most important goal is fundamentally security, national security, economic security. They believe they have to gear the economy both to win against the United States and the rest of the world. It's kind of turning against it and to get over the middle income trap by having kind of the advanced technologies that you need to be productive enough. And growth is a piece and it's just a piece. You got to be tough during a war to now saying, okay, maybe this is going too far. It's getting too weak. It's too much. We can't let it get this bad. And that's a very important shift. It's very important to say, no, no, this is too much. We need to be there. We need to be stimulating. The other piece there is that they suddenly have a lot of ideological opposition to many different types of stimulus they might need, whether it is all the moral hazard issues that come with handling as tough of a deleveraging as they do or issues of stimulation where they really feel the kind of stimulation the United States did of like giving everyone a check is ideologically not okay. And so I think you're seeing a really important turning point towards experimenting with new things. It's still small experimentation, but at least they're experimenting and they're saying things like, you know, we're going to do stimulus. We're comfortable it's targeted enough. So it's targeted at poor people or it's targeted at like they have like a cash for clunkers type idea. So they're telling, you know, they're certain kind of spending they're trying to incentivize or they're targeted at people to have children. So, you know, like child credits, but they're experimenting, they're going to do things that they feel comfortable with kind of ideologically. And I think that it's a pretty good commitment to say it's gone too far. We're not going to let this car crash. How strong things will be, we'll see. What I know is deleveragings take time. Just think what it was like in Europe or in Japan. And I'd say everyone talks about Mario Draghi's whatever it takes moment. It still took a long time with a lot of ups and downs. They have a lot more to deliver to do this deleveraging well, a lot more deliver, but the confidence that there's a higher likelihood they won't let it get really bad and very deflationary is certainly higher. And does it leave you in the context of Chinese asset markets, does it leave you with any high conviction trade necessarily? Look, it's interesting across the different outcomes of the deleveraging. I think a mix of Chinese assets is incredibly well poised because pricing is just valuation on stocks is so low. There's still room to ease. There's still a lot of things policymakers can do. And you definitely have a degree of conviction that says we won't crash the car. And so I still like holding a balanced mix. I would skew more to stocks today than I would have a couple of weeks ago. But I think you're still in a spot where you basically say, look, if they disappoint somewhat, I don't think the stock market has a lot more to fall and you can still do decently in bonds or shorting the currency, holding real assets like commodities in that currency. Okay. And then sticking on the Pan-Asia front, it's been a wild ride in Japan for the past couple of months. And now we have a newly elected prime minister. How do you view the opportunity set now in Japanese asset markets? I think the bottom line is Japan is that this is an economy that has to figure out a way to tighten monetary policy. They were in a world where it made sense to have zero rates for many years. That was a long deal leveraging to work through. But you just look at the reality of the ground today and you have 2% inflation. It looks like it's relatively comfortably at 2%. You have very good labor market. You have good labor force participation. You don't need to be at these level of rates. You don't need negative 2% real rates. It just doesn't make sense. They know that. I get that there's a great fear of doing it too fast. And what happened in late July left a real scar of don't do it too fast. But obviously, part of what happened in late July, early August had a lot to do with investor positioning and so many people being positioned, having done carry trades in the end. And so while they're going to be cautious and the risk of doing it too fast is real, they're going to have to normalize policy. It just doesn't make sense to be where they are. I think the new prime minister feels it in his bones. You hear it in everything he said. He gets that. So my fair position there is definitely still being short the rates. I think that's kind of the most sensible way to be positioned in Japan. I still think the equities are moderately attractive. There's good corporate governance things that are happening there. And I think the end is roughly balanced. Okay. So you just touched on it there, but let's talk a little bit more comprehensively about the opportunity set in global currencies, which I think is a significant arrow in your quiver typically. Is this still an asset class where you have a lot of conviction? And if so, where would that be? I think it's a great asset class. It's been underutilized because it just hasn't been moving that much because you came out of COVID and the whole world was just so synchronized. So for many years, it was synchronized with zero rates and it was all synchronized, easing together, then tightening together. And finally, you're in a world where the world's not as synchronized and there's actually things going on. Inflation is different in different countries. You're getting policy normalization differently in different countries. And that's really what drives currency moves, right? You need to have differentials between countries in order to get that. Everyone being stuck at zero is zero inflation, zero rates. You're not going to get currency moves. And so I do think there are bigger alpha opportunities than there have been a long time. And it's also a really important time to kind of structurally reconsider what am I doing with currencies in my portfolio? Am I hedging my assets? Am I not? And you get to interesting conversations like, what are the structural characteristics of the dollar? Do I want to hold that as a risk-off asset? Why would that exist or not? I still think the most attractive currency is the euro because the backdrop to just the size of surplus that they have is so massive. So much money would need to circulate for the euro not to keep appreciating. And even though prospects for Europe are definitely weaker than the United States, weaker than a lot of places, that is so much in the price. And the structural surplus is so big. I still think it's the most attractive currency. And you compare that to places like Australia or Canada that have much weaker structural surpluses, deteriorating. And Canada has been weaker off the U.S. before the U.S. So you're really starting to get differentials and wide range of attractiveness. Aside from the euro, do you have a broad dollar bias? I am tilted to be somewhat bullish the dollar. The euro is more attractive than it. I think the dollar is more attractive than a lot of other currencies. You're still in a world where just most of the asset markets, financial assets are in the United States. So anybody who is saving abroad really means saving the United States. It's almost like when you buy oil, you're not thinking, I just love Saudi Arabia. You're thinking, I'm going to go whatever is at the pump. If you're buying financial assets, you're buying American assets. It's two-thirds of global market indices, et cetera. So that's a lot of structural money just gets recycled into the U.S. Almost no matter what, while the U.S. doesn't have tremendous trade deficit. And if you look at the type of protectionism that's rising and desire to close that trade deficit, especially if Trump is president, that means that you put pressure on the trade side, but you're not mitigating at all how much money wants to come into the United States. And so that just keeps pushing the dollar up. There's not a lot of choices in terms of diversification of where reserves are. And the structural properties of the dollar have proven over and over to, for I think relatively good reason, be somewhat risk reducing. So it's a lot of dollar exposure just makes sense for people to have. Okay. And then you just nodded to this, but the U.S. election is one month ahead of us. How are you thinking about the market implications? So let me start with, I don't know if unpopular, but maybe unpopular answer. I think there's more commonality than is often kind of acknowledged. In the two candidates? Yeah. I mean, in terms of market implications, first of all, you have two candidates that neither one of them really believes in closing the deficit. So neither one of them is really pushing what we need to do is go from these historical high deficit levels down. If you look at what they really want to do, yes, Kamala's plans fiscally are more for a little bit, a tiny bit of being careful on deficits. If you take her plans as literally as you can, and who knows exactly, they would end up closing I don't know, 1% of GDP a year. That's not nothing. But the makeup of that is a bunch of new spending, extending the tax credits on anybody below 400K, but also a lot of new tax credits. So things like the child tax credit, earned income tax credit, she wants to help businesses, first time homeowners, et cetera. And then on the other side, there is a desire to raise taxes to pay for some of that, whether that's raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals by not extending the tax cuts or on corporations generally raising taxes, and then some of these issues around unrealized capital gains. So you take all that and you say, yeah, you could say that's a little bit of cutting deficit. But if you look at the betting markets, I think they're realistically saying the election's 50-50, but if Kamala wins, it's much more likely she has divided government. What that means is that she's not likely to get all of that done. Much more likely, what's going to be challenging for her to get done is some of these tax raises, things that are really big breaks and what's happened before, like unrealized capital gains, very unlikely. Really actually raising taxes on corporations, less likely there'll be consensus on that. So probably if she ends up getting elected and having more of a divided Congress, she still gets something done that either keeps the deficit where it is or expands it. Trump's plans clearly wants to expand the deficit further because there's no world in which all these tariffs are enough to offset extending all of the tax cuts, maybe even reducing tax rates on corporations. So you actually have more commonality than not. Now, of course, there are differences. It does matter somewhat whether the deficit spending is going towards corporate tax cuts or lower income households. Lower income households tend to spend more in the economy, so that supports the economy more. But if you go to the business side, you are talking about something that directly supports the stock market, right? Like you're literally holding these companies that don't pay as much tax. We saw that in Trump 1. Yes, that's math. Simple math, definitely supports it. So you net those two things only say what's going to be better or worse for the stock market. It's close. It's not that far. And then if you go to things like trade and protectionism, look, no doubt Trump's rhetoric is stronger, but there's a lot of commonality. You have a lot of bipartisan consensus that China is the big strategic challenge that we need to be able to use protectionist measures. And so, yes, the Democrats are more limited. They talk about, you know, the small yard high fence, the yard is getting bigger and bigger. And a lot of consensus that we want to use industrial policy in protectionist ways because we need to do that against China. So will Trump be more aggressive than Kamala? Probably. But you're still talking about the same multi-year, multi-decade, I'd say, move that you have ahead of us away from this sort of free trade, industrial policy, bad world to one where we're putting up the walls, we're doing it in certain ways. And that's the important thing for investors. Their tail risks that, you know, Trump could really accelerate something more extreme than that. But I see more commonalities than, you know, most people talk. Sure. It's interesting because it probably would have felt like a spicy view this summer. But I think in a way the markets, judging from price action, have kind of arrived at a similar conclusion as you just asserted. And I find for all the ebb and flow in the betting markets, with the exception of a couple of very discreet things, say like green versus presumed dereg plays or whatever, the market's just kind of seemingly not had it on the front burner. I'm surprised in my client travels how little it comes up. It kind of tends to come up late as it did in this, late in the conversation. Now, who knows exactly how it feels a week or two into the binary event. But I think I share your sentiment, which is in a way the equity markets are kind of looking at the betting odds and saying, well, if the two most likely outcomes are a Republican sweep or Harris plus divided Congress, through the prism of risk, I'm okay with those outcomes. Totally. And I think that just going to how to think about risk management in these cases, there is a huge difference for investors between discreet events and kind of multi-year dynamics that end up weighing on markets. And when you have a discreet event, I think the right lens, just as you're saying is to basically say, is there something that is really like it's A or B, like Brexit is like a classic example of this. And that's mostly a risk controls issue. How do I want to protect my risk? And to have a strong view that it's a risk controls issue, like a Brexit, you need to have the market action show you that as the odds shift, something meaningful would happen if A happens versus B. For more multi-year events, these dynamics that weigh on the markets, you can't ignore them. You can't treat it as a risk control. It's going to show up in your investing in lots of different ways. And I see the same as you with what you see in the election right now, which is that discreet event is not showing up to be so big that it feels like you need massive risk controls to deal with it. I think basically no one should try to predict this election. It's probably very close to 50-50 and very few people are going to have the edge, but it doesn't seem like a very clear, okay, do X to protect your downside on what that's going to happen there. What it really highlights is just how important these big multi-year events are, which is a much bigger government role, much bigger deficit spending, more industrial policy, more protectionism. These things are going to be with us no matter who wins. Yes. Got it. I've read a lot of the work Bridgewater's authored in the past year or so on AI. So I want to talk about two items in this context. One is how do you see it impacting the economy and the labor market in some forward state? I know that is a hard exercise, but it's one you've spent a lot of time on, we've spent a lot of time on. And then the second is how do you think about expressing some of those views in the market today? Well, first thing I'll say, which I think you always have to say when you talk about AI is if you hear too much confidence, that should make you suspicious because inherently there's a lot of uncertainty. But in the near term, AI has been very inflationary pressure because of what I've talked about before, which is this desire to invest ahead of seeing any demand and all the money that's going into AI today is clearly not leading to any productivity right now, the second. But when you look ahead, I think the best analogy is really what happened in places like the United States, but particularly in the United States over the 90s, the 2000s in the manufacturing sector, where over a period of a few decades, you took something like 10% of the labor market and kind of cut it out, whether it's because you sent it to cheaper places abroad, globalization, or because automation, you actually got robots and so on to be in factory floors. So today, when you go anywhere to a manufacturing plant in the US, you see fewer workers and the workers you have left are very productive. And that 10% of the workforce that you took out, there's no one day where you said this is the market event, but over a few decades, this was a huge event that had not only social, political consequences, but it's one of the big deflationary forces that let us have the world we did in those years and really set the cost of capital, set what competitiveness was like, the level of profits. There's a decent chance that AI is at least that event again. It could be bigger. It might hit a bigger share than 10% of the workforce. It could take time more than that. It could take less time. There's a lot of arguments I can make on either side of slow or faster, but at least that template of what it means to have something like that happen that's so structural, I think is roughly the right one. And then as an investor today, I would say there's a couple of main implications I'd be looking at. One is this big question of like, when does this period of pressure on the cost of capital go up end? How big of a pressure does this come behind us to become deflationary? When does it start popping up to actually matter that this is a deflationary impact? We're not there yet, has to be watched and monitored. And one of the ways I do that really is kind of sector by sector who's incorporating it. The other is kind of not living with equity indices the way they are, because your neutral view, not knowing where AI is going to go is probably not just holding market cap the way it is. If you look at the range- Because you're going to get a huge amount of exposure and leverage to the theme, whether you want it or not. And a very particular set of exposures that may or may not be, if you start saying, what are all the ways that profitability might get created from AI? And so I'm not saying you shouldn't hold market. I'm saying at least that question should be there. And you should be saying, what is my neutral position here? And how do I want this to be set up? People also have different setups, right? Some people have lots of private exposure that has no AI in there. So when they actually step back and they say, I don't have any exposure to AI. So it's just a question that needs to be asked proactively and not just take the assumption that whatever I have in my private side has no index, whatever I have in my public side just use the index and that's it. You really want to push back against those assumptions. I agree with that. The first part, and I know you referenced this in some of your benchmark work on this, but I sometimes wonder, are we in the moment right now? Is this the happiest possible moment of the cycle in that every company is spending more and more money, which has created an incredible opportunity set in the public market that was very accessible for everyone. But we haven't rendered many, if any jobs obsolete just yet. But if you were to use that analog and if anyone grew up in the parts of the U.S. that I spend time in, which is like the Northeast, kind of a different but a traditional industrial area, all those jobs are hollowed out. And that 10% metric that you mentioned had huge societal impact in localized areas. And so if we're talking about something that could be multiples of that, you know, your mind can run pretty wild with what the forward state of that is. As you say, though, in the moment, it's very exciting. It has created an enormous amount of, I would say, home-field advantage for the U.S. We'll see how that plays out in the next phase of the game. So in early 23, you were named co-CIO alongside Bob Prince and Greg Jensen. Can you tell us a little bit about what your role involves today and how you spend your time? Well, the first thing I'll say is just you have to kind of anchor yourself to our investment philosophy, which is we are fundamental and systematic, which means that we take ideas and the kind of concepts you and I have been going back and forth on and think really hard about how to go from idea to an algorithm, a system, something that reflects the conversation we just had by writing our thoughts really rigorously that lets us both stress test the ideas, see how would they have happened through time, make sure the ideas can then be kind of looked at by other people, examined from different perspectives, and have the idea live on beyond just, you know, I had it in my head, so I put on a trade. So the role of the chief investment officers in that context is very much orchestrating that, both generating ideas, but then also working with the research teams to basically do a great job to take those ideas all the way to what it means to really bring them to life, whether that's asking tough questions about them, elevating them, and thinking what are the most important things that we're missing. And it's an incredible role because you're kind of working off of 40 years of Bridgewater history that has everything we thought of before, but trying to say, what are we missing? And like, you know, kind of how do we innovate beyond that? The other piece I would say importantly in the role is that we take really seriously being partners to our clients who are generally very large, sophisticated, institutional investors and thinking about what we truly do in their shoes. And often that means working with them to build what's the right way to use our insight given their particular circumstances. Sometimes that becomes broad strategy, sometimes not, but I think that's a really satisfying part of the role, a sense that we're kind of taking what we know about the economy and the markets and using it to really actually make a difference in how endowments are managed or pensions are managed. And with three CIOs, do you tend to split up duties in that one person, say, may kind of major more in equities and one person may major more in currencies than someone in rates? Or is that not division of labor kind of by asset class, how it works necessarily? Not necessarily. It comes and goes. I'd say that, you know, the three of us have known each other for so long, right? I've been there close to 20 years and Bob and Greg, my two co-CIOs, worked together for more than 10 years before I joined. So this is a cumulative many decades. So we know each other really well. We understand each other's strengths and weaknesses. We both like bringing in the others to look at our things. And then we like picking the things that each one of us is really going to take on our own and drive. Sometimes that really ends up down the line of an asset class or an area, but other times then you end up shifting because if you spend, you know, a decade really driving through new ideas on a certain topic, you may feel like all my ideas are already here. What I really should do is a different set of ideas somewhere else. And so it's been more fluid in that way. I'd say I have a lot of passion around this question of what's the right way to think about our partner's portfolios and what's the best way to use our insight to do that. And so I might end up taking a lead in something there because it's something where I really kind of see a path and get excited about and vice versa. Sure. And does that mean at the end of the assembly line, you have a bunch of distinct client portfolios or does it mean all of that kind of bottoms up feeds into a portfolio to serve all? So if you look at our offerings, we try not to do too much. Right. And so we have a core flagship, if you will, that's pure alpha that is just our best ideas that's intended to be uncorrelated to anything and just good, consistent, uncorrelated returns. But then there are a couple of things we do that were really designed to meet a need that is different from that. The most obvious example is if you just look at someone's portfolio and say, what's the best thing you could do for me? Your answer is probably going to say, well, what's negatively correlated? What's actually going to go directly at my biases? And so we have a few things that we're doing that are really intended to say, how do we go at your biases and poke at your biases and try to offset them, not give you just a uncorrelated, regardless of what you hold, this is the best answer. And so that is very satisfying for both sides to basically say, okay, you're with me on top of house, you're understanding my whole portfolio and you're really building the right thing. Now that ends up obviously having applicability outside because you have similarities. The broadest kind of pictures I put around that are the biggest things that drive variability in most large institutional portfolios have to do with how the economic environment is going. And one approach to that is find when in your alpha you have opposing views. For example, if you know that your stock's going to do really well if growth is strong, put on views that will do really well when growth is weak. So you end up with something kind of misshaped, but specifically shaped to fit that purpose. Another perspective is, well, can you just make investments somewhere that have different growth and inflation and monetary policies that have different exposures? So we've offered kind of packages of things like here is an Asia exposure, sometimes without China for all the challenges with China that are intended to say, again, this is misshaped, this isn't everything great in the world, but it's intended to kind of plug a hole that'll help you shift from where you're concentrated. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your life before Bridgewater. You were born and raised in Israel. You are the grandchild of Holocaust survivors. Both of your parents are professors. So can you tell us a little bit about the role your parents and your grandparents have played in shaping how you think about the world? Big question. It's a big question. You know, I'd say that the arc of my parents and grandparents' life, they saw such tremendous change, right? I remember my grandmother talking to me about the first time she saw a train and what it was for her. She was like, I saw houses moving on wheels. And the arc of her life going from literally barely running water, seeing a train being a big deal to then surviving the Holocaust and various difficult ways of surviving it and then ending her life in a world that's not that dissimilar from where you and I are today. Sure, there were no iPhones, but very similar in other ways. And it just gave me a lot of perspective about how much the world can change. Also, across these folks, they had a lot of appreciation of how lucky they were to be alive and kind of making the most out of what life has to give, whether it was obviously surviving World War II in the woods and the ways that they did, or even my father who had been in numerous wars and said to me, I didn't think I'd come out of the 1973 war alive. So I think it gives you a lot of perspective about how much the world can change, how lucky we are to be alive. And then both my professor parents had a ton of passion for what they did. I remember being a little kid, my mom would like wake up at six in the morning because she had an idea and she'd want to be writing it up and finishing a paper. And it just gave me a sense that you want to do something you feel that way about. It's a lot of what makes life worth living. And there's always going to be smart people around if you're not excited about what you're doing. It's never worth it. That's right. You attended Princeton. You studied under Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who's the author of Thinking Fast and Slow. He was your senior thesis advisor. And I think when you were at Princeton in 2002, he won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. How did your work with him influence you? Yeah, I think it's the classic, it's the beautiful thing that college campuses want to accomplish, which is that you're at the point of your life where you hear a new idea, and it actually really makes you pause and shape your thinking and see the world differently. I remember going to that first lecture that he gave and basically being really taken this idea of reflecting on decision-making and thinking about all the flaws in our decision-making and how important that is in what we do day-to-day in life, and being able to study that and actually have a perspective on that. And it connected me immediately to Bridgewater. It's the thing that immediately made me say, wow, these people are thinking really hard about making decisions well and what the human challenges are of making decisions well. I also think that Daniel Kahneman, he won the Nobel Prize because he really did create paradigm shift in economics. He thought about things that were assumptions people took for granted, people's rationality and so on from a totally different perspective, and it broke the paradigm. And being exposed to that, it does make you sit back and think a lot about what other assumptions do I have that can be broken in that way and realizing that that happens. That happens periodically, and the world and knowledge change and evolve all the time. That links back to the point you made earlier, which is we all have an anchoring bias to the present day and think the future probably won't look that much different than today. And then you flash forward 40 or 50 years, and the world looks dramatically different. I'll just say in investments, it's even more extreme because I think in investing, people are anchored to what the last couple of years' performance is like because that's kind of what they intuitively felt most recently. And what they forget is that just because that was the last few years of performance, that must mean the prices already know that and are incorporating that and tend to extrapolate the same thing will happen again, which by definition means it's harder to do next time because it's in the price. And so it's almost like you need the opposite bias of what you psychologically want to feel, which is that the past will just continue. Yes. Well said. After graduating from Princeton, so you joined Bridgewater straight away as an investment associate on the fixed income team. And then you progressed really rapidly within the company to become head of investment research, I think just seven years after joining, which is remarkable. And it made you at 31 years young, one of the highest profile women in the industry. And so I'm just kind of curious, how'd your role in managing the investment process evolve over that time? I was lucky to start at Bridgewater before the financial crisis and then get to live through those pre-financial crisis days where we were wrestling with, can this be sustainable? What do you make of how much leverage is being built up? And wrestling with that at a time where the world wasn't so concerned about it. And we felt a little bit crazy for having these views. Then living through the financial crisis, it was an amazing stress test of what we often talk about as money and credit, or the idea that literally how much money is printed and where it goes and how the debts are changing ends up being the driver of what is spent and what happens in the economy and markets. And so I kind of started as an analyst on the fixed income team and then got the experience as we got thrown into the financial crisis to really be a part of almost the SWOT team that was in a safe place. We weren't under risk kind of as a firm and really drinking from a fire hose because so many things that were theoretical, this happened in the Great Depression kind of stories were suddenly living in front of us and we got to live through those experiences and so on. And by definition, that experience was very cross-cutting because you talked about all the money and credit in the economy and where it hit and why. And so I think I came out of that well prepared to start overseeing with a wide aperture, different parts of our research process and bring new ideas in. Sure. How early into your career was 2008? Two years in. Two years in. Do you think, so I started in 1999 and then of course, 2000 hit and from March of 2000 to October of 2002, it felt like the stock market went down every day. I do think having those experiences earlier in your career is a really valuable lesson. Now, you don't want to get overly programmed to those because it's not the natural arc of the economy or the markets, but to only know up into the right early in one's career, I think can probably form other bad habits that to have some of those scars and some of those ghosts is probably not the worst thing in the early part of one's career. Totally agree. When you joined Bridgewater, you were the only woman in the investment department and you were the first female CIO at Bridgewater. You're also an active angel investor focused specifically on technology startups led by women. I'm interested in this because I co-sponsor our women's network within my division, within the global banking and markets division. And so I'm just kind of curious, how do we collectively, how do we help put more women in leadership positions within our industry? I think that is really hard to break the bias that people have, that they just sort of have an intuitive feel of what a leader should look like based on what they've seen before, because it's not mean-spirited. No one's going around being like, I just don't like X, Y, Z, women, minority. It's just that the image they have just doesn't quite line up with that. And it shows up in all these subtle ways. I got a lot of feedback in my career that was kind of circling like, you just don't feel like what an investor usually feels like to me, because the image of like the hedge fund gambler was just not what sat in front of them. And so I think that you want to take the women that you have who are capable and put them front and center partly to give people a sense that the image they have of what's required in these roles is not necessarily what the right image is. And that you kind of have to see a range. And I think often when women make it to the first-time position of leadership, they bring something a little bit different, partly because people for a while just didn't quite see that possibility, that you could kind of get that in that role. And one of the reasons you mentioned angel investing that I like doing that is I think that is particularly hard when you're talking about, say, a new company and just an idea, right? People are really going from their gut feel. So a lot of what they're imagining is, does that feel like a strong founder CEO to me? And so there's a great article from Harvard Business School about what questions women versus men founders get asked, and they get asked completely different questions. Women founders get asked a lot more about risk management and like, what if the company, this goes wrong versus vision and excitement. And so they get put, and I think it just, again, I don't think it's mean spirit at all. I just think it comes from this idea that that's just the leaders I've seen. And so you want to celebrate the cases where leaders look a little bit different, partly to change people's views about what that might look like. Well said. As I mentioned in the intro, you co-lead Bridgewater's sustainable investment efforts. How do you see these ESG factors influencing investment strategies and market dynamics in the coming years? I think we've shifted from a world where people who talked about, quote, unquote, ESG investing, were making sort of the argument that's like, oh yeah, anything more sustainable will definitely win, to where people understand this is a real factor in the world, but like any other factor in the world, whether or not it wins depends on where the world will go, where the world will prioritize these things, not what regulation will do, et cetera, and what's already priced into the markets, if that's already expected or not. And so it's a real factor in something that as an investor, you have to ask yourself that question. And it's intuitive in markets like, I don't know, commodity markets that you want to basically say, well, is there going to be an energy transition? What are my assumptions about that? Is it going to happen faster or slower than what's already expected? And that's just a thing I need to know, just like I need to know other things about how the world will evolve to have good projections. The other thing I'll say is that we've definitely gotten to the world where because a large number of investors around the world care about this topic and they want to use their capital to influence the world to move in a certain direction, particularly on climate, it is a factor that plays into decision-making. So you see it, for example, today with tech companies that they have tough choices to make if they want to kind of keep up with what they think AI, CapEx should be. They got to choose how much they care about their environmental commitments as well. And they have an ecosystem of investors, but also employees and all these things around them to tell them, well, I do actually care about how I go about AI. So having that ecosystem of investors that care about this topic has created some self-reinforcing mechanism where more players are considering that and making choices to tilt in one direction or another. Excellent. I want to ask you one last question on the formal side, then we'll have some informal questions. I'm sure people always ask you about Bridgewater's culture. What do you tell them? Honestly, what I tell them is you have to really be committed to what it's like to take hard feedback. And you have to know it's not easy, right? People like their own ideas, think they're great. You have to actually be in that spot where it can feel overwhelming. Lots of people are going to come at you and say, let me tell you all the things I like and don't like. You have to really believe that it makes you better, that it really makes you better. Because the most important thing about the culture is that we really believe in that. And so there is a requirement for people to open themselves up to that. And people will say things to you. They'll say them to you straight. You'll do something you really love. You'll have an investment idea. People will say, it's a stupid idea for these reasons. They don't hold back. And you kind of have to have the equanimity to be like, this is what makes me great, right? Like getting that feedback. At the end of the day, the market's decided if we're right or not, and so it's not about proving yourself to your colleague. We're all here to be on one team, make each other better. So you have to really be willing to be part of that. And I think once you do it, you look back and you say, man, that really made me better. All this set of feedback and whatnot. And I look back at my career and think, if these guys had held back, if they had said, well, she's new, she's young, I'm going to embarrass, she's going to be upset about this, let me really sugarcoat it. I would never have gotten as far as I did. I needed all that fuel to figure out what to do next and how to get better and find the mistakes. You need it. And just facing that criticism, does it get easier with time? You know, some elements of it are never easy, right? Nobody likes hearing feedback. I think there is a breaking point a couple of years in where people feel comfortable that this is their home, where they've had enough rounds with the other people that they're sort of in the mentality of like, we're really all on the same team here and this is meant to make me better. And that really helps. On day one, you just can't expect someone to feel that, right? Like they just walked in the door. Like how could they have that? Over time, that is a core part of what makes it is like you have the relationships with people, you know, they're really trying to push you to be great, that they want the firm to succeed. You know, that's where they're coming from. So you need to get to that spot. That takes a little bit of time. And there's no confusion about the mission. The mission is to do the best possible job by way of your clients. 100%. And not just that, there's a deep sense of insecurity and fear that if we don't do that, look, there've been tons of investment firms out there, right? Like you fail. It's just not, this is not a business for kind of resting on your laurels. We are not a toll booth, right? People will only keep coming to us if they get excellence. And so you have to have that fear that if we let it up on ourselves, if we're constantly like, ah, it's good enough that the firm just won't survive. Right. Okay. We'd like to end these sessions with a lightning round. So we're going to run through a couple of quick questions, a couple of quick answers. What's your greatest strength as an investor, Karen? I think putting lots of disparate pieces together, making connections across things and probably just curiosity. You have to be interested in the world to invest money. And is the first piece of that answer, is that just kind of the mosaic of how your mind works or the ability to put the mosaic together, I should say, or is that the systemization part of the process or is it both? I think it is the thing that made me effective in going from kind of working on one piece where, for example, you could work on the copper markets and there's a limited number of things that matter for copper and systemizing well could be a lifetime. You could spend a lifetime following that. It's a little of a different skillset to look at an entirely different market and say, you know, there's like kind of echoes of what I see in this other market that might give us insights. And I think that made me strong earlier on and kind of widening the aperture and moving between areas. But honestly, it's so hard to speak about your strength in the Bridgewater context and easier to speak about where you need to get better. And then on the point about intellectual curiosity, do you read away from work? Do you read a ton? Yes. I mean, what I honestly, I miss most since having kids, how hard it is to get time to just sit and read uninterrupted. But yeah, there's just a lot of things that don't directly, super directly relate to literally my job where I can't make a linear connection of I should read this because this will affect what I'm doing in the market, but that I'm curious about and I get interested in. And then some period later starts really connecting for me. And similarly with markets, you kind of have to pick up and read and think about things that aren't like literally your priorities tomorrow to have ideas. Sure. Yeah. I always find an issue when you're reading something which may be far afield from what we do, but your mind stumbles into something more related to what we do do. I won't have it off the top of my head, but there is some quote from Churchill. He read a lot, including during the war, and then kind of said like, we have a job to do. How do you have this time? He said, because my reading time is my thinking time. I think there's huge value again, in terms of how you do connect back to work, even if the subject matter is not entirely germane to what we do day to day. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? I think I would say from Ray Dalio, our founder, early on in my career, he sort of said, look, you're overly trained the way a lot of college kids are trained, which is to answer questions based on the information you know is available to answer questions. You write book reports, you write papers. And actually often the right thing to do is just ask the right question and realize you don't have the data to answer it. You have no idea how to answer it and just sit and wrestle with the fact that that's the important question and you don't know how to answer it versus being drawn to where there is a question that you know how to answer because the data is there and you see the path on the analysis. I think that was probably the best advice. That's super interesting. Which investor do you admire most? I'm going to give you a little bit of a counterintuitive answer, I think, which is when you look at the largest institutional investors out there, there are a few of them. I'll name GIC in Singapore, CPP in Canada, Future Fund Australia. It's a different kind of investing than we do, right? But they've really admirably broken the box of kind of what was expected, what people thought was the right way to think about things, whether it is not being stuck with market cap, not being stuck with asset classes, thinking of their goals in a different way, in an environment that's very different than Bridgewater, right? Different set of stakeholders, different governance. But I really admire that because at the end of the day, what we do feeds in like the whole point of investing money is making wealth for the next generation. And these big institutions are the ones at the forefront of actually delivering that. So I really admire being able to really think creatively how to do that in the best way. That's a great answer. How do you spend your time outside the office? Mostly with my kids. I have two young girls, three and a half, one and a half, and it is just joyous. And then finally, what are you most excited about in the world right now? It is a really great time to be doing what we're doing because back to that curiosity point, there's just so many things happening that feel unprecedented and different. And so honestly, I feel lucky every day that thinking about those things and reading about those things and reflecting on those things is actually my job and not just what I choose to do on my own spare time. Sure. So if you look at, we talked a little bit how AI is going to evolve. I mean, like what could be more interesting than figuring that out? This might be the biggest event in the next couple of decades. Clearly, geopolitical tensions constantly feel like at the edge of a knife, and it feels more like known unknown than unknown unknowns. Meaning we know that there's a lot of dissatisfaction. We see incumbents being voted out everywhere. We see all these pressures building up. Where are they actually going to go? Where are they going to build up to? And so being in a world where you can kind of take what everyone I'd say broadly agrees, which is we're in a different secular paradigm than we have been, but getting to actually break that down to what's this literally going to mean and when, very excited about that. I agree. I was thinking about this the other day, which is, it's always interesting in the markets and there's always things to work on. But if I think about the current environment, the past several years, called the COVID post-COVID environment, and I compare that to the period, the kind of secular stagnation, new normal. So let's call it the post-Lehman pre-COVID period. Not that things didn't happen. We had a European crisis. We had an oil and gas boom and bust. Huge parts of what we're seeing blossom today were born in that era. But there were some very lean years, low velocity, low interest rate, low volatility. I don't think people necessarily, the younger, if you will, the younger generation probably appreciates how good and interesting things have been of late and hopefully will continue to be relative to the cycle that preceded us. Totally. May we live in interesting times. Bingo. Karen, thank you for doing this. Much appreciated. Thanks for having me.

These often attempt to perform as well or even better than their benchmarks, while also having a positive impact on the world. But is it actually possible to do both? Just because a company decides to invest more dollars towards sustainable goals, that's not automatically going to be appreciated by the investment community. The returns matter as well. I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. Today, I'm sitting down with Goldman Sachs' Brian Singer, the global head of GS Sustained within Goldman Sachs Research, and Greg Schell, head of the inclusive growth strategy within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Brian, Greg, welcome to the program. A pleasure. Thank you. So, Brian, you've covered the natural resources sector at GS for more than two decades. For those who don't know, and Greg, I'm not sure you know this, Brian and I actually started in the same GS analyst class many, many moons ago. Many moons. And we worked closely together because I was in commodities in the first half of my career, commodities research. You were covering the oil and gas sectors. So clearly we had a lot of interaction and we go way back. But you now lead the firm's research around sustainability and impact investing. So what motivated you to shift into covering that space after covering traditional energy for so long? I loved covering energy and I still like looking at the energy sector. The energy sector is going to play an important role in everyday life, and it's going to play an important role towards sustainable goals. The opportunity for learning and creating new lanes for sustainable investing and sustainable investors is really what attracted me to GS Sustained. And then additionally, in some of the experiences that I had covering energy, it seemed often that there needed to be more conversations between various constituents important to energy development, whether that was companies, investors, policymakers, other stakeholders. And so I think really trying to put together thoughtful research on how we as a society can try to drive sufficient supply, transition, affordability, reliability, and security. We think that's critical to achieving both environmental and social related sustainable goals. Additionally, some of the frameworks that are important to energy of looking at cyclical sectors, but finding secular trends that absolutely applies to sustainability as well. And so we continue to have a lot of conversations about energy and the energy sector. And so it's great being a part of both worlds. And Greg, let me turn to you. I mentioned you run the inclusive growth strategy for Goldman Sachs asset management, but there are lots of styles of investing out there. So when did you decide that sustainable and impact investing is what you wanted to focus on in your career? Yeah, thank you, Allison. So I have a unique background in the sense that I have been an investment professional for a really long time, more than 25 years now. And I'm a capitalist and I believe deeply in capitalism's ability to transform sectors and industries through innovation. It also, I think, has a proven track record at being able to deliver wealth and to lift people out of poverty. I've always believed that, I still do. At the same time, Allison and I have been really intimately familiar with all the ways that capitalism doesn't always get it quite right. And we see enormous disruptions in the economy that have delivered really uneven outcomes in the society that we live in, the likes of which are not just important to study and understand, but they've become actually self-reinforcing. And that's not the way we want the economy to be run. We actually want the creative disruption that allows for equal opportunity irrespective of their outcomes. That's actually not what we see today. And so there is a really significant part of my background that has been spent in the not-for-profit and civic world, where I think you got to see the other side of the economy and deep pockets of need, intractable issues that aren't likely to get solved with the current methodologies. And I, with respect to entering the impact investing ecosystem, really used to say that this was the first time when I came to this ecosystem that the two sides of my brain have ever met each other. And so I really have been able to marry what is real intentional usage of private capital and all of its prerogatives to deliver solutions and innovation in pockets of the economy that vitally need it. SONIA DARA Well, I do want to get into that more. But before we do, I just kind of want to cut to the chase for a moment. And let me just ask the big question that I have, and I think a lot of people have, which is this idea that impact investing to a lot of people really feels like more of a branding or a marketing tool, rather than anything real. Is there much more to it than that? DAVID ROBERTS Yeah, I'm happy to take that first. I'm going to follow you in there, Alison, and say that in many ways, the purposeful act of using private capital to address a big challenge should be pretty intuitive. At the same time, impact investors have at some level been held back by any number of acronyms and branding and so on. I acknowledge that. At the same time, I think that part of the conversation is probably best had in conferences and in the white paper crowd. When you look out the window and you observe what are the five or so most important trends where there's secular growth, big, enormous addressable markets, and real money to be made, they're going to feed back out things like technological disruption or AI. You're going to feed up decarbonization in energy transition. You're going to think about things like inequality. You're going to think about things like the future of work and the ability for much of our population, especially low and middle skilled laborers, to be able to hook onto the mainstream economy. And when you get our investment opportunities that are likely to be pretty opportune for a decade or more, and that's what I like talking about. And if that label comes along with being thought of as one thing or another, I'm accepting of that. But I think that this is incredibly on trend for where investment capital is already going, irrespective of branding. And I think this will be in the future what good investing looks like to us and to everyone. And so all that said, I mean, when I still think about impact investing, I think about having a positive impact for the world. And ultimately, that is a key part of the mission that you have described. But I think the key question is always, you know, does that come at some kind of compromise or sacrifice for returns from an investment perspective? You just said these trends that all investors are really trying to, I think, embrace are a key driver of impact investing. But again, is there any type of compromise from that perspective, Brian? Yeah, there should not be a compromise. There doesn't need to be a compromise. And in fact, when we look out there and we look more through the lens of public investing and opportunities, there are plenty of companies out there that have good return on capital, above average return on capital that would meet various and advance various sustainable goals or have impact. So we very much prefer, and GS Sustain has long advised, a concentric circles approach of let's look for companies that have good financial fundamentals. And then let's look for companies that fit the mold of a given sustainable or impact-oriented theme. And let's find who are the companies that are inside both circles. Now, there are a lot of buzzwords within sustainable and impact investing, usually as it relates to themes, net zero, circular economy, biodiversity. But when push comes to shove, we're talking about themes that we think transcend sustainable investing and frankly, are part of normal investing or would apply to generalist investing as well. Innovation, efficiency, resilience, productivity. Those are essentially the same ideas that can advance these sustainable goals and also where we think you can find returns-enhancing opportunities. So let's talk about those returns-enhancing opportunities a little bit more. Greg, you mentioned that there are a lot of opportunities today. Give us some specific examples of what impact investors are focused on right now. Yeah, happy to. I think one of the big twin tenets that impact investors think about is the opportunity to deliver capital according to intentionality and additionality. And the idea is that it's a purposeful act to look for these opportunities, exactly as Brian has mentioned, to deliver innovation and productivity and to really help blunt the effects that we know to be the case around many disruptive forces in the economy. And once there, and this is where I think impact investors really do set a tone and establish a real leadership position, is that from there, it's really about adding something to it. The capital is one part of the equation, but the ability to measure, for example, or to convene talent or any number of other ways that are both return-enhancing, but they're also methods by which companies are supposed to be able to better and more effectively do the things that they want to do. There's actually a value-added kit. This is especially true in the private markets, Allison, but that additionality piece is really important to impact investors. And really the theme here is that no economy can truly be truly sustainable if everybody doesn't find their way into it. So we focus on three big industry verticals. Healthcare is one. We know for so many reasons why there's unequal access to care. We think a lot about education, workforce development, and the future of work. We live in times of crisis with respect to our public schools. Fixing that obviously makes our country and economy more competitive. We think a lot about how many people are either over-reliant on the gig economy or are barely employable, don't have the skills to offer the economy, which as we're experiencing it, become much more about skilled labor and opportunities to participate the kinds of growthy parts of the economy that are short the number of laborers that they need. It's deeply intuitive to me why that is not only a really good thing to do for the economy, but really commercial. And the last thing is with respect to financial inclusion and allowing more people to participate in traditional products like retirement or savings or investment, but also really delves into things like credit repair or earned wage access and removing real points of friction so that people can play the roles in the economy that they're capable of. So taken together, big market opportunities, really nice businesses, almost all of them are service businesses, tech-enabled, high margin, generate a lot of cash. That sounds like a pretty good investment formula to me. So there's no reason to contemplate why doing that should make you invest at any less than a market rate of return. I actually think, Allison, that it's more true that it's the opposite, which is this is actually more opportune and a really nice place to be if you're focused on and have the right tools to add value to the companies you want to support. So just to be perfectly clear on the nuts and bolts, your investment strategy focuses on companies, mostly private companies aligned with those strategies you just talked about. Yeah. So this would be mostly a buyout-oriented strategy where we'll do control deals, Allison, with some of what we do will be growth equity investing. So all private capital, really writing 50 to $150 million equity checks along the meridian of those key themes that I mentioned and really working hard to try to accelerate the businesses to help them deliver more solutions and more innovation and, frankly, more scale as they go about addressing some of these big challenges that we're going after. And so when we put this all together, how do we really evaluate, Brian, the success of these types of investments or, Greg, your type of fund? Is it measured just in returns like any other investment or is there something that captures that intangible positive that they are providing to society? Sure. So there's probably some bottoms-up ways and top-down ways where we can look at this. First, we can try to group companies into who are the companies that are adopters versus who are the companies that are enablers. The companies that are enablers are really helping with their products, others downstream or customers or individuals to try to accomplish sustainable goals through their products. The adopters are ones that are trying to do it for themselves. For the enablers, it's often more easily measured through a combination of earnings and then what is the product helping to enable. So if it's something that is helping to avoid emissions, we can try to measure what that is. But there's at least a revenue stream and that can translate to an earning stream or a return on capital stream. For those that are more of the adopters, then oftentimes if it's not a business, there needs to be some other metric to look at. Is the company reducing its own emissions intensity? Is it something where they're doing something on the social side where their human capital type metrics are improving? Is there a water or other consumption efficiency improvement that is being seen at the corporate level where one can measure that impact? And I think those are ways of trying to do it on more of an individual basis. From a top-down basis, there is a lot of capital that needs to be invested towards goals like decarbonization, infrastructure, clean water. We estimate about $6 trillion annually is needed, which would be about a $2.8 trillion run rate increase from the annual run rate in 2015 to 2020. We can try to measure based on trends in corporate CapEx and R&D, as well as estimates for what that green mix shift is, how much of that's on track. I mean, we can see that the private sector, A, is making a significant increase in those investments, while B, it doesn't actually look like we're entirely on track when we add it all up. But we can also look at where there's spare capacity. Where can the private sector actually be doing more? Where could publicly traded companies be doing more based on their free cash flow and balance sheet capacity? We actually think there's about $700 billion of spare capacity for additional green investment that public companies could be making. But going back to the points that we were talking about earlier and that Greg was mentioning, just because a company decides to invest more dollars towards sustainable goals, that's not automatically going to be appreciated by the investment community. The returns matter as well. And so there's, I think, a burden both in terms of having capital and access to capital, and also demonstrating that this is something that is not only impactful in the ways you're asking, but it can also be enhancing from a return perspective. It sounds to me like the industry is feeling its way through really understanding how to measure returns in this space. Does that seem right to you? And if that's really the case, are investors grappling with that? Or have they embraced that at this point, that uncertainty in terms of measurement? So on our end, we have gotten a lot more questions over the last six months on the linkages to stock performance among various sustainable strategies. And I think that makes sense in the context of some of the volatility that we've seen in broader markets and some of the uncertainty from an interest rate and geopolitics perspective. We think that it's super healthy. We think there's a move by investors to really focus on metrics that matter in terms of how to look at companies and how to measure that impact on fusing the financial fundamentals, as we talked about, in with sustainable metrics. And we think it'll actually end up putting sustainable investing in a better place. And so, Greg, if we take a step back and think about these impact investments and these ESG investments and the role that they play in investors' portfolios, how do you define that role? And is it differentiated from other asset classes? Yeah, Alison, I love this question because as somebody who deeply appreciates how challenging it is to deliver premium returns to investors, it's just an important question for us all to address. It is exactly what you would want it to be, which is a specialized investment thesis designed to produce premium returns and find its way into diversified portfolios as a source of alpha. I think today what's interesting is that you can buy cheap beta across asset classes and then have your opportunities to carve out really interesting managers who are delivering real expertise based on the kinds of markets that they cover. There are companies that are behaving in ways that are uniquely accessible to investors who think and act and have built a fund around the ability to support companies who are doing some key things out in the economy. When all those things come together, premium returns aren't just possible, but they actually become more probable for your ability to have built that than if you didn't. But correct me if I'm wrong, impact investing doesn't have a long track record. When you mentioned the diversification benefits, for example, is that what we actually see? Is diversification benefits coming from impact investing funds or do we have enough data to make the determination at this point? You know what's fascinating about your question, the length of the track record or the depth of the data set has not stopped people from drawing a whole bunch of conclusions. I think the data set is robust enough to say the following. There is no reason to believe that sort of a priori impact investors are delivering a concessionary return. I think we know that is not what the empirical evidence teaches us. I think it's also true that the big secular growth trends that we think matter most are well-represented, and Brian covered some of them with respect to energy transition, whether it's zero economy or waste or recycling or biodiversity or food safety or food waste. These are really big, interesting markets to go after. So there is an investment response to that. So I think we can say those things with deep clarity. But you're not wrong. We will need many years and funds worth of additional data to make stronger inferences than that. The idea that data is all that matters, it's an intriguing concept because if that were true, there'd be some different points of sentiment and point of view around this. And the resistance that we've seen is quite separate from the data that we see. So longer track record, more tenure needed, but encouraging results so far. So last question for both of you. If we sit down again in 20 years and look back on this conversation, what will have changed? Do you think impact investing will be seen as it is today, as this separate track, another way to think about how we make our investments? Or will it just be part of the process we go through, the natural process, before we make a fundamental investment? Brian, you first. I think it will still be a very important part of the overall investment process because when looking at any company in any space, it is what is the value of their product? What is the long-term value of the product? What is the impact on the near term in terms of returns? And so we think impact is going to continue to play a major role. Also, there are a lot of sustainable goals that are out there and it's going to require a lot of capital. And frankly, one of the areas I think that is more front and center right now is what are the implications if we actually have insufficient amounts of capital that are invested? The fact that we actually are not awash in green CapEx actually becomes more of an opportunity because if we were seeing too much, then we would be oversupplied when we're not. So there's a little bit of a glass half empty, glass half full way of looking at this. The investment opportunities actually remain robust because we're actually not oversupplied with green CapEx, but that still will leave a lot of opportunity for investment down the road. Greg, how do you think things evolve from here? What I would anticipate, Alison, is that in the future, I would like to believe that the impact investors would have helped catalyze some key questions, including what is the proper role of business in society? And I think we would also be credited, I hope, with pointing out that, hey, we've lived really over the last 15 or so years, certainly since the financial crisis, in an era of stimulus. And one of the reasons why is because the real economy continues to suffer from some real points of real decay. I think we have witnessed really a full breakdown of social mobility where a person's life chances can be easily predicted by the zip code that they're born in. Capitalism is not supposed to work like that. It's not supposed to be self-reinforcing. And I know to a lot of people who are maybe not as deeply steeped in some of the points of view as maybe I or other impact investors would be, but I would actually say it's us who are sounding the rallying call for the power of the private sector and its ability to deliver solutions. And it's supposed to be dynamic, right? We've not seen that in the deepest parts of the economy. So as a friend of mine and former colleague has said, and I like to use this, but I do attribute it to him, impact investing is where capitalists go to fix capitalism. And when I first heard that, it really rang true to me. And first, in order to deliver real solutions, you got to have a sensibility that something's not quite right. And in some places, it's even broken. And so that's what this is all about. It is the opportunity to deliver premium returns by seeking out big parts of the economy that really need some adjusting. And when you have that going for you, really good things are possible, both for the kinds of impact and after effects that you hope to have, but especially the commercial rates of return that you can drive with that as your guiding light. Thank you so much, Greg and Brian, for a fascinating conversation. I mean, what I took from this is we need to unleash the private sector on our biggest problems, but there are returns to help make that happen, to motivate that and also do something good for society along the way. It's wonderfully said. Absolutely. Thanks for having us. Thank you. This episode of Goldman Sachs Exchanges was recorded on Tuesday, April 16th, 2024. I'm your host, Alison Nathan.

\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## 2022-07-19 12:00:00+00:00\n==================================================\n\n### How Companies are Navigating the Energy Transition\n**Episode ID:** 4688\n**Transcribed:** 2025-07-29 22:23:02\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\nFrom geopolitical tensions, surging gas prices, and energy shortages, how are major companies dealing with the energy transition? It's really a trilemma in terms of how do we deliver cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy. Now, that requires trillions of investments in terms of getting there because it's a fundamental rewiring of the entire energy system. I'm Alison Nathan, and this is Exchanges at Goldman Sachs. To help us break down the energy shift and big oil's push into a more sustainable future, Julia Kirchia, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Ventures at BP, and Michele Della Vigna, Head of Natural Resources Research in EMEA for Goldman Sachs' research, join us now. Michele, Julia, welcome to the program. Thank you. Thank you, Alison. So, Michele, let's start with you. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is obviously forcing countries to make some really tough choices about how to fuel their economies. So how have these developments changed the landscape for energy investments over the last few months? I think it's a complete turning point after seven years of structural underinvestment. Let me put a couple of numbers to it. If we take all of the investments in primary energy, so not just oil and gas, but also solar, wind, nuclear, bioenergy, we sum it all up. We used to spend about $1.5 trillion per annum up until 2014. And since then, that investment has started to decline, reaching a trough of only $1 trillion in the last couple of years. We believe that investments need to rise again at least to $1.5 trillion, more likely to $2 trillion if we also want to reach net zero carbon by 2050. And finally, after this conflict, the world, the government, but also investors are starting to realize that this underinvestment in energy is unsustainable and hurtful to society. And we think it's really signaling this turning point from effectively a 10% negative decline in energy investment from the last seven years to what we believe should be a 15 to 20% per annum growth looking forward. And Giulia, we are having this war in Ukraine. We are obviously facing inflationary pressures around the world, and there's a lot of pressures to decarbonize, as Michele just outlined. So walk us through the forces that integrated energy players like BP are contending with. How are you dealing with all of these challenges? Yes. So I think it's fair to describe it as an exceptional confluence, I would say, of four challenges. The first one is unfortunately, obviously, the human tragedy and the war in Ukraine with so many lives impacted, and also with impacts in terms of global food supply chains. The second one is very much around the energy crisis. So Michele gave some numbers. We just published our stats review. And what we're seeing happening is this on one side, demand rebounding post-pandemic. So in 2021, we've seen primary energy consumption actually grow to be 1% higher than what it used to be in 2019. So on one side, we have energy demand growing. And the other side, we have supply constraints. And Michele talked to the supply constraint driven by past investment. But of course, Russia also plays a critical role. In 2021, Russia produced 10.5 million barrels a day of oil and was the largest global exporter. The IEA estimates that approximately 3 million barrels a day of that production is actually offline today due to sanctions. You take gas, Russia was supplying in 2021, 32% of European gas and 55% in Germany. If you look at midstream one last week, volumes decreased by 60%. So that creates a fundamental pressure that brings into the equation security of supply. The third key challenge is climate. So a lot of commitment, a lot of ambition, and yet if you look at 2021, emissions again have risen by 5.7% in our stats review, which basically means a rebound from the 2020 dip, which was linked to lockdowns. And then the fourth one is the societal crisis in terms of increasing cost of living, inflation, and lower economic growth and, you know, potential implications in terms of recession. So it creates an extremely uncertain environment to navigate both in terms of macroeconomic environments as well as energy. We're very different stances in different geographies, so Europe seeing it as an opportunity to accelerate because the levers for the energy transition basically play into security of supply and independence from Russia, other regions playing it very differently. For us, it's just a re-statement of our strategy and what we need to do, which is basically do the right thing and do the right thing was really at the core of our decision to exit Russia, continue to invest in our resilient hydrocarbons business to supply the oil and gas that the world so needs today and making that business resilient and accelerating and continuing to invest in our transition growth engines to build the alternative and capture that growth. And in many ways, you're really just seeing your customer base change in terms of their urgency and need to diversify energy resources away from traditional hydrocarbons, again, given this push towards decarbonization and focus on climate change mitigation. So how has that impacted your strategy? Well, it's very much the prerogative of actually getting to net zero. If you think about it, it's really a trilemma in terms of how do we deliver cleaner, reliable and affordable energy now that requires, as Michela was saying, trillions of investments in terms of getting there because it's a fundamental rewiring of the entire energy system. And I don't know how it's going to play out in terms of pathway, but there's a few truths that we know will play out. First one is in the energy demand mix, we'll see fossil fuels over time decreasing. So if you take Paris Line scenarios, we're talking about 25 to 50 million barrels a day in 2050 versus 100 today. So there still is oil in the system, but less gas is more resilient. Electrification doubles to 2050 with renewables, if we are to get to net zero, basically having to grow to approximately 600 to 750 gigawatts a year developed. That's three times, two to three times what we did in 2021. And for hard to abate sectors, which are sectors where we can't electrify, and that's one third of energy demand today, we will need hydrogen, bioenergy and CCS to actually play a role. So as you can imagine, it creates a huge opportunity for us. And that's really at the core of what we've done from a strategy standpoint in setting an ambition to net zero and setting mid, long term, medium term targets to get there, covering scope one, scope two and scope three, and a three piece strategy with hydrocarbons, mobility and convenience and low carbon. And we're in action. So a week ago, we announced the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which has the potential to actually become one of the largest global hydrogen hubs. So we've acquired a 40 percent stake in it and operatorship. And you're talking about 26, up to 26 gigawatts of renewable capacity developed, 1.6 million tons of hydrogen produced or 9 million tons of ammonia. This is big and is a clear indication of our willingness, but also the acceleration in the system towards energy transition. And Michele, if we think back, one of the key hindrances of embedding more renewables into the system, as Julie just laid out, we have to do in order to transition in the way that we desire has just been the cost. The cost and returns environments of renewables. So is that changing? Are we moving more towards an environment in which renewables are offering better returns? I think higher hydrocarbon prices are a driver of decarbonisation because renewables become more attractive in an environment of high electricity prices. Until a few months ago, we were looking at purchasing agreement of renewables, which kept going lower and lower and lower, really challenging the economics there. And there was this view that returns would only fall in renewables. I think this energy crisis has many negative consequences, as Julia highlighted. But if we want to look for the silver lining, it does make these low carbon technologies more attractive. Certainly renewables with much better purchasing agreement looking forward, but also technologies that looked incredibly marginal, like green hydrogen until recently from an economic perspective, are actually in the money today in Europe because of the extremely high gas prices. And this is certainly an angle that we need to think about. And if there is one positive consequence from this energy crisis, it is, we believe, the acceleration of some of these low carbon technologies. But it's interesting you say that, Michele, because ultimately that's on a relative basis, right? So they look more attractive because hydrocarbon prices are higher, not necessarily because the costs are coming down for renewables. Or are they? Is that part of the equation here as well? I think we have a long track record of some of these low carbon technologies being deflationary. We've seen it over a decade for solar and wind, but they certainly are not deflationary today. They are suffering from the tightness in the global supply chain as so many other parts of the industrial sector. And we're seeing somewhere between a 10% and a 40% increase in pricing across solar, wind, and batteries. We believe it's temporary. We believe development in scale of these technologies will ultimately bring their costs lower. But there is no doubt that right now we are into an inflationary phase. And one area that you are focused on and have been for some time is actually hydrogen. The hydrogen investing landscape has been gaining momentum, but you see more momentum ahead. So can you talk a little bit about the role that the hydrogen that Giulia mentioned might play in this transition? Absolutely. Giulia mentioned it as one of the key drivers of decarbonization, but also of low carbon growth for the big oil companies as they become big energy companies. And there's no doubt that when we look at our carbonomics cost curve, actually hydrogen is the key decarbonization technology for a lot of the harder to evade sectors, especially heavy transport and heavy industry. And that's why we've always estimated hydrogen would ultimately need to drive between 10 and 15% of global decarbonization, unlocking at least $5 trillion of investment over the next three decades. But I think the recent energy crisis has added extra urgency because if Europe wants to substitute Russian gas, which is mainly consumed in winter with renewables, which are mostly produced in summer, the only way we can bridge this seasonality issue is through hydrogen. And that's why we believe a development in large scale of green hydrogen in Europe will be a great way to turbocharge the development of renewable power without suffering from seasonality problems. But I also pass it on to Giulia because clearly her company is one of the most active in this area. Yeah, Michele, I totally agree. I think we see hydrogen playing a critical role with the same order of magnitude in terms of primary energy demand share. I think definitely towards hard to evade sectors, including, by the way, on the longer term, aviation and e-fuels. We see the same acceleration coming in, powered in particular by Repower Europe and that confluence of hydrogen being one of the critical drivers to actually reduce reliance on import of gas. We also see, interestingly, an acceleration in terms of demand, customers actually also from other regions. And I think similarly, prices might play a critical role in terms of being in the money or not, but actually asking already for green or blue hydrogen supply. I think in terms of map, we see a world where we see local hydrogen production for local demand, but increasingly also an international hub play where you're basically going to look for where's my cheapest resource? And that could be Australia, Middle East countries in Africa, such as Mauritania. And then obviously the challenge that we need to crack is how do we effectively transport it to the demand centers in Europe and Asia? But yes, we see it playing a critical role. And I think, as you mentioned, Michele, it is complex, large scale projects. It is difficult and dangerous to transport. It requires significant conversion capabilities and shipping capabilities if you actually want to move it. And gas customers are likely to transition to hydrogen. So for us, it is a perfect play in terms of our role in decarbonization. One thing I would mention, Alison, to what you were saying is this is also why we see renewables playing a role, but not only as renewables standalone, but also renewables integrated into hydrogen. So when we look at renewables as a critical piece of the equation, we're not only looking at renewables with its return, but we're looking at renewables as part of integrated plays, be it into EV, be it into trade and power, or be it into hydrogen, which actually changes pretty fundamentally the economics. Right. As we talk towards these goals of moving towards net zero, and BP has actually been quite specific about this. I think you've announced or put out an update in February that basically said net zero across your operations and production and sales by 2050, and then an interim goal of 2030. But ultimately, if you look at some of the reports from the IEA and the IPCC, the efforts that BP and the broader industry and the broader world are making still seem to be falling short of keeping that global warming at an acceptable level. So I guess my question to you is, BP doing enough? Is the industry more broadly doing enough? How would you respond to that? Yeah, so I think what I would say, Alison, is we've built everything around scenarios. And if you look at scenarios and the sources that we work with in terms of more tolerative scenarios are the IEA and the IPCC scenarios. Now if you look at those April scenarios from the IPCC, which are the last scenarios, including the 1.5 degree scenarios, the 43%, which is referred to, is a global average. Now what we can't do is take that 43% and bridge it into a specific energy source for an industry. If you look at the breakdown of that number, what you actually start seeing is primary energy consumption from oil is set to decline from 2019 to 2030 by 10%. Primary energy consumption from gas declines again 10% from 2019 to 2030. Primary energy consumption from coal declined by 75% from 2019 to 2030. So what we have done is we've actually looked at the scenarios on a pretty granular level and we've extracted the elements which are relevant and pertinent to our asset base because we don't have coal generation assets in our portfolio. And so on that basis, we've defined our aims, which indeed, as you described, are net zero across operations, production and sales. And I think we're one of the only oil and gas players who has actually net zero aims across the entire supply chain or value chain. And we think they're aligned to Paris. They're based on aligned to Paris scenarios. They get to net zero across all the dimensions and they're based on a corridor of scenarios in terms of 2025 and 2030 interim targets. But at the same time, as we've discussed in this conversation a few times, oil markets are tight, global energy markets are very tight right now, natural gas prices are skyrocketing. Does it make sense to really stick to these targets? I mean, in other words, is BP doing the right thing, but just too early, given the current context? If I, and that's a question we get pretty often, as you can imagine, but in the current context, if I look at it, our strategy is a strategy of diversification in the frame of an energy transition, which will happen. We don't know at what pace that energy transition will happen, but it is happening. So it's a strategy of diversification on one side. And secondly, it's a strategy of growth to be exposed to those transition growth sectors and be in a place where we can capture them. So our strategy is set to optimize that, and it's not changing, given the context that we're navigating today. It is a strategy of growth. We've set an ambition to actually grow EBITDA from 37 billion to approximately 41 to 48 by 2030. And yes, you know, high oil prices are actually making it easier to transition, but we didn't develop the strategy assuming high oil prices, as you can imagine, we developed it across a range of scenarios. And the strategy is very much built on two pillars. On one side, it's continuing to invest on the resilient hydrocarbons piece, and we're talking about 9 to 10 billion in 2025 in terms of investment, going to 8 billion in 2030. And we're talking about continuing to provide the oil and gas the world needs even more than before today. We have announced that we will be reducing our portfolio by 40% by 2030, but we've also announced that we aim to keep it flat by basically focusing on the best barrel. So to your question, what we are doing is we're focusing on the highest margins, lower carbon, to make sure that the oil and gas we produce on a long term basis can actually be resilient through the energy transition. At the same time, we are investing in growth, and those transition growth engines, basically 6 billion in 2025, and that number grows to approximately 7 to 8 billion in 2030. And those are transition growth engines, which are likely to grow whichever scenario we're in. We're talking about bioenergy, where if anything, the limitation is going to be supply. We're talking about EV mobility, which is happening twice faster than what we expected even in our net zero scenario a year ago. We're talking about convenience, which for us is related to EV mobility. We're talking about renewables, and I shared some of the numbers in terms of acceleration. And we're talking about hydrogen, which is a critical building block for hard to abate sectors. So the way I look at it is you're exposed to the short term upside, and you continue to provide oil and gas to an energy system, which today let's face it is very reliant on oil and gas, but you're positioning yourself to capture the growth that will inevitably come through the energy transition. And Michele, you have been banging the drum for a long time about the underinvestment in hydrocarbons and how painful that could be in the near term as we are undergoing this transition. So do you see the industry responding? Do you think there are now opportunities given the current price environment, high price environment that we expect to be sustained? Or how do you see this impacting how much money goes into the core hydrocarbons? I think the industry is starting to respond. We are starting to see it in short cycle developments, which have a payback of two to three years. We're seeing it in U.S. shale. We're seeing it in parts of the Middle East. I think where we're not seeing it yet in the scale we need is in the longer cycle, longer payback oil developments and in natural gas. One argument we've always supported is that natural gas is a key green transition fuel. It's needed for the next 10 to 20 years as a minimum to move away as fast as possible from coal and from fuel oil that generate two times the CO2 emission per unit of energy than natural gas. And I think the problem that we've seen until now, especially in Europe, is that there's been a movement against all hydrocarbons without the distinction of where they sit in terms of the carbon intensity curve. And we believe we need to reevaluate natural gas as a transition fuel and really turbocharge the growth of liquefied natural gas as a key way to continue to support not only decarbonization in emerging markets where affordable energy is key to move away faster from coal, but also energy security in Europe and the more rapid move away from Russian gas, which will be impossible and unaffordable unless we start to develop more LNG projects globally. There's such a stigma around investing in fossil fuels, but is that the way to do it without conflicting with ESG goals, focusing on natural gas, which is a cleaner energy or for companies out there that are focused on making sure we have sufficient hydrocarbons, but don't want to conflict with ESG goals? What is the right way to do that? In attempt to answer, and then I'm sure Giulia has a lot more to add, I believe as long as we need hydrocarbons from a consumption perspective, and we think that is the case, definitely for oil with growth until the middle, if not the end of the decade, and for gas growth probably until the end of the next decade, I think the key is to produce them with lower emissions, lower so-called scope one and two emissions. I think it's important, first of all, to develop oil and gas with less flaring, less methane venting, and less emission across the supply chain, and then to add lower carbon sources of energy like renewables and hydrogen, and make sure that while producing a higher amount of energy, we can do it with lower emissions, and so better operations end in the beginning of a diversification of energy sources towards low carbon. That I think is what energy companies can do to be consistent with the future where there is more affordable energy for a growing world population, but we also address some of the challenges of climate change. But Giulia, I'm sure you have a lot more to add on that. I fundamentally agree. As you know, we're in action on methane emissions, and if I can react to the point in terms of changing the energy mix, there's a number which I find quite telling, which is if you take India and you project energy demand in India, which is projected to grow exponentially over the next 30 years, if that growth, instead of being actually generated through coal-fired power plants, were actually supplied through combined cycle, g-gas, you would actually reduce emissions by two gigatons. Now, to give a sense of the order of magnitude we're talking about, the amount of emissions last year in India is approximately the same amount. So it gives you an order of magnitude of the impact that the shift from coal to gas can actually have in terms of optimising that energy mix. And so I agree with you that the challenge is how do you provide more energy with a lower carbon intensity, and that's what we're actually aiming for. And I think to add maybe to what you were saying, Michele, in the frame of potential levers to get there, we will have fossil fuels, we will have gas in the system still in 2050, right? Gas has a more resilient profile, oil, I talked to some of the numbers. We have the technologies, including specifically CCS today, to actually abate emissions from industrial use of fossil fuels. So let's not forget this is not a net zero, it doesn't mean no fossil fuels in the system in 2050. So the question becomes, how do we actually also accelerate those technologies to prepare for that? Let's turn to an area of innovation. Many sustainable startups are entering the scene from electric vehicles to eco-friendly food producers and more, and these players are now pushing legacy players into innovative spaces really just to stay competitive. How is BP navigating managing their current business practices while staying competitive against new players? So no, you're right. It's an exciting environment. Many startups, many new companies playing a role, in particular in the space of mobility and EV, but not only, also in the broader energy transition space. We actually in BP have our own organization, it's called Launchpad and Ventures, which focuses on venturing, incubation of internal ideas, and then Launchpad is the startup building and accelerator. And I actually have a pleasure of having that organization sitting within my areas of accountability. So if I look at Launchpad, which is a startup builder, we now have seven companies into Launchpad with the potential to build interesting, accelerating, transformational opportunities. So to give you an example of one of the companies which I had the pleasure of visiting a few weeks back when I was in New York, this is Blueprint Power. What Blueprint Power does is it basically converts residential buildings into virtual power plants. So it aggregates energy demand from residential buildings, and it gives you the opportunity to then generate and trade that energy. The way they do it is by putting a box in your building, basically real-time measuring of energy consumption. And on the basis of that, they can help you actually optimize that consumption, but also recommend storage, low carbon. And if you link that to our training activity, you can see how that becomes a virtual power plant. So it's a very interesting company led by an amazing CEO, Robin Beavers. So we're active in that space. I would also say, Alison, that I think for the energy transition, to be successful, you need both. You need startups, you need new companies, but you need players such as us to transition. The way I actually see it is you need it for the world. And take Tesla, you mentioned Tesla. Tesla in 2021 sold, I think, 1 million cars, and I think that was double from 2020. That's great. But it's 1.5%, 1.4% of global market share. So you need the Teslas of the world, but you also need the Toyotas and the Volkswagens of the world to actually transition. And if I bring that back to the world of energy, similarly, we need new players and startups, but we need companies such as BP to transition. If I look at it from an investor standpoint, to the previous question you asked me, it actually, we define this as a greening company, or we define ourselves as a greening company. And I think one of the pluses is it exposes you to the upside in terms of the resilient hydrocarbons, oil and gas demand, while also exposing you to the growth in terms of that transition play. And so, yes, we're active, but I think we need both. And at the end of the day, it's all hands on deck to make this happen. Interesting. Innovation is clearly going to be a key part of this. And Michele, if we look at the performance of integrated oil companies, they've done very well year to date. I actually think they're the only sector up year to date. But despite that, they are still trading at historically low multiples. So do you think that they are undervalued at this point? And if so, what will it take to re-rate them higher? I do believe that they are undervalued here. And I think that there will be three key drivers of our performance here. The first one is the companies themselves taking advantage of the low multiples through buybacks. And some of these companies are currently buying back 5 to 10 percent of their own shares on an annual basis. Secondly, I think there is a rethinking about natural gas as a green transition fuel and as a key driver of energy security. And this makes up almost half of the business of these companies, which has long duration and which has a key role for society. And then finally, I think there needs to be a re-appreciation that although these companies are not green today, they are some of the biggest global investors into green technology and that the path of reduction in carbon intensity of the businesses is consistent with the Paris Agreement. Giulia was highlighting it before, but our carbonomics analysis, where we've looked at reimagining big oils into big energy, would support the same conclusion that these companies have the key pillars of decarbonisation that can make them consistent with the Paris Agreement. So my sense is it's a threefold drive here towards a re-rating. Cash distribution to shareholders, ongoing capital discipline and buyback, a re-evaluation of the role of natural gas, and finally, a rethinking of these companies as greening companies consistent with the Paris Agreement. Michele, Giulia, so glad you could both join us today. Thank you, Alison. Thank you very much.
