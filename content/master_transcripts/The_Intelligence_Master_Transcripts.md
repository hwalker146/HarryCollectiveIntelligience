What are the options available? Hamas at the moment has a delegation in Cairo where the Egyptians are believed to have put on the table a new proposal in consultation with Qatar and Turkey and that proposal provides for the decommissioning of Hamas's weapons, a Dissolution of its armed forces, the freeing of the reigning hostages and the surrender of power So essentially this is like Hamas giving up everything that it's really built up over the last almost 40 years of its existence In exchange Palestinians would secure a full Israeli withdrawal They'd get an interim Palestinian technocratic administration and they'd also get a UN sanctioned international force which would come in in place of the Israelis and At some point the restoration of Gaza's rubble If they don't acquiesce, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister is threatening to launch an offensive to fully occupy Gaza Including the last 15% of the strip that's still in Palestinian hands and indeed that offensive has already begun there's heavy bombardment of The last cities that still have a Palestinian population within them, Gaza City and Deir el-Badr That began on August the 12th and another offensive would just completely destroy what little remains and could end up inflicting not just Hamas but Palestinians themselves from their coastal homeland entirely And given the gravity of the situation then are we at last at a point that Hamas will bend to the pressure? The decision really comes down to one man, Khalil Hayah He's the head of the Gaza wing of the movement. He arrived in Cairo on August the 12th Historically, he's had a close relationship with Yahya Sinwar whose decision it was to launch the October the 7th attack He's close to the military wing as well, the Ezzedin al-Qassam brigades But that pressure on Mr. Hayah is really onerous You've got pressure from the outside as we mentioned you've got that Israeli bombardment of the last cities Which are still standing in Gaza You've also got just a completely different geo-strategic reality in the Middle East For the past two years all the external backers of Hamas have been hobbled Hezbollah in Lebanon has been pummeled and is now going through a process of disarmament Iran has been pushed back from the Mediterranean from Lebanon through Syria It's under pressure in Iraq really to its borders So those are the two pry backers of the armed wing the Ezzedin al-Qassam brigades and then as far as the political wing is concerned Qatar and Turkey are also showing signs of losing patience with Hamas's foot dragging Indeed, it said that Hamas's leaders have already left Doha the Qatari capital about two weeks ago and haven't returned So on all fronts externally they're under pressure and it's not clear What their way of surviving as a movement at all is going to be without that external backing so clearly pressure on Hamas from a number of Sources and other fronts. What about its support within Gaza? If the pressure from outside is severe It's almost unbearable from within and essentially Hamas was born in Gaza Its constituency is primarily from Gaza and over the last two years The population which may initially have cheered the October the 7th attack on Israel's southern flank has really turned And the price for the population is just becoming simply unbearable there is just a kind of a Cry that you hear from every conversation you have with people in Gaza Just they want this nightmare to end and the longer the Hamas has seemed to procrastinate over these Negotiations for a ceasefire the more frustrated that population has become Very few people see value in a resistance that has failed to protect them They've seen everything that they've built over the last 70 years Smashed within two years gone are their universities, their schools, their hospitals, hotels, high-rises Even the cemeteries have been ground to dust and their best academics, their doctors, their journalists lay under that rubble And those who are still alive just can often feel like the kind of walking dead, they're homeless, they're destitute, they're Unemployed, they're desperately hungry And so while Hamas's armed wing, the Hazardous Hand Brigades shelter in their tunnels and Hamas's politicians negotiate from the relative comfort of exile Israel is raining down fire on the ground and still killing about an average of a hundred civilians a day And as I said, they've got this fresh bombardment that has started in the cities So you can even hear that dissent now not just on the streets but within Hamas's ranks and You can tune into whatsapp groups where Hamas affiliates are calling for their movement to lay down their arms before Gaza suffers even more loss But what happens to Hamas as a movement if they do lay down their arms? If that is a decision that Khalil al-Hayya and the rest of the movement, the political leadership take then It's said that the Hazardous Hand Brigades will heed that call You've got pragmatists within Hamas who are vying to fill the vacuum at the head of Hamas's Politburo after Yahya Sinwar The head of the movement was killed in October last year One of the people who's perhaps a prime contender come elections within the movement is Khalid Mashaal He's the head of the diaspora wing He's been a head of the movement in the past and he's been a longtime advocate of politics over the armed struggle And he's been waiting in the wings for years for a chance to return to the helm There are those who just want to go even further who say that this is a time when Hamas should reinvent itself as a political party perhaps on the model of Northern Ireland's Sinn Féin or Incredibly even Israel's own Islamist party the United Arab List And that's a party which could then sign up to the conditions which the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has set for participation in the political process inside the West Bank and Gaza and If that political party did find itself back within the framework of normative Palestinian politics Then it could be the case it could do actually quite well of the polls Even though Hamas has lost a huge amount of support in Gaza There's still significant admiration for its greatest ability to hang on against the Middle East most powerful military Machine when others are folded in the West Bank and in the broader diaspora. So whatever they've lost in Gaza they might recoup in other parts of the Palestinian polity But what about the militants the hard core of Hamas the ones who would actually be putting down the guns with their own hands? How do they feel about that possible eventuality? I mean from the conversations that I've had with not the commanders themselves But with the sons of the commanders who were in exile There's a lot of resistance to what they would see as a surrender and acceptance of these terms They still think they have significant forces in the tunnels. They don't think they've got much to gain by handing over their weapons I think that many of them might be pushed out of Gaza as part of the terms of a settlement into exile and They also feel that for all the losses that Gaza has taken and all the sacrifices that it's made It hasn't been without some return as they say Israel standing in the world has been Really badly bruised and many of them would draw a comparison with the Algerian War of Independence Against the French in which a million Algerians were killed and even though France won the battle such was the ignominy in which it was held by the rest of the world that it lost the kind of moral legitimacy to continue in Algeria and Withdrew and they do see a parallel with Israel in Gaza And so they feel that ultimately that reward of liberation will be worth the cost that they're not paying And that's why they say they want to fight on and there's another reason why they want to fight on They don't believe that these negotiations are gonna lead anywhere the Americans and the Israelis aren't in the room They don't trust Netanyahu. They think that he wants to push on and conquer the strip regardless And so they don't really think they've got a choice and the only option they've got is to stand by their guns Nicholas thanks very much for your time Thank You Jason always a pleasure You Every business has an ambition PayPal open is the platform designed to help you grow into yours with business loans So you can expand and access to hundreds of millions of PayPal customers worldwide and your customers can pay all the ways With PayPal Venmo pay later and all major cards so you can focus on scaling up when it's time to get growing There's one platform for all business PayPal open grow today at PayPal open comm Loan subject to approval in available locations. Did you know tide has been upgraded to provide an even better clean in cold water? Tide is specifically designed to fight any stain you throw at it even in cold Butter yep chocolate ice cream sure thing barbecue sauce tides got you covered You don't need to use warm water Additionally tide pods let you confidently fight tough stains with new cold time technology Just remember if it's got to be clean. It's got to be tied You Fun fact that 21st century acronym FOMO the fear of missing out was actually coined in the magazine of the Harvard Business School It's a sort of personal ineffable feeling Maybe you do want to go out tonight after all but it's also as the Harvard business types would have it an effect with economic consequences and That kind of fear may actually be an overlooked force driving the markets There's a standard model of investment where? Investors will only take on more risk if they get higher returns in compensation and in this standard model Risk is defined by how much prices swing around Josh Roberts is our capital markets correspondent But a recent study Suggests that something's missing from this model that risk doesn't do a very good job of explaining how markets work And it proposes a different idea as the driving force instead fear Okay, so we're gonna rewrite the maths we have a new variable F for fear tell me how it figures in So it's based on a working paper by Rob Arnott of research affiliates and Edward Macquarie Who's from Santa Clara University and what they've done is they've looked at the historical record They've actually gone back to in a bit centuries and they concluded that over a really long span of time Risk as conventionally defined does an inadequate job of Explaining how stock markets have actually moved relative to bond markets So risk does an inadequate job of explaining how the stock market actually works. So we need a paradigm shift We need something new to explain what drives returns We'll hold it right there doing well the conclusion of the working paper is based on a historical study But if you look around today, it certainly resonates with what we're seeing in markets Stock markets are hitting all-time highs all around the world and yet the risks just seem to keep piling up. There's geopolitics There's trade wars. There's actual wars There's vast government borrowing which to be corrected can only really involve quite a bit of economic pain and yet Stock markets at all-time highs Investors are pricing bonds as if they were less risky than ever So right now risk doesn't really seem to be doing an adequate job of explaining how markets are working So it does seem like an alternative explanation might be quite good or as you earlier said paradigm shift Which I'm often loathe to use but talk me through it. What's the new lens to look through at this? So risk theory says that Investors in pricing assets look at any swing in asset price and consider that to be risky So whether prices are going up very sharply or down very sharply They consider both of those things risky and demand higher returns in response This paper says hold on that's not really how investors think about risk people aren't afraid that An asset might deliver higher returns than expected They're only afraid that it might deliver lower returns than expected or outright losses. So they say, okay, let's get rid of this idea that investors price assets according to all swings in their prices and Say instead they only price them based on fear of losses That's one sort of fear the other sort of fear that they propose as an explanation for asset pricing is fear of missing out Another thing I might fear is that I don't own an asset that everybody else owns and that goes up a lot So an example would be recently if I haven't owned Nvidia, which unfortunately I haven't owned Nvidia It's gone up a lot. Lots of other investors have they've made massive profits and I've missed out on them That's another fear that investors would want to avoid. I Mean what you're saying here Josh much like the standard model of asset pricing that you described earlier does make some intuitive sense here I mean, what do you what do you make of this new way of thinking about it? I think this new way of thinking about it makes more intuitive sense to me if you're worried about an asset You're not worried that it might deliver better returns than expected You're only worried that it might deliver a loss and fear of missing out is also it's a rational human emotion People sometimes talk about it as if it's irrational But if I'm a fund manager, I don't own a stock that does really well all the other fund managers own that stock I'm getting fired because I've been beaten by the market for a long time. So that's an entirely rational response similarly If I'm a normal person and all of my friends own an investment that makes the massive profits and I can't afford to go Out for dinner with them anymore. That's an actual risk. It's it's not irrational So I do think the new theory makes intuitive sense The trouble is that the maths is likely to be formidable and honor and Macquarie admit this They don't work through the mass of the new theory They're inviting other people to join them and try to figure out what the maths would be One of the appeals of risk theory is that the maths is relatively straightforward It's still quite complicated, but it's you know, you can work through it Fear theory is likely to be a lot harder to do actual work with but the tantalizing Offer is that it provides a much better explanation of how markets work and obviously we should want that Josh thanks very much for your time. Thanks for having me Jason After America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th 1945 Japan surrendered within days On August 15th 80 years ago today Emperor Hirohito's declaration of surrender was broadcast by radio across Japan Frasier McGill wraith is the author of archive 1945 an account of how the Economist reported on the end of the Second World War Parts of the country's armed forces still wanted to keep fighting Some would hold out for years Refusing to believe the news of the Emperor's surrender When Hiro Onoda came out of a jungle earlier this year and surrendered his Japanese army sword The story how he had carried on World War two in his own way for 30 years made a deep impression on many of his countrymen In Britain Prime Minister Clement Attlee's Labour Party had defeated the Conservatives under Winston Churchill in a general election only a few weeks prior at midnight Hours after Hirohito's address Attlee made a radio broadcast of his own The Economist welcomed the end of the conflict in its August the 18th edition The war is won Now the carnage and destruction can cease The creative energies of mankind can be withdrawn from slaughter and battle and be devoted to the rebuilding of a decent world But the Allies relief at the end of the fighting was tempered by America's use of nuclear weapons The world was entering a nuclear age and would need to contain its apocalyptic threat It is because this task is so vast and the implications of failure so terrifying that most people are facing victory Not only with profound relief and thankfulness, but also with a sense of uneasiness and awe The bombs which wiped out Hiroshima and Nagasaki stopped the war but they started something else a new age in human history in which the issue of peace and war is literally the issue of extermination or survival Who can fail under those circumstances to approach the task of making peace with passionate hope and anxiety After its surrender, Japan would be transformed America would occupy the country until 1952 General Douglas MacArthur, the American general in charge of the Allied forces, would make sweeping reforms to its army political system, economy, and society Debates surrounded the position of the Emperor After much deliberation America decided that Hirohito would be allowed to stay but only in a ceremonial role How does his continued presence square with the Allied insistence on an end to militarism? Is it comparable to the survival in office of a Hitler or a Mussolini? Does an Emperor necessarily imply imperialism? The decision has aroused uneasiness particularly in Australia It is however possible to argue that the Emperor's position resembles that of a King Victor Emmanuel or a King Michael Japan, like Italy and Romania, has not fought to the last The Germans, lacking any constitutional machinery to effect a change in authority, were compelled to do so This fact alone differentiates the Japanese Emperor from the fascist chieftains Japan's Empire would be broken up Korea would become independent Taiwan, then called Formosa, would return to Chinese control, as would Manchuria The Soviet Union would also make claims of its own The Russians are showing signs in the Far East, as well as in Europe, of returning to the policies of Tsarism More complicated territorial wrangling would ensue over Mongolia and other parts of the Asian mainland Yet the case of Japan itself would be simpler Unlike Germany, which would be occupied and divided by the main Allied powers, in Japan America would take full responsibility The Potsdam Declaration guarantees Japan access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted There is far more sanity in these clauses than in the swinging economic conditions imposed on Germany The Japanese people, freed from the incubus of a war industry, which by 1938 was absorbing 61% of their national income, have a chance of recovering a measure of prosperity and of contributing to the rebuilding of Asia It would take time for the last of the fighting to cease On September the 2nd, Japanese officials formally signed Japan's surrender on the USS Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay The Japanese envoys arrive Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who lost a leg in a Shanghai air raid, hovels on board He will sign on behalf of his emperor General MacArthur made a short address The war in the Pacific, and with it the Second World War, was over To learn more about the 1945, just open up the Economist app, or visit economist.com slash interactive The Economist That's all for this episode of the intelligence The show's editors are Chris Impey and Jat Gill.

The Economist Hello and welcome to The Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host, Jason Palmer. Every weekday, we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. The Inflation For a long while in Japan, after the bursting of the asset price bubble in the 1990s and a long era of deflation, investment just didn't look smart. With inflation now on the way up, all that is changing. Across the board, Japanese people have investing fever. And here are some words that until recently didn't really go together in America. The Indy Wrestling League. The big purveyors of the country's fakest sport are on the ropes, and lots of smaller, frankly bonkers, outfits are drawing dedicated crowds. But first… For nearly seven decades of work by artificial intelligence researchers, not a whole lot happened. There was even an AI winter, when many thought the field was just dead. Boy, did that change quick. In 2017, Google researchers came up with something called a transformer. No, not that kind, it's a mathematical thing. The next year, a little American company called OpenAI had turned that thing into a generative pre-trained transformer, GPT for short. You see where this is going. In 2022, out came chat-GPT, and the world lost its collective mind. Suddenly not even three years later, AI has gone fully, pervasively global, and OpenAI is still at the frontier. Last week with GPT-5. It can write an entire computer program from scratch to help you with whatever you'd like. And we think this idea of software on demand is going to be one of the defining characteristics of the GPT-5 era. It can help you plan a party, send invitations, order supplies. It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey. It can provide you information to learn about any topic you'd like, and much more. This is an incredible superpower on demand. Sam Altman, OpenAI's boss, is, as the field demands, a bit breathless. He's got plenty of competition at home and abroad. So where is it all going on, and where is it all going? GPT-5 is the new AI model from OpenAI. It's the first understandable model number since GPT-4 two years ago, and it is the best AI in the world, for now. Alex Hearn is the Economist's AI writer. GPT-5 is exactly as good as we expected it would be, which means if you're looking at the graphs of AI capability that veer up and to the right, it takes us another step closer towards this artificial general intelligence that is due 2027 or so. So first off, talk me through GPT-5, what it does, what are the new features, what are the new lights on the dashboard? It is an incremental upgrade, and I think that's a problem for OpenAI. GPT-5 is roughly two months better than the last frontier system OpenAI put out roughly two months ago. In the world of AI development, two months of progress is meaningful, and GPT-5 does better on a lot of the benchmarks that OpenAI care about. It's smarter at solving coding challenges. It has a greater general knowledge of scientific questions. It, according to one internal benchmark that we can't externally verify, is very, very nearly as good at expert level knowledge work as a panel of experts that OpenAI compares it to. It beats them on about 48% of tasks. With GPT-5, now it's like talking to an expert, a legitimate PhD level expert in anything, any area you need, on demand, that can help you with whatever your goals are. All of those things are great, but they are incremental. And when Sam Altman, OpenAI's boss, was presenting GPT-5 to the world, he spent a lot of time talking about the vibe, about the way this just feels better, smarter. I suppose it's a fair thing to focus on if wider adoption is the key, the goal for a lot of these companies, though. I mean, what are people saying about GPT-5? It's got mixed reviews on the ground. Some of that is because they've introduced a new way of using GPT-5, which they're calling a unified model. Until now, you had to, if you cared enough, go to this obscure menu, the model picker, and effectively tell OpenAI how much you wanted the AI system to actually think about your question. You could pick O3 Pro, where it would sit silently and think for 15 minutes before giving an answer. Or you could pick 4.0, and it would just blurt out whatever it thought very quickly. GPT-5 is supposed to route those questions to the best way of tackling them possible, but a lot of users have complained that what it actually does is give you a glib, instantaneous answer to some questions that deserve to be thought about for longer. But the loudest people complaining about this have a very different problem. They're people who effectively had a relationship with GPT-4. That relationship, for some of them, was that they used it as a therapist. For others, it was more literal. There's whole communities of people who have, over the course of months and months of conversations with their chatbot, started treating it like a friend, or in some cases, a romantic partner. They view the release of GPT-5 as effectively a personality transplant for a digital human that they got to know and love. Putting aside the sort of sociological and indeed very personal here, you said at the start that this is pretty much where we would expect GPT-5 to be. What do you mean by that? One of the top-level measurements of AI quality that I've been tracking for a while comes from an independent group called META, that's META with an R at the end, it stands for Model Evaluation and Threat Research. They've been tracking for some number of months now the most complicated tasks that AI models can solve with 50% accuracy, and how long it would take a human being to solve that same task. And so in 2019, GPT-1, the very first version, could achieve 50% accuracy on tasks it took software engineers two seconds to do. A year later, it could do tasks that took software engineers around eight seconds. In 2023, GPT-4 could tackle tasks that took around four minutes. Trendline is a doubling of complexity of duration of task around every 200 days. And GPT-5 is on trend. It can handle tasks that would take a human software engineer around a little over two hours to do. We've constrained ourselves so far to discussing OpenAI and its models. Is that in line with what other companies in other countries are doing? OpenAI is regularly at the frontier, right? It frequently has the best model in the world. But this 200 day doubling in capability issue, if you're scared of AI getting too good too quickly, is reflected across the industry. And that's not just the American industry. Chinese AI labs have also been bringing out AI models that are just better and better at a frankly astonishing pace. In China, particularly, because they've been doing it backwards and in heels. They have no access to the absolute top flight AI chips made by NVIDIA. Even the second tier chips that were initially made for the Chinese market were put under export controls from April to July until the US government lifted those restrictions. In the last month alone, there's been three major releases from Chinese apps, Z.AI, Moonshot AI and Alibaba, a huge Chinese tech company. And we're all still waiting to see the next thing that comes from DeepSeek, the Chinese startup that burst onto the scene in January this year with DeepSeek R1. It's clearly developing DeepSeek R2, hasn't released it yet. And if they maintain their quality, the new world number one could come from China, not America. And thinking about that line that describes the doubling of capacity, let's look a little further ahead on it to AGI. This plainly puts us on a path there. Are there any roadblocks in between? I think it's more the other way round, right? It's a very naive analysis. This is a line on a logarithmic chart, but if the line stays in the same shape and goes in the same direction, well, then you end up with AI models being able to do a task that would take an entire working day by 2027, an entire working week before the end of Donald Trump's term in office, let's say. That's the sort of threshold at which people start talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, an AI system that can do all the work a human being can do, at least in the knowledge sphere. That, if AI systems get there, would reshape the entire global economy. And so the question isn't, are there any obvious roadblocks lying between here and there, it's do we have any reason to expect the progress that we've got so far to slow down? AI is defined by the scaling law. You just throw more data, more compute in a big bucket and stir it with a stick and it learns to do PhD level maths. We don't yet know whether ever bigger buckets with ever more data and ever more computing power will get us to this general intelligence. There may need to be more fundamental breakthroughs. But the incredible thing about the AI industry is it's got us from 2018 to here without really needing to do any fundamental science. To repeat this insane analogy, we've just made the bucket bigger and bigger and bigger. Alex, thanks as ever for joining us. Thank you for having me. Alex also sat down with my colleagues over on Babbage, our weekly subscriber only show on science and technology. They really got under the hood, bonnet, of AI efforts in China. There's now a huge ecosystem of Chinese AI labs, all learning from each other, all cross-hiring with each other and releasing new frontier models that have changed what we think about Chinese AI. Look for Babbage tomorrow and every Wednesday, wherever fine podcasts are sold and traded. I'm no tech genius, but I knew if I wanted my business to crush it, I needed a website.

But attitudes towards investing have changed a lot in recent years. Gradually the base of people investing in Japan has grown. It's really not difficult to spot the change. If you walk into a bookstore, you see entire sections dedicated to financial guides. And if you go on the train, you see a lot of advertisements about investing seminars. Now aged 31, Ponchio has a YouTube channel with almost 500,000 subscribers. Ponchio is just one of the many online influencers here in Japan. He makes tutorial videos on how to build a portfolio or how to open a brokerage account. He says that these days, especially young people are realizing that it's wasteful to leave your money sitting in savings. So Moeka, what's behind the change here? Why the change in attitude? Beginning last year, the Japanese government overhauled the NISA scheme, which is a tax-free investing scheme modeled on Britain's ISA. And this has prompted a very big shift in how Japanese people hold their assets. So at the end of 2023, over half of Japanese household assets were held in cash and bank deposits, which is much higher compared to other countries. And the NISA scheme turned out to be more successful than a lot of people anticipated. Retail investors have opened 5 million new accounts since the NISA scheme was overhauled. And also earlier this year, the total amount of money invested in NISA reached 59 trillion yen, which is around $400 billion, hitting the government's target three years ahead of schedule. Politicians have been very keen to promote this shift as well. If we can get even a portion of this huge amount of cash that is sitting in people's savings into companies and into investment, that could have big implications for the Japanese economy. But why are people responding so much? As you say, there hasn't been a culture of investing. People thought even that it was shady. Why have they been so enthusiastic about the NISA? So the reason why people haven't been so enthusiastic about it was partly because of the burst of the Japanese bubble economy in the early 1990s, which made people very wary of risk assets. But the younger generations don't have this trauma in their living memory. And they're also living in a very different economic environment compared to older generations. So as I mentioned, Japan had been in a deflationary environment. So that made it more rational to keep your money sitting in savings. But we start having inflation. So that means if you have cash sitting in your savings, the value of it is going to decline. So there's more incentive for people to put their money into these risk assets. And then on the other hand, you see these efforts among the private sector or companies as well to attract more retail investors. Companies have been working on becoming more shareholder friendly. So in recent years, we started seeing more companies doing share buybacks and raising dividends. And that has made retail investing more attractive. You mentioned that the sense of risk is different among the young. What about the older people in Japan's economy who play such a strong role? Older generations are more cautious of investing. They think it's dangerous. They have this trauma of the bubble burst, but they are the people who have more savings as well. So the government has been eyeing these older people's bank deposits and have been trying to push older people to invest as well. So now the government is considering a scheme called Platinum Nisa. In the current scheme, monthly dividend funds are excluded, but now they're thinking of allowing this for investors over age 65. And that would make it easier for pensioners and older people to invest while drawing down assets. So this all sounds win, win, win. It's good for older people. It's good for younger people. And it's going to give the economy a boost. Yes. So it seems like the boom is here to stay, and that would have a very positive effect on the economy. But there is something that people have been criticizing. People here complain that too many retail investors are investing abroad and not investing enough in Japanese companies, which people say similarly about Britain's ISA. When it comes to individual stocks, Japanese investors are mostly investing in Japanese companies. But the picture is very different when you look at mutual funds. Some estimates suggest that as much as 80% or 90% of Nisa money that is invested in mutual funds is actually flowing abroad. Beyond the numbers, I also sense this just talking to retail investors. Investing in Nisa has been such a hot topic. When people talk about what to invest in, their default purchases are usually the S&P 500, or there's an index called ORCA, which is short for All Country, which is a tracker for global equities, but mostly American ones and not so much Japanese one. Some people argue that this is basically capital flight. It's good that people are now investing and there's an investment culture, but Japanese companies are not reaping the benefits. That might be annoying for policymakers in Japan, but maybe it's a sign that Japanese investors are demonstrating wisdom beyond their years. It's always good not to be too exposed to your home market. Thanks very much for your time, Aoika. Thank you so much for having me, Jason. A man wearing an inflatable eagle costume introduces the main contender. Here's the great U.S. A-hole, dressed in cowboy boots, a shirt depicting a bald eagle, and a backwards stars and stripes baseball cap. Daniel Knowles is our Midwest correspondent. Then comes his opponent, Canadab, a polite father in double denim and a Canada jersey to electronic strains of O'Canada. You know, in the time Canadab has come out for your super wrestlers, super shows, it's true, I've rattled a few cages, eh? As the two warm up, U.S. A-hole shouts out an insult. Bartender, I need some ice. And a crowd of about 500 people, many of whom are dressed in support of their characters, erupts in boos. Super wrestlers is an indie wrestling league in Chicago. It's been going for a few years, and this was its 10th edition. They describe themselves as Earth's strangest pro wrestling show, and I'm pretty sure there's no doubt about that. Besides U.S. A-hole and Canadab, the recent show featured Pharaoh Smith, Stephen Flo, and the pubic moose wearing an antler hat and a large wig over his groin. Pro wrestling has long been dominated by the WWE, which had revenues last year of $1.4 billion. Recently, the franchise has been stuttering. Smackdown, the weekly show, has seen lower viewership this year, and WWE Raw, which is a second show, has struggled with a move to Netflix. That revenue growth has tailed off, and All Elite Wrestling, the biggest competitor, has been eating into its market share. Indie wrestling shows are booming, though fewer are as silly as the super wrestlers. Game Changer Wrestling, a hardcore wrestling league which started in New Jersey, now puts shows on all over the world. Its appeal seems to be a lot more violence. Or there's the International Wrestling Cartel, which is an indie league that came out of Pittsburgh and is often seen as a training ground for new wrestlers elsewhere. Imports are thriving too, such as New Japan Pro Wrestling, which is shown on AXS, a cable TV channel. So what's driving this shift? Social media is a big part of it. A generation ago, wrestling fans could really only watch what was on television, and that meant WWE. But nowadays, wrestling leagues can promote themselves on YouTube. Weird can work. The super wrestlers take a lot of their inspiration from Chicago's comedy and theatre scene, which inspires a lot of the experimentation. Is politics playing a role too? With the exception of golf, few sports are so closely linked to Donald Trump as pro wrestling. Vince McMahon, the co-founder of WWE, who resigned in disgrace after a sex handle last year, is a close friend of the president, and his ex-wife Linda is Mr. Trump's education secretary. Hulk Hogan, a WWE veteran who died recently, tore off his shirt to support Mr. Trump's re-election bid at the Republican National Convention last year. Mr. Trump's own style of politics is often said to be inspired by kayfabe, the wrestling term for how everyone knows the action is fake, but agrees to pretend it's not. Turns out the fans of USA Hulk can suspend their disbelief too. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Butter? Yep. Chocolate ice cream? Sure thing.

I'm Jason Palmer. And I'm Rosie Blore. Every weekday, we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. A law mandating married couples to share a surname has become the center of what could be called Japan's culture wars. And there's a plausible argument that repealing it might help to address the country's rock-bottom birth rate. And Bad Bunny was the most played artist on Spotify between 2020 and 2022. He's achieved global success, is embarking on a sellout international tour, and he sings in Spanish. Our correspondent explains how this Puerto Rican artist changed the rules of pop stardom. But first… Stop! Stop! Stop! From Britain to Belgium, Greece to Korea, international horror at what's going on in Gaza has been growing louder and louder. In an alert sent out this morning, a UN-backed food agency parsed its words, saying the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip. Expect to hear that word again. Last week, more than 100 aid agencies warned that mass starvation is happening. Even Donald Trump has acknowledged the situation and the response. Those children were very hungry, but we're giving a lot of money and a lot of food. And other nations are now stepping up. On Sunday, Israel relented, a bit. It announced what it called a tactical pause in some areas of Gaza for humanitarian purposes. Aid routes were to be open. Outside countries were permitted to airdrop food. Yet even yesterday, outside a hospital in Khan Younis, people dragged carts loaded with casualties. They said Israeli forces had fired on crowds waiting for aid south of the city. The tactics, the pauses, the humanitarian purposes, it doesn't add up. What's clear over the past few days is that Israeli policy in Gaza has created starvation. I think Israel has tacitly acknowledged that now and begun to reverse aspects of its policy under tremendous international pressure. But what it has done so far is what the UN aid chief calls a drop in the ocean. It's nowhere near sufficient to address this very severe crisis of hunger in Gaza. And only a permanent end to the war really will end the suffering there. So let's start with what's going on at the moment as per Israel. What are these tactical pauses? In theory, they're meant to facilitate both the entry of aid into Gaza and then the distribution of that aid within Gaza. So there are two elements to these pauses as they've been announced by Israel. First, you have what is meant to be a 10-hour ceasefire in three parts of Gaza. Gaza City in the north, Deir el-Balah in the center, and then al-Mawasi, which is that teeming tent city in the southern part of Gaza where much of the population has been displaced over the past year. Israel is meant to stop fighting in those areas between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. And again, in theory, that allows Palestinians to go and collect aid. Along with that, you also have what the army is calling secure distribution routes that operate under a slightly longer timeframe from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day. Those are the routes that the UN and other organizations are supposed to be able to use to bring aid into Gaza from Israel and from Egypt. And so these two things put together are meant to start addressing the problem of starvation in Gaza. And the Israeli army has said it's prepared to expand both the scale and perhaps the duration of these pauses if necessary. And this is explicitly or implicitly simply a reaction to international outrage? I think so. Back in March, of course, Israel imposed a complete siege on Gaza, prevented any aid of any kind from entering the territory for about two and a half months. At the end of May, you had the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is this Israeli and American-backed entity that started distributing limited amounts of food aid in the southern part of Gaza. That entity has been operating for about two months now, and it's been a disaster. It's brought in, by its own calculations, less than one meal per Palestinian per day. So it's not coming close to meeting the demand for food in Gaza. And then, of course, you have these near-daily incidents where Palestinians have been shot by Israeli soldiers while trying to get to the distribution sites. More than 800 people were killed last month in Gaza just trying to collect aid. So not enough aid going in, very difficult to access. Obviously, that has created a very real problem in Gaza now, and it's one that has finally, in the past couple of weeks, attracted the world's attention. It's been on the front pages of newspapers around the world. We've heard a number of Western politicians, including Donald Trump, just on Monday, condemning and criticizing what Israel has done in Gaza and the level of starvation in Gaza. And even some Israeli officials, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, saying that the whole world is pissed off with us, he said, because of the desperation in Gaza. So it's something that, again, it's not just international pressure, even some Israelis criticizing this. But I think, as you said, Jason, it's really been this outpouring of international criticism that has forced Israel to change course. And do you think it is changing course, though? Do you think these tactical pauses are a wider releasing of pressure, kind of starting up? Or is this just enough to quiet the critics for now and then back to business as it was? I think if past is precedent, then it's probably the latter. I think it means there is just a red line, even for this Israeli government, when it comes to how much they are going to immiserate people in Gaza. It's too early to make any real judgment about how these pauses are going thus far. What we've seen first are several countries, including Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, carrying out airdrops in Gaza. They, on Sunday, dropped about 25 tons of food into the territory, which is an impressive-sounding number, but it's actually less than two trucks can carry into Gaza. So airdrops, not a solution at all. They're a very inefficient way to distribute aid for more than 2 million people. And then you have these routes that the UN is meant to be able to use to bring aid into Gaza. And I said before, in theory, that will help. But in practice, what we've seen over the past almost two years now is that the UN is routinely blocked by Israel from bringing aid in. So if these routes are actually used, if Israel allows the UN to use them to bring hundreds of trucks a day into Gaza, that will start making a difference. But I think there's reason to be skeptical that Israel is actually going to do that, that this will be something more than just a means to relieve some international pressure. And you started off by saying, Greg, that the only thing that would definitively end the suffering is an end to the war. Are we any closer to that? What does that side of things look like? I don't think we are, unfortunately. We had a month of stop-start ceasefire talks in Qatar and in Italy and elsewhere, but I don't think we are yet at a point where Israel and Hamas have resolved their differences about what is meant to be, right now, just an interim 60-day ceasefire that will buy time for negotiations about a permanent end to the war. Every indication is that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, still doesn't want to end the war for good. There's one man who could force him to change his mind. That's Donald Trump. He's been all over the place in his comments over the past few days. He made some slightly cryptic remarks about how, well, the ceasefire talks didn't work, so we might have to try something else to get the hostages out. Not clear what that means. He suggested that he will give Israel an even freer hand to keep fighting against Hamas in Gaza. So at times he sounds quite hawkish, but then meeting on Monday with Keir Starmer, he seemed somewhat moved by starvation in Gaza, by the plight of Gazans, and he sounded a bit more dovish. What we have seen so far through now six months of his presidency is that he doesn't seem willing to really put pressure on the Israeli prime minister to end the war for good. I think as long as that doesn't happen, as long as the fighting continues, it's impossible to distribute aid properly to all of the people who need it in Gaza. And so even if a lot of food gets into Gaza right now, I think at this point the very grim reality is that many more people are going to continue to die. Greg, thanks very much for joining us.

For a couple that has divorced three times, Uchiyama Yukari and Koike Yukio get along surprisingly well. Moeka Iida writes about Japan for The Economist. The two teachers live in the city of Nagano in central Japan, and they've never actually fallen out of love. But they've parted several times on paper to work around an unusual law in Japan, one that requires married couples to have the same surname. Ms. Uchiyama told me she hadn't really given much thought to the idea, or to her own surname before getting married. But then she realized she was quite attached to her name, and it's part of who she is. She didn't want to give it up, even after marriage. So the couple decided to live outside of wet block. Well, most of the time. There is an exception. Each time the couple has a child, they remarry, because that makes registering the birth easier. And then they divorce again. So what's going on here, Moeka? Why must married people have the same surname in Japan? So I understand in a lot of countries, there's this social pressure for married couples to share the same family name. But I've come across reports that say Japan is the only country in the world that makes it a legal requirement. And this has been a really hot-button issue in Japan. Activists have been calling for change for a very long time. But this year felt quite different. And there were real hopes for change. In May, for the first time in nearly three decades, politicians debated on this issue. Opposition parties submitted bills that would have allowed more flexibility to the system. But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or the LDP, didn't submit a bill of its own. And in the end, no legislation came out of it. And so what arguments are the campaigners putting forward, simply that people should be able to use the name they wish? So that's largely it. But there are several arguments around this issue. There was a study recently that suggested if the current trend continues over hundreds of years, everybody in Japan is going to end up with the surname Sato, which is the most common surname here. The case is that changing the rule will allow preserving these unique and rare Japanese surnames. But on a more serious note, this is seen as a problem of gender inequality. Law doesn't officially say that women have to take the husband's name. But that's what happens in 95% of cases. And this has especially become an issue as women continue to rise in the workplace in Japan. So a lot of women build their careers around their name. They build their reputation around it. And changing it after marriage could be quite damaging. Uchiyama remembers how everyone around her simply assumed that she's going to change her name. And nobody asked if her husband would do this. And Mr. Koike told me that when Ms. Uchiyama said she doesn't want to change her name and adopt his name, he was quite upset because he was raised under these norms that women will adopt the husband's name. But eventually he came to understand. He said the cause for reform is not about forcing all couples to use separate surnames. It's just about giving couples the choice. But the law as it stands, if people feel very strongly about it, do you think it actually has an effect on marriage rates? I do think there is an impact. To be clear, I'm not suggesting this is the main reason why the birth rate is falling in Japan. But I do think the surname law does have an impact on demographics as well. I don't know anybody personally going to extreme lengths like the couple I mentioned. But I personally do know a lot of women who have hesitated to get married because they didn't want to change their name. To some people, this might sound like a small or strange thing to get stuck on. But it really is an issue about women's identity and about people being able to be themselves even after marriage. And I also came across a survey recently that suggested if the surname rule were to be changed, hundreds of thousands of people in de facto marriages in Japan would shift to a formal marriage. And this is a very big deal in Japan, in a country where there's a lot of stigma around births outside of wedlock. So if people aren't in formal marriages, they often hesitate to have children. And you mentioned there was an attempt at some legislation here. This has become a full-on political issue in Japan now. Yes, it's become very politicized. I would say this is the Japanese answer to the culture wars. To make it very clear, it's not like most people in the general public are opposed to change. People are actually quite supportive of change. And there are surveys that suggest the majority of Japanese people are in favor of relaxing the rule. The same goes for a lot of politicians as well, even in the generally conservative ruling party. But the problem is that there's a very vocal far right of the party that are reluctant to challenge. I attended a gathering by an ultra-conservative group called Nippon Kaigi in Japan, which was all about the surname issue. And a lot of their talking points were things that I expected. So confusing children, creating discord in the family. But I was quite surprised at some point, one of the speakers was saying, this issue of allowing separate surnames is a communist plot by leftists to unravel society and weaken the country. I think this issue of surnames is very emblematic of a common pattern in Japan, where oftentimes the public is quite progressive and they're quite in favor of changing rules. But there's a handful of politicians who are staunchly opposed to change and will stall progress. Thanks very much for your time, Oika. Thank you so much for having me, Jason. You might have heard this song before. It's called I Like It. And in 2018, it topped the music charts, including the Billboard Hot 100. Since then, Bad Bunny, the artist behind it, has reached the top of global pop music. And he's done so all while promoting his music. Since then, Bad Bunny, the artist behind it, has reached the top of global pop music. And he's done so all while singing in Spanish. Which is a rarity for artists who want to appeal to mass audiences worldwide. Soon, Bad Bunny will be embarking on an international tour. In just a week, Bad Bunny sold over 2 million tickets for his gigs in Spanish-speaking countries like Chile and Spain. But also in Britain and as far afield as Japan. Okay, Sarah, take us back to the beginning. Why is he called Bad Bunny and where did he emerge from? Bad Bunny is a guy from Puerto Rico. His real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio. And rumor is he got his stage name from a childhood nickname based on a time he wore a bunny costume. Now, he started uploading his songs to SoundCloud, which is a streaming service, back in 2013. And by 2018, his songs were streamed over 2.5 billion times. And by 2024, that figure had jumped to 11.5. So he really sort of took off and took off fast. And he was the most played artist on Spotify every year between 2020 and 2022. Which is a milestone for any artist. Okay, I clearly need to add him to my playlist. But tell me what he's up to these days. Why are we talking about him now? All the buzz about him right now is because he just released an album in January called Debi Tirar Mas Fotos. Which means I should have taken more photos. Now, this record is a celebration of Latin music and of his Puerto Rican heritage. And he's starting his tour. So first, he's going to be in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, where he's going to spend two months doing 30 shows, playing every weekend until mid-September. I mean, all the dates are sold out. And it's also a huge contrast to what global stars usually do, right? Usually they go to Las Vegas. You've got Adele, Celine Dion, U2, you name it. And those performances make them millions of dollars. Now, Bad Bunny will also make profit with the tour. But he also says, I keep a foot in my island while I'm successful worldwide. And, you know, he really does. So one of the ways he keeps a foot in his island is by singing in Spanish. It used to be the case that Latin artists had to perform in English to make it big. So what's changed? I think he's changed things. He really has this attitude of I'm going to do whatever I feel like doing. And people kind of love him for it. So his 2022 album, Un Verano Sin Ti, which is A Summer Without You, was the first Spanish language record to be nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys. And in that album, he celebrates summer and love and passion and lust. And there are songs like Ojitos Lindos, which means beautiful eyes, that mixes classic beats of reggaeton, but also has a touch of trap, a sub-genre of hip hop from the American South. Or there's his song Baile Inolvidable, Unforgettable Dance, which is part of his recent album, which makes a very clear homage to salsa. And, you know, he takes these music types from Puerto Rico and they're incredibly catchy and he uses them and mixes them as he likes. It's a very distinctive sound. And his lyrics, too, they touch on things about politics often. So he criticized Puerto Rico's governor when there was a huge blackout. And he refers often to problems on the island, whether it's gentrification or other things. And it prompts his audience to be proud of who they are. And it also works with Latinos as well in the US, but across Latin America. Now, we should also mention there is a background and context to this, that there is this growing demand for Spanish language culture. There does seem to be a keenness, not just from Spanish speakers, but from others. So just to give you one statistic, Rosie, for the first half of 2024, viewers spent almost 7 billion hours watching shows in Spanish on Netflix. It's a huge number. So does his success then open the way for the success of other Latin artists in the future? He's such a one of global phenomenon that people say, you know, it's hard to know what make these super, super, superstars. But yes, I think in short, it does. He's made very clear that you can do what you want and be who you want and that can still bring you success. And he's succeeded in Spanish and he's doing it with pride. And the other thing is he's also deliberately trying to help other people. He showcases people. So you do see Puerto Rican artists in particular, but other Latinos sort of moving into his wake and trying to come along with him. And I think it also just hints or shows that global success doesn't have to come just when you sing in English. And that's definitely not only opening doors to other Spanish speaking singers, but potentially also singers in many other different languages, too. Sarah, thank you so much for talking to me. It's a pleasure, Rosie. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. We'll see you back here tomorrow. With so many options, why choose Arizona State University?
